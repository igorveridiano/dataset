When a series of apparently minor thefts plagues a university hostelry run by Miss Lemon's sister Poirot is recruited to investigate. Celia Austin a pharmacological major confesses that she is a kleptomaniac and responsible for most of the thefts but denies stealing several objects including a stethoscope light bulbs and a student rucksack. Furthermore she claims to know the other thief and vows to help return the missing items. Unfortunately someone substitutes an overdose of morphine for one of her sleeping powders and she takes the identity of the thief to the grave. Japp connects the murderer's m.o. with a cold case he had investigated ten years earlier but the prime suspect in that crime a powerful statesman now lies dying in a local hospital. Despite numerous obstacles Poirot is able to link the killing to an international diamond smuggling ring but not before the murderer claims more victims.::duke1029

Aided by Chief Inspector Japp he uncovers more than just robberies and a murder.::grantss
Hercules Poirot finds himself helping Miss Lemon's sister following a rash of thefts at the student rooming house she manages. The stolen objects are of only minor value - a stethoscope belonging to a medical student is perhaps the most valuable - but this adds all the more interest as far as Poirot is concerned. He soon learns that there is far more going in the residence than was first imagined including a strange looking character who works at a shop selling rucksacks and the presence of an undercover customs officer investigating a diamond smuggling ring illegally importing jewels from Amsterdam. With Mrs. Japp away Poirot insists that Inspector Japp move in with him setting the groundwork for an amusing clash of cultures.::garykmcd

"This is a remake of High Sierra with Humphrey Bogart and Ida Lapino.
Not quite as good as the original although obviously talented and great actors. Makes you wonder why they would remake a classic like High Sierra with minimal changes just 14 years later.
One interesting difference between the original and this movie... In the original they had a had a comical black man at the camp. The remake had a comical Hispanic. Both were incredibly insulting by current standards. It makes you wonder about the changes in culture from 1941 to 1955. They just found a new minority to insult."

"In the year 2022 the population has grown to 40 million people in New York City alone. Most housing is dilapidated and overcrowded and the homeless fill the streets and line the fire escapes stairways of buildings abandoned cars subway platforms etc. Unemployment is at around 50%. Summers are oppressively hot and humid with temperatures over 90F degrees during the day and night due to Earth's recent climate change resulting from the Greenhouse Effect. Food as we know it in this present time is a rare and expensive commodity. Most of the World's population survives on processed rations produced by the massive Soylent Corporation including Soylent Red and Soylent Yellow which are advertised as ""high-energy vegetable concentrates"". The newest product is Soylent Green: small green wafers which are advertised as being produced from ""high-energy plankton"". It is much more nutritious and palatable than the red and yellow varieties but like most other foods in short supply which often leads to weekly food riots.Robert Thorn (Charlton Heston) is a New York City Police Department detective from the 14th Precinct who lives in a dilapidated cramped one-room apartment with his aged friend and roommate Solomon ""Sol"" Roth (Edward G. Robinson in his last film). Roth is a former college professor whose job is to sort through the now-disordered remnants of written records and books to help Thorn's investigations. Roth and his like are known as ""books."" He tells Thorn about the time before the ecological disaster and population crisis of the early 2000s when real food was plentiful although Thorn is generally not interested in the stories finding most of them too hard to believe.Thorn is assigned to investigate the murder of William R. Simonson (Joseph Cotten) a 68-year-old wealthy lawyer living in a luxury high-rise apartment building called Chelsea Towers West. At the crime scene Thorn first talks with the building superintendent Charles (Philip Stone) about discovering the body. Charles leads Thorn to the 22nd floor and to Simonson's apartment which is 22A. Thorn finds Simonson lying in a pool of blood after having been struck multiple times in the back of the head with a sharp object which is speculated to be a meat hook or an ax. Instead of looking for clues the poorly paid detective helps himself to the wealthy man's food liquor and books and even enjoys taking a shower (with real hot water and soap). He questions Shirl (Leigh Taylor-Young) an attractive 23-year-old ""concubine"" (euphemistically known as ""furniture"") who comes with the apartment and Simonson's bodyguard Tab Fielding (Chuck Connors) who claims that he was told to escort Shirl on a shopping trip when the attack took place. The sanitation crew led by Wagner arrives to take Simonson's dead body away as Thorn leaves after collecting a statement from Fielding.Returning to his apartment Thorn gives Roth the Soylent Oceanographic Survey Report 2015 to 2019 a two-volume work which he took from Simonson's apartment. Thorn returns to work at the 14th Precinct during that evening where they're hundreds of people lining up to collect death benefit money from recently diseased friends and family members. Thorn talks to his superior officer Lieutenant Hatcher (Brock Peters) telling him that he suspects it may have been an assassination since nothing was stolen from the apartment and the murder seemed professional. Thorn also finds it odd that the luxury apartment's sophisticated alarm and monitoring electronics including the building's security cameras happened to be inoperative on the night of the murder and his bodyguard just happened to be out of the apartment at the time. Thorn confides in Lt. Hatcher that he suspects that Fielding might have had something to do with Simonson's murder.The next day Thorn stakes out Fielding's apartment building and sees him leave. Thorn lets himself into Fielding's apartment where he questions Fielding's live-in ""furniture"" Martha (Paula Kelly) about his work for Simonson. Thorn returns to his own apartment to eat an evening meal of the purloined food taken from Simonson's apartment that Roth prepares for them. Afterwards Roth tells Thorn about the research he did on the murder victim and that Simonson was a member of the board of directors of the Soylent Corporation. When he presents Roth with a spoon of strawberry jam surreptitiously palmed from Fielding's apartment Roth tastes it and declares that Fielding's ""furniture"" is eating some ""$150-a-jar"" strawberry jam which is an out-of-place luxury for the mistress of a bodyguard.That evening Thorn returns to the Chelsea Towers West to question Shirl who tells him that Simonson became deeply troubled in the days before his death even taking her to church. Shirl is throwing a party in Simonson's vacant apartment for the other ""furniture"" girls of the building. Just then Charles arrives and begins yelling and hitting the women for slacking off until Thorn arrives back in the living room to stop Charles from hurting the girls anymore. After sending Charles and the rest of the furniture girls away Thorn returns to Shirl and they make love.A little later that same evening Thorn goes to a local Catholic Church (teeming with hundreds of homeless people) and attempts to question the priest (Lincoln Kirkpatrick) about Simonson's confession but the priest is almost catatonic with exhaustion and has a hard time remembering Simonson even though Simonson as a rich man would have stood out among the impoverished people who normally frequent the church. When the priest remembers Simonson he tells Thorn the memory of what Simonson told him was haunting him and is unable to describe what Simonson said to him because it was ""too horrible"". The next day Fielding goes to the church and murders the priest to ensure he never talks again.The next morning as Thorn begins uncovering more evidence as to why Simonson was murdered New York State's Governor Joseph Santini (Whit Bissell) who was once Simonson's partner in a high-profile law firm and who is running for re-election (as shown in the campaign posters on such walls as that of Hatcher's office) instructs Hatcher to close the investigation. However Thorn continues his investigation into the murder. When Governor Santini learns that Thorn refuses to close the case of the Simonson murder he orders his chief of security Donovan (Roy Jensen) to have Thorn murdered.When Thorn is on riot duty during the Tuesday distribution of Soylent Green rations Simonson's murderer Gilbert (Stephen Young) a local assassin-for-hire whom was the one that Donovan contracted to murder Simonson attacks Thorn and fires several shots at him with a silenced pistol as a food riot begins. Thorn chases his attacker into the thick crowd as large dump trucks called ""scoops"" designed by the NYC Riot Police arrive to pick up closely packed rioters and ""scoop"" them into the trucks. But before Thorn can capture Gilbert who manages to wound Thorn by shooting him in his right calf the assassin is crushed to death under the ""scoop"" of one of the riot control vehicles.Thorn goes back to Fielding's apartment and beats him and his mistress Martha for the attempt on his life. Thorn then goes back to Shirl at Simonson's apartment where she removes the bullet and stitches his wound. Shirl tells Thorn that a new tenant will be arriving soon at the apartment and is hoping to move in but she has romantic feelings for Thorn. Thorn tells Shirl that he will let her know if she wants to stay with him or the new tenant of Simonson's apartment. After resting for about an hour Thorn leaves the apartment into the evening as sirens for the nightly curfew begin sounding. Sometime later a new potential tenant a brash high-class businessman arrives at the apartment and questions Shirl about herself and describes his daily details should he decide move in and want to keep her as ""furniture"".Meanwhile Roth examines Soylent's oceanographic reports at the Supreme Exchange a library and gathering place for fellow ""books."" The ""books"" and Roth finally realize that the reports indicate a ""horrible"" truth which despite reading it for themselves they find nearly impossible to believe; Soylent Green isn't made from plankton it's made from human bodies. Unable to live with what he has uncovered Roth opts for assisted suicide at a government clinic (in the former Madison Square Garden which had been converted to a clinic for mass euthanasia) a process referred to as ""going home"". As Roth is dying he watches video clips of Earth long ago when animal (sheep deer and horses) and plant life was thriving and there was no pollution while listening to light classical music.Thorn returns to his apartment and finds a note from Roth that he is ""going home"". Thorn races to the clinic and forces one staff attendant (Dick Van Patten) to allow him to see and talk to Roth. During Roth's final moments he tells Thorn the secret of Soylent Green and begs him to follow his body to the processing center and report back to the ""Supreme Exchange"".Thorn sneaks into the basement of the assisted suicide facility where he sees corpses being loaded onto waste disposal trucks. He secretly hitches a ride on one which is driven to a heavily guarded waste disposal plant just outside the city. The black-clad sanitation drivers are escorted at gunpoint out of the truck where a white-clad plant worker takes over driving. The sanitation worker is escorted to another truck leaving the fortress-like facility to drive back to the city. Once inside the plant Thorn sees how the corpses are processed into Soylent Green wafers. They are loaded onto a conveyor belt and driven through a large machine about several hundred yards long and the Soylent Green wafers come out on the other end. But Thorn is spotted by two plant workers and is chased. Thorn kills one and subdues another before he escapes from the plant just when the alarm is sounded.Thorn returns to the teeming city and heads for the Supreme Exchange to report what he found but is ambushed by Fielding and three other gunmen (all of whom presumably work for the government and are also aware and are trying to conceal the secret about Soylent Green). Thorn manage to get to a police payphone and call Shirl to tell her that he loves her and to stay with the new tenant whom wants to rent Simonson's vacant apartment. Thorn also manages to place a second call to Lt. Hatcher at the 14th Precinct to tell him where he is and that he is being attacked but then gets cut off when the assassins close in.During a chase through the deserted streets and alleys (cleared of people because of the government-imposed dusk to dawn curfew) Thorn manages to kill all the gunmen chasing him except for Fielding who shoots Thorn in the back. He retreats into a cathedral filled with homeless people and Fielding follows him. After a desperate fight through throngs of sleeping homeless Thorn kills Fielding by stabbing him with a rusted kitchen knife.When police backup arrives at the church the seriously wounded and nearly hysterical Thorn confides to Lt. Hatcher the horrible secret behind Soylent Green while Hatcher looks on with disbelief. As Thorn is being carried away by the police on a stretcher to a local hospital he urges to Hatcher to spread the word and shouts out to the spectators: ""Soylent Green is PEOPLE!! We've got to stop them... SOMEHOW!!!"""

"In the first regular episode of Columbo as part of the NBC Sunday Mystery Movie wheel Ken Franklin (Jack Cassidy) is one half of a best-selling duo of mystery writers. Unknown to the public however his contribution is merely handling the public relations for the team while Jim Ferris (Martin Milner) actually writes the books... Jim wants to end the partnership after the current ""Mrs. Melville"" mystery is completed and write on his own and this has caused a heated argument with Ken who see's his lavish lifestyle going up in smoke. However there is still the mutual life insurance policy that the partners have! While Jim is working at their office on a Saturday to finish the last chapter of the final book Ken visits him to apologize for blowing his stack previously and to ""grant the divorce"" that Jim seeks. He plays an obviously false practical joke with an unloaded revolver and breaks open a bottle of champagne to put Jim at ease. Furthermore Ken insists that Jim take a break and join him for the day at his new lakefront cabin which Jim has yet to see.We see the beginning of the murder plot when Ken 'accidentally' leaves his Dunhill cigarette lighter in the office and he must return to get it while leaving Jim in the car outside. He uses this time to place a list of names of west coast gangsters in a drawer and to then trash the office so it will look as though gangsters that Jim was allegedly researching for a book have done it and of course killed Jim. Nearing the cabin Ken stops at a local grocery store to pick up some supplies and also make an (untraceable in 1971) phone call to Jim's wife Joanna (Rosemary Forsyth) to establish that he is 2 hours away from the office... Later we find out that while he was using the pay phone Lilly La Sanka (Barbara Colby) the nosy widow who owns the store and has obvious designs on Ken Franklin has checked his car to see which girlfriend he has brought with him this weekend and spied Jim Ferris sitting in the passenger seat.Upon reaching the cabin Jim is uncomfortable about leaving town without telling Joanna so Ken tells him to call her and tell her that he's working late at the office as he has done so many times before. Again this is 1971 and people were still in the habit of using operators to place long-distance calls. Jim does precisely that and Ken has to stop him so that Joanna won't know that Jim is NOT calling from the office. This also establishes the direct-dial call on Ken's phone bill as though it is the call that he made to Joanna NOT from the pay phone at the market... During the phone call Ken shoots Jim with the pistol that now has cartridges in it and then Joanna calls the police and sends them to the duo's office.As a daring and useful way to dispose of JIm's body Ken returns to Los Angeles with Jim in the trunk of his car. He later dumps the body on his own lawn at night and calls the police telling them that this is a message from the 'gangsters' that he had better not follow in Jim's footsteps.Lilly La Sanka visits Kenwhile he was going out with sexy blonde Gloria (Lynette Mettey) at the door of a luxurious cinema. Lilly pesters Ken about the murder so that he is forced to talk to her. On a dine out at a restaurant Lilly asks Ken for $15000. She'll never ask him anything else afterwards but she wants to put a price to her silence just this once. They have a second date - in her home behind the store - where they drink a lot dine heartily and he says he'll give her the money and she insists that she's got class and honour so he won't hear of her afterwards. After drinking well and much she starts to realise the ackwardness of the situation. Knowing that he won't have a second chance he hits her on the head goes to one of her rental rowboats on the lake throws her body into the lake and their champagne bottles overturns the boat and swims to the shore.Columbo pesters him - he suspects something when he hears that a local shop assistant has died of a freak accident. The final clue is given to Columbo when he finds a scrap of paper on which Jim Ferris has written down an idea for book by Ferris and Franklin - this very same scenario.When Columbo arrests Ken the faux writer says that this murder plot really WAS his - the only really good idea he ever had.

"John Holmes and Dawn SchillerLos Angeles June 29 1981. We are first introduced to the teenage girlfriend of legengary porn actor John Holmes - the underage Dawn Schiller (Kate Bosworth). She is on the streets and is picked up by a holy roller named Sally (Carrie Fisher) after she and Holmes break up. She eventually calls Holmes to come and get her. Holmes (Val Kilmer) arrives at the apartment and they have sex and snort cocaine in the bathroom before being discoverd and flee the holy roller's house.After a 'drug-run' to a house located on Wonderland Avenue in the wooded Laurel Canyon neighborhood Holmes and Dawn check into a motel where they both get high from snorting more cocaine and freebasing. The next morning (June 30) Holmes leaves Dawn to travel to an answering service in Santa Monica to check his phone messages and mail where he has it sent leaving Dawn alone in the motel room with her pet dog to keep her company. He tells her that he will return in a few hours but Holmes does not return. During the night Dawn is woken up by a disturbing vision of violence. The next morning (July 1) Dawn continues to remain alone the whole day.While watching TV of the late afternoon news Dawn sees a newscast that states four people were murdered at a rowhouse on Wonderland Avenue in Laurel Canyon the same one she had been to with Holmes the day before. Shortly thereafter Holmes finally arrives back at the motel room looking tired and dishevelded and wearing different clothes then when he left two days prior. He does not want to talk about where he was and instead takes a valum pill and goes right to sleep.The story eventually moves onto two city detectives Nico and Cruz (Ted Levine and Franky G) investigating the crime scene and their contact with Holmes. Another officer and L.A. vice cop named Billy Ward (M.C. Gainey) intervenes with the investigation himself being a colleague of Holmes whom is his C.I. (Criminal Informant) handler.David Lind's storyThe next major character introduced is David Lind (Dylan McDermott). While getting drunk at a local bar he hears of his friends' murders at Wonderland on the TV set at the bar and soon discovers his girlfriend was there. While at the crime scene he is picked up by the same two L.A.P.D. Detectives Nico and Cruz (representing real-life detectives in the case Tom Lange and Bob Souza).Through Lind's story (told in flashbacks) we are introduced to some of the people who party at Wonderland during the early months of 1981. These people known as the Wonderland Gang include the gang leader Ron Launius (Josh Lucas) Billy Deverell (Tim Blake Nelson) Lind's 22-year old girlfriend Barbara Richardson (Natasha Gregson Wagner) the home owner Joy Miller (Janeane Garofalo) and Ron's wife Susan Launius (Christina Applegate). John Holmes drifted into the Wonderland Gang after attending several of their wild parties at the house. Soon unable to find enough work in the adult film industry to support his growing cocaine addiction Holmes begins muleing drugs for the gang. On more then one occasion Homes is accused of ""snorting"" or smoking some of the cocaine he is told to deliver to customers and he finds himself in trouble as he does not have the money to pay back Ron and the Wonderland Gang for the drugs he consumes for himself.Lind also explains that Ron had a fondness for antique guns and quite frequently shows them off. When Ron learns that Holmes knows a notorious gangster and nightclub owner an Arab immigrant with the alias of Eddie Nash (Eric Bogosian) he gives Holmes a pair of stolen antique guns to take to Nash so that Nash can fence them and they can split the loot.Earlier... Nash met and befriended Holmes because of Holmes' notoriety as the adult film phenomenon Johnny Wadd. Holmes takes the guns to Nash but Nash says the guns are too rare to be sold; they would be recognized right away and everyone involved would be apprehended. Rather than give the guns back to Holmes Nash keeps them for himself.Attempting to get back in the good graces of the gang Holmes suggests robbing Nash's home. Ron is reluctant to go along with the robbery at first but after Holmes gives him a rundown of what's there he is quite eager for the big score. Holmes volunteers to draw them a map to plan the robbery since he has been to Nash's house a lot. Holmes then visits Nash to buy drugs. On the way out he leaves the back door to the kitchen unlocked so the Wonderland gang can have easy access.The robbery of Eddie NashLind continues to describe his involvment in the robbery; The next morning (June 29 1981) the robbery is carried out by Ron Launius Lind and Deverell while wheel-man Tracy McCourt waits outside in a car serving as lookout. Neither Holmes nor any of the women are present when the robbery occurs. The Wonderland Gang gain access through the unlocked kitchen door and robs Nash at gunpoint. Lind accidentally fires his gun wounding Nash's 320-pound black bodyguard Greg Diles (Faizon Love). Racial epithets are hurled at Nash and Diles. The gang walks away with over one million dollars in cash jewels and drugs. They bring their loot back to the Wonderland house to divide everything up. Holmes is unhappy with the cut he is given even though he did not take part in the robbery. Ron tells him that it's conpensasion for drugs that he stole and squandered from them several weeks earlier.The next morning (June 30) Nash finds out that Holmes helped plan the robbery. After Holmes gets his phone messages and mail from his answering service he goes over to Nash's house where a gold necklace and ring he has on is recognized by Nash as one of the items stolen from his house the previous day.Nash has Holmes beaten and finds his little black address book. He tells Holmes he will kill every person listed in the book starting with his mother who lives in his hometown in Ohio then his estranged wife Sharon and his teenage mistress Dawn if he does not give up the men who robbed him. He also threatens to cut off Holmes' penis cut it into pieces and shove it down his (Holmes') throat.John Holmes storyTwo days after the murders both Holmes and Dawn are arrested by the police in their motel room and taken to police headquarters where they are both grilled about what they know about the Wonderland murders.Holmes is placed by Detectives Nico and Cruz at a safehouse at the Biltmore Hotel as part of a deal with Billy Ward to cooperate with their investigation. Holmes demands that Dawn join him as well as his estranged nurse wife Sharon (Lisa Kudrow) whom is contacted and allowed to stay in the safehouse.Holmes tells Ward Nico and Cruz a slightly different version of the events of the robbery. In this version (another extended flashback) Holmes claims that while he indeed stole drugs from the Wonderland Gang he felt threatened by them and they forced him against his will to plan the robbery of Eddie Nash's house. And on the following day after the robbery when Homes drove to the answering service in Santa Monica to pick up his phone messages and mail he claims that someone hiding in the back steat of his car put a gun to his head and forced him to drive to Eddie Nash's house where Nash confronted him about the robbery and that the robbers mentioned his name during the robbery. With Nash pointing a gun to Holmes head and aquring Holmes' black address book he threatened to kill Holmes as well as threatened to kill Holmes' mother in Ohio his older sister in Montana as well as his two older brothers his younger half-brother David Bowman plus Holmes estranged wife Sharon and teenage mistress Dawn. Holmes caved in and was forced to name the Wonderland Gang as the perps who robbed Nash who then responds by telling Homes: ""now you are going to do to those people on Wonderland what you did to me!""Holmes then admits to driving Nash's bodyguard Diles and three other heavies to the Wonderland house on the early morning hours of July 1 and buzzed the intercom to the house where he asked Ron to let him in (with Diles holding a gun to Holmes head the whole time). Holmes then suddenly stops his story and refuses to tell anymore except that he just walked away after letting the gang inside the house and did not see anything.Both Nico and Cruz have conflicting responses to the case. While Ward and Cruz belive that Holmes is telling the truth Nico belives Lind's story and that Homes partook in the killings himself for a left-handed handprint was found at the scene of the crime on the baseboard in the bed where Ron was murdered. Yet all of the officers are unsure who is really telling them everything; Lind a biker and crimminal with a heroin addiction and whom has a grudge against Holmes since his girlfriend was one of the victims; or Holmes a porn actor with a cocaine addiction and whom is known in the social circles as a sociopath and a patholoical liar.Holmes wife Sharon does not tell the police that (in another flashback sequence) that on the morning of July 1 a few hours after the murders took place she was awoken at around 4:00 am by Holmes who arrived at her house with his clothing splattered in blood. After helping him clean himself off and dispose of the bloody clothes Holmes confided in Sharon that he witnessed a quadruple murder involving the robbery of Eddie Nash that he masterminded the previous day. Sharon allows him to take some spare clothes for himself and he sees himself off. After returning to Dawn's motel room where he goes to sleep Holmes cries ""blood! blood! so... so much blood..."" in his sleep. Dawn is aware that something terrible happened but does not say anything to him or anyone else.About a week later with little evidence to hold Holmes on and due to his lack of cooperation Nico and Cruz release Holmes from house arrest but tell him that they will be contacting him soon again. Holmes tells Dawn and Sharon that they need to run because he suspects the police think he did the murders and worst still Eddie Nash might be comming after him too in order to make sure Holmes never talks about what really happened that night. Sharon refuses to leave town with them but instead gives Holmes and Dawn some money and sees them on their way.What really happened (July 1 1981)....The retaliation for the robbery is swift and fatal. At around 2:00 am on July 1 1981 a small group of Nash's henchmen (including Holmes) led by Diles gain access to the house at Wonderland Avenue where Holmes (with a pistol to his head as he described) buzzes the intercom and asks Ron to let him in. Immediately the gang attacks the people in the house while Diles forces Holmes to watch the massacre. Ron Launius Billy Deverell Barbara Richardson and Joy Miller are all brutally beaten to death with striated lead pipes with their blood and brain matter splattering all over the rooms where they are killed. Holmes is compelled by Diles to deliver blows to Ron Launius. Susan Launius is beaten but not killed. She survives and is questioned by Nico and Cruz in her hospital bed. She tells them (in a near comatose state) that she does not remember anything... only ""shadows"". (She wakes up during the attacks in her darkened bedroom to see two or three silhouette figures running into the room and immediately bashing her on the head several times with blunt objects. She is left for dead). Lind is not present during the attacks.The final scene has Holmes waking up from a nightmare of a flashback to the murders. He tells Dawn that the need to continue driving on since they pulled their car over for the night. Dawn suggests driving to her hometown in Florida and Holmes agrees while he turns on the radio to listen to Gordon Lightfoot's popular song ""If You Could Read My Mind"". Holmes starts up the car and speeds away into the light of dawn away from L.A. and to an unknown future.A disclaimer in the final shot reveals what happened to the characters involved:David Lind testified against Holmes during his 1982 murder trial for the Wonderland murders but could not offer any more evidence other than he had partook in the robbery of Nash's house. He died from a heroin overdose in 1995.John Holmes fled to Florida with Dawn where she later turned him in to the police. He was returned to Los Angeles where he was tried and aquitted in June 1982 of the four murders on Wonderland Avenue. He resumed his career in the porn industry shortly therafter. He died from AIDS in 1988.Dawn Schiller turned Holmes into the police in Florida after he beat and abused her where she left the country with her father where they lived in Thailand. She never saw Holmes again. She came back to the USA a few years after Holmes' death.Homes estranged wife Sharon was never called to testify against her husband during his 1982 murder trial. It was after his death that she came forward to reveal that Holmes visited her on the day of the killings. She divorced Holmes in early 1983 after his aquittal. She recently retired from her profession as a hospital ward nurse and has never remarried.Susan Launius survived the attack with serious brain damage. She testifed at Holmes murder trial but did not identify him being at the scene. She changed her name and her whereabouts are unknown.Eddie Nash was arrested in July 1981 after a police raid on his house uncovered several items stolen from the Wonderland house during the murders but his trial of masterminding the killings ended with a mistrial. A second trial in 1998 resulted with a conviction for posession of stolen goods and drugs but not murder. He was released on parole in 2001. He currently lives in Los Angeles... a free man."
In the police investigation of a brutal crime scene one man was at the center of it all: legendary porn star John Holmes.::MonkeyKingMA
John Holmes was a legend of the porn industry and revered in circles as a stud. But in 1981 years after his successful career and star fading Holmes was a desperate man with his own internal demons to live up to. He's estranged from his wife holding onto a relationship with his teenage mistress and living as a junkie in search of his next fix. But one fateful night left four people dead and John as a key suspect in one of the most grisly murders in Los Angeles. Was he partly responsible for what happened at Wonderland Avenue?::monkeykingma
On the afternoon of July 1 1981 Los Angeles police responded to a distress call at 8763 Wonderland Avenue in Laurel Canyon and discovered a grisly quadruple homicide. Drug dealers Ron Launius Billy Deverell Barbara Richardson and the homeowner Joy Miller were found brutally murdered bludgeoned to death with lead or steel pipes and Launius's wife Susan was left in critical condition. The police investigation that followed -- led by detectives Sam Nico Louis Cruz and Mike Peters -- would unearth a seedy world of drugs and violence ultimately revealing a motley crew from L. A.'s underbelly including ex-con David Lind nightclub impresario Eddie Nash and porn legend John Holmes as well as Holmes's estranged wife Sharon and his teenage lover Dawn Schiller.::Lions Gate
The movie looks at the events that led up to the infamous Wonderland Murders in Los Angeles on July 1 1981 as well as the investigation. What is known for sure is that four people were murdered in their Wonderland Avenue apartment apparently as retaliation for their robbery of a notorious L.A. nightclub magnate named Eddie Nash. What is not known is what part porn star John Holmes played in the murders. The police investigation relies on the testimony of two men: Holmes himself and a biker named David Lind who took part in a robbery of Eddie Nash's house two days earlier and whose girlfriend Barbara was one of the victims. Lind claims that Holmes had to have taken part directly in the murders (and in fact his hand print was found at the crime scene). However Holmes claims that he only set up the robbery and the hit but wasn't in the apartment at the time of the murders. Now the police are caught in a dilemma: who are they supposed to believe? A biker with a heroin habit who has a personal ax to grind against Holmes or a porn star with a notorious cocaine habit who is also known in many circles as a pathological liar?::jgp3553@yahoo.com

"Andy Hanson (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is a finance executive in desperate need of money to cover funds he embezzled from his employer which he stole to pay for drugs due to an upcoming audit. His brother Hank (Ethan Hawke) needs money to pay child support or else his ex-wife (Amy Ryan) will cut him out of his daughter's life. Andy devises a plan to rob their parents' jewelry store which Hank reluctantly agrees to. Andy argues that he cannot go himself because he has been in the neighborhood recently and could therefore be recognized. They assume that only the old woman who works for their parents will be in the store. Andy states that only a toy gun is needed and that it is a victimless crime because the insurance will repay their parents.Without consulting Andy Hank hires a co-worker who is also an experienced thief Bobby Lasorda (Brian F. O'Byrne) to help him in the robbery. In fact Bobby will do it himself (with a real and loaded gun); Hank just needs to wait in the car. The brothers' mother Nanette (Rosemary Harris) happens to be in the store herself filling in for the original clerk. The robbery goes awry when Nanette pulls a hidden gun on Bobby causing a shootout. Hank flees the scene after seeing Bobby shot to death. Nanette dies later in the hospital after her husband Charles (Albert Finney) agrees to take her off life support. Charles unsatisfied with the police's help decides to investigate on his own as he knows that Bobby had a partner in crime and becomes obsessed with finding the other criminal (Hank).Hank finds himself fixing many problems while Andy only chastises him for his mistake. After removing evidence he had left in the rented car he used for the robbery Hank is confronted by Bobby's brother-in-law Dex (Michael Shannon) who demands financial compensation for Bobby's death to provide for Bobby's widow/the in-law's sister Chris.Hank has secretly been having an affair with Andy's wife Gina (Marisa Tomei) who has been unsatisfied with her relationship to Andy. Gina reveals this to Andy at the point of leaving him. Upon hearing of Dex's blackmail Andy decides to fix the situation with Hank by robbing Andy's drug dealer. Once at the dealer's apartment they overpower the dealer and steal his money. Hank is then shocked when Andy murders the dealer and a client who happened to be present. The brothers then go to pay off Dex but Andy impulsively kills him for fear of blackmailing them further. When Hank objects to Andy wanting to kill Chris (partially because Chris and Bobby's child is heard in an adjacent room) Andy decides to kill Hank and reveals to him he knows about Hank and Gina's relationship. Before Andy can pull the trigger he is shot by Chris with her brother's gun. Hank leaves his brother and most of the money before fleeing.Charles had been following his sons this whole time having picked up their trail and found out they were behind the robbery.

Andy who pulls in six figures as the finance manager at a real estate office is nonetheless facing financial problems of his own making his white collar criminal activity to pay off his debts which is on the verge of being discovered which would ruin him completely. To get out of his bind Andy is able to convince an initially reluctant Hank who is facing his own more open financial problems in being behind in child support payments to commit what Andy calls a victimless crime: hold-up their parents Charles and Nanette Hanson's small Westchester jewelry store as they know not only the routine and key information having worked there themselves but that their parents would not lose anything in being covered by insurance and no violence would be required as the hold-up would occur when the Hansons' elderly employee Doris alone would just be opening the store. Andy is further able to convince Hank to carry out the actual robbery.

Remy also meets Scott's skinhead friends: Erik (Talbert Morton) James (Trevor St. John) and the weight-lifting hulking Knocko (Andrew Bryniarski).A few days later Professor Phipps challenges his class (including Kristen and Malik) to determine who they are for themselves and not let others categorize them.Kristen talks about her rape with Taryn with Taryn encouraging her to report it and attempting to console her.Malik confronts Phipps about a paper he graded arguing he should have a better grade. When Phipps shows him the various spelling and grammar errors Malik calls him a sellout for the ""white establishment"".

Taryn rebuffs her saying she wants Kristen to be sure about it.While stretching on the track Malik continues spouting Fudge's ideology to Deja saying he hates feeling like a thoroughbred.

The stretching and running is then intercut in a montage with a love scene showing they have started dating. Kristen is also seen going on a date with Wayne.Scott shows Remy his gun collection and Remy talks about his abusive survivalist father in his Idaho home town (which is the indirect result of Remy's troubled behavior and childhood).Kristen is shown walking holding hands with Taryn in public across the campus. They have a run-in with Monet and another friend of hers who see them. A montage love sequence is shown with Kristen where she sleeps with Wayne but fantasizes about Taryn. (In a deleted scene Kristen goes to Taryn's room and indeed has sex with her as well).One day while Malik and Deja talk about Christopher Columbus and of the college Remy approaches condemning Malik's Black Panther shirt and calling him a racial slur. Malik angered goes to Remy's room and confronts him about being a racist and Nazi after finding him reading a copy of Adolph Hitler's book 'Mein Kampf' (My Struggle). Remy backs down from a fistfight with Malik insulting him and leaving. Remy trashes the room contemplating suicide. After David returns he confronts Remy about the mess. Remy starts beating David and Malik intervenes. Remy pulls his Glock 9mm threatening the two and leaving. Malik runs after him only to be stopped by security guards asking for ID. Resisting he is arrested letting Remy escape. Malik then moves in with Fudge and the rest of his friends.A day or two later Malik and Fudge are relaxing on the student quad when they have a run-in with Professor Phipps and the three of them have a discussion on race knowledge and ""the system"". Phipps tells Malik that he must play the game of life to win because no one wants to hear excuses. It is here that Fudge used to attend Phipps class when he was a freshman years ago and Malik is somewhat surprised when Phipps addresses Fudge by his real name which happens to be 'Christopher White'. At the same time Kristen begins organizing a peace festival with Monet to calm down the students after Remy's actions.Meanwhile Scott chastises Remy for dropping out of school arguing that the white community needs more successful members and that he is betraying his race. After Knocko calls out a racial slur Fudge Malik Dreads and another black student start a gang fight with the white power skinheads beating them. Later Deja confronts Malik on his intentions of dropping out and fighting for no good reason. Malik is becoming more and more angry about racial issues. At the underground skinheads's dorm Scott says that Remy's posturing means nothing and only actions do. He then shows Remy a sniper rifle and challenges him to action. The alienated and warped Remy agrees to kill for the white race.We then see Malik and Deja walking at the Peace Fest with Malik saying he wouldn't drop out of college because he'd lose her. Kristen stands on the podum of the rally where she addresses the students while she sees both Wayne and Taryn standing separate among the students leaving Kristen feeling uneasy to both of them whom she is currently dating without the others knowledge. Remy has moved to the rooftop of a nearby building with the sniper rifle and prepares to open fire on the students. Erik stands lookout while the other racist skinheads attack a gay couple to distract security. Remy is obviously having trouble with doing this but acquiesces when pushed by Scott who tells him to ""do it for the Aryan Nation"". He opens fire on the Peace Fest causing a riot. An unnamed student is killed and Deja is shot in the stomach. She collapses in Malik's arms. After Phipps tries to help Malik goes crazy and attacks Remy meeting him on the stairs of the building and beating him severely and nearly choking him to death before racist security guards led by the racist Officer Bradley (Bradford English) intervenes and beats him. Bradley and his men confront Remy as he tries to leave. Remy pulls out a pistol resulting in a stand-off. Remy apologizes to the police for everything that he did and shoots himself in the head killing himself. After the security guards let Malik go he returns outside and finds that Deja has died and he collapses into Phipps' arms crying and wailing.The racist skinheads are shown mourning Remy's death when they see a TV news report of the university shooting. Knocko Erik and James then begin celebrating his actions chanting ""white power"". Scott quietly sits back and for a brief moment seems to smile.(It is strongly implied that Scott and his skinheads intentionally approached brainwashed and set Remy up as the patsy for their own actions taking advantage of the troubled youth to make him do their murderous deeds and they will get away with it since there is nothing to connect Remy to either Scott or his skinheads.)A few days later Malik and Phipps discuss his future at the university with Phipps saying he trusts Malik's judgment whatever it will be. Malik walks out of the office... making it unclear if he is going to drop out of the university or stay on. Afterwords Malik and Kristen are seen meeting for the first time at a memorial to Deja. Kristen feels guilty about the deaths because she started the festival. Malik assuages her guilt. And shortly after they part. Malik then begins to run at fast as he can through the campus... running for himself and not for the school.In the final scene a graduation ceremony is held where Fudge is seen finally graduating with the other students having long ago acquired all of the credits he needs but he refuses to wear a cap or smile for his graduation photo. As Professor Phipps leaves his office the final shot shows the USA flag fluttering in the wind as the caption ""unlearn"" appears over it as the image fades to black."

She retrieves the car jack and nearly has the large timber raised when the pin in the jack breaks. Doug and Helen decide that with a sturdy rope she can pull the timber with the car. Helen will have to drive back to the deserted service station to find a rope. They estimate that Helen should have four hours before the rising tide covers Doug completely threatening to drown him.

In the background sirens wail as the police approach. Lawson amazed by Helens loyalty and acting on a remnant of honor shakes Helens hand and leaves her with her husband and son.

"In May 1980 a Cuban man named Tony Montana (Al Pacino) claims asylum in Florida USA and is in search of the ""American Dream"" after departing Cuba in the Mariel boatlift of 1980. When questioned by three tough-talking INS officials they notice a tattoo on Tony's left hand of a black heart with a pitchfork through it which identifies him as a hitman and detain him in a camp called 'Freedomtown' with other Cubans including Tony's best friend and former Cuban Army buddy Manolo ""Manny Ray"" Ribiera (Steven Bauer) under the local I-95 expressway while the government evaluates their visa petitions.After 30 days of governmental dithering and camp rumors Manny receives an offer from the Cuban Mafia which he quickly relays to Tony. If they kill Emilio Rebenga (Roberto Contreras) a former aide to Fidel Castro who is now detained in Freedomtown they will receive green cards. Tony agrees and kills Rebenga during a riot at Freedomtown. The murder of Rebenga was requested by Frank López a wealthy politically astute man who deals cars and trades in cocaine as Rebenga had tortured López's brother to death while still in Cuba many years earlier.After getting their Green Cards Tony Montana and Manny Ray find work as dishwashers in a corner sandwich/taco shop. Some weeks later a López henchman and underboss Omar Suárez (F. Murray Abraham) the man who contacted Manny for the Rebenga hit job offers Tony and Manny a low-risk job of unloading marijuana from a boat from Mexico to arrive in Miami the following night for $500 each. Tony insults Suárez by turning down the job over the little money they will receive and demands at least $1000 for the work. After an altercation Suárez sets Tony up on another job to purchase two kilograms of cocaine worth around $25000 a piece from a Colombian dealer named Hector The Toad a medium to high-risk job for which Tony and Manny will receive $5000 for their work.That weekend Tony Manny and two other Marielitos in his crew whom they met in Freedomtown Angel Fernández (Pepe Serna) and Chi Chi (Ángel Salazar) then set out to meet ""Hector the Toad"" (Al Israel) at a seedy motel on the boulevard in Miami Beach. While Manny and Chi Chi wait in the car on the street Tony and Angel go up to the hotel room to meet with Hector. The meeting does not go smoothly as Tony grows irritated with Hector who is slow to give him the cocaine in exchange for money. Suddenly Tony and Angel are double-crossed by the Colombian. It becomes apparent that Hector does not intend to sell Tony the cocaine he has; he only wants to steal the money Tony has been given to purchase the product. To convince Tony to give over the cash Hector dismembers Angel in a shower stall with a chainsaw. After Angel is dead Tony about to suffer the same fate is saved by Chi Chi and Manny who arrive in the nick of time to gun down Hector's henchmen. Manny receives a minor bullet wound in his shoulder when his Uzi sub-machine gun jams. Hector escapes but Tony vengefully confronts him in the street and shoots him dead in the middle of the crowded Ocean Drive (the now famous Miami South Beach boulevard). Tony and his crew then get away with both the cocaine and the money before the police arrive.The following night Tony and Manny meet Frank López (Robert Loggia) at his house for the first time where Tony impresses Lopez with not only the return of his cash but with a gift of the cocaine a prize from the botched rip off. Frank immediately hires Tony and his crew into his criminal hierarchy a representative of a Cuban mafia. But during this initial get together Tony also meets Lopez's lady the blond and beautiful Elvira Hancock (Michelle Pfeiffer) who will eventually become the source of tension between the two men. Taking Tony and Manny out to a local nightclub called The Babylon Club where Frank frequently attends Tony and Manny see first-hand the high standard of living they have come to acquire. Though Frank actually warns against these excesses Tony is seduced by them regardless. Thus Tony Montana begins his rise through the ranks of the Miami cocaine underworld.After three months Tony has advanced in the ranks in Frank's cartel from drug runner and purchaser to a trusted lieutenant along with Manny. They work low-risk jobs such as being Frank's bodyguards and messengers. Tony continues to grow more attracted to Elvira as he helps her purchase a new Cadillac vehicle for herself and casually flirts with her privately. Elvira enjoys the attention but still seems to think of Tony as a low-level hood.Tony attempts to make amends by meeting with his estranged family. It is implied that Tony's father a former U.S. Navy sailor abandoned the family when Tony was little. Since then his mother (Miriam Colon) and younger 19-year-old sister Gina (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) have been living in Miami. Tony shows up at his mother's and Gina's house one evening fashionably dressed and offers them $1000 in cash for financial support. Gina is overjoyed to see her older brother whom they have not seen for five years. However Tony's mother has only scorn for him since he turned his back on them many years ago for the quick and easy life of crime back in Cuba and wants nothing to do with him. She is too full of pride to accept his money despite being financially stricken. But Gina who idolizes her brother follows him outside where he slips her the money secretly. Gina tells Tony that she wants in on the flashy life that he has going for him. Tony's love for Gina is clearly genuine for she's the only person that he trusts and is also obsessively protective of her. Afterward Manny (who waited in the car that he and Tony arrived in) makes a comment to Tony about how attractive Gina is but Tony angrily warns him to stay away from her.Several months later Tony is sent to Bolivia to help Omar set up a new distribution deal with Bolivian kingpin Alejandro Sosa (Paul Shenar) for the purchase of 200 kilograms of cocaine since Frank is having legal troubles that preclude him from leaving the country. Though Tony was supposed to let Omar do all the talking Omar proves to be a poor negotiator prompting Tony to step in and save the deal. They seem to negotiate a deal that on the surface seems favorable to both sides with Sosa overseeing the transportation to Panama and to let Tony and the Lopez cartel take over from there but Omar insists that Frank would not approve. Sosa seemingly sides with Omar and suggests that Omar use his phone to call Frank. A few minutes later Sosa hands Tony binoculars and he sees two menacing assassins Alberto the Shadow (Mark Margolis) and the Skull (Geno Silva) execute Omar by hanging him by the neck from an airborne helicopter. Sosa reveals that Alberto recognized Omar as once being an informant for the police several years ago when he worked in New York City... and Sosa has a zero tolerance for disloyalty. Tony insists that he never goes back on his word and that he never trusted Omar. Believing that Tony is trustworthy Sosa agrees to bring Tony on board with him as his North American distributor of cocaine and other drugs. But upon their agreement Sosa sternly warns Tony never to betray or double-cross him in any way.Upon his return to Florida Tony is verbally chewed out by Frank for overstepping his authority as well as hearing about Omar's death. Tony explains to Frank that for a price of $18 million to pay Sosa for the manufacturing and transportation costs they will receive 2000 kilograms of cocaine from Bolivia for nationwide sale and distribution which will earn them $75 million over a period of one year. Frank is worried because he does not have the many millions to pay Sosa for the cocaine but Tony says that he is in tight with Sosa and he has established a ""credit line"" with him as well as work out a payment plan where they will pay Sosa $5 million up front and the rest in monthly installments. Plus in case Frank comes up short a few million Tony will earn the money needed through his own street contacts. Frank angrily tells Tony that he did not negotiate a good deal and that Sosa merely tricked him into thinking he did. Tony replies that it's time for them to ""think big"" and to expand the cartel for nationwide distribution of cocaine. With them as the main North American distributors and wholesalers of the Sosa cartel they will make millions and become the biggest cartel in the continent. Frank warns Tony that Sosa cannot be trusted and that he will sooner or later turn against them for any slight deviation or compromise of his business. Frank orders Tony to stall his deal with Sosa for the time being. Frank then promptly tells Tony that ambitious drug dealers such at himself who want too much and crave money power and attention do not last long in the business. Tony leaves shrugging with indifference and strikes out on his own.After this incident Tony then seeks out Elvira to whom he makes an unexpected marriage proposal. She is shaken but agrees to think about it. Frank López is none too happy when he hears about it and decides to take out Tony.At the Babylon nightclub that evening Tony is approached and shaken down by a Miami police detective named Mel Bernstein (Harris Yulin). He proposes to ""tax"" Tony on his transactions in return for police protection and information. Tony is distracted by the sight of Gina dancing with a local drug dealer. He follows the two to a restroom stall where he berates Gina for her promiscuous conduct. He asks Manny to take her home. On the way Gina admits she is attracted to Manny. Manny wards her off mindful of Tony's obsessive protection of her.Back at the nightclub Tony is attacked by two gunmen but manages to escape killing them both despite being wounded by a gunshot to his left shoulder. Suspecting Frank sent Bernstein and the hitmen Tony asks one of his bodyguards Nick The Pig to call Frank after Tony arrives at Frank's office at 3:00 a.m. that very night and inform him the hit failed. Tony Manny and Chi Chi visit Frank at his car dealership back office who is with Det. Bernstein. Nick calls Frank who confirms his involvement by playing the call off as Elvira telling him she'll be late home. When it becomes apparent that Bernstein (who is armed) will not help him Frank begs for Tony's forgiveness saying that he can have Elvira and ten million dollars in exchange for sparing his life. Tony will have none of it and Manny coldly executes Frank. Bernstein insists that he could be a valuable ally for Tony but Tony disagrees and kills him too.His problems apparently solved Tony begins a profitable relationship with Sosa over the next year and-a-half. Tony marries Elvira buys a huge mansion complete with surveillance cameras and numerous luxury items and Tony even sets Gina up in business with her own beauty salon complete with a paid staff. Manny and Gina soon begin a romantic relationship but they keep it secret from Tony who had firmly stated to Gina that he does not want her dating anybody (at least not anyone in the drug dealing business).As Tony's business grows so does his cocaine addiction and paranoia and he begins to spiral out of control... the beginning of the end. His wife who becomes further addicted to cocaine becomes bored and emotionally distant. Tony's banker informs him that laundering the increasing flow of drug money has become increasingly difficult so he will be charging higher fees up to 10%. A Jewish mob boss Mel Seidelbaum (Ted Beniades) contacts Manny offering his assistance. However as they are cleaning out the money Seidelbaum reveals himself to be an undercover cop and arrests Tony. After posting a $5 million in bail Tony's corrupt lawyer Sheffield tells him that although he may get him cleared of the corruption and money laundering charges Tony will probably have to serve at least three years in prison for tax evasion. Manny suggests that he take it as the American prison system is nowhere near as harsh as its Cuban counterpart and the right legal loopholes could trim the sentence down to six months. However the strung-out Tony yells that he would rather die than spend a single day in jail.After hearing about Tony's arrest Sosa not wanting to lose his main distributor offers Tony a way out of going to prison. He calls Tony back to Bolivia where he introduces him to his cocaine ""board of directors"" a group that includes a sugar land baron Bolivia's military chief and a mysterious American named Charles Goodson (Gregg Henry). We assume he is a corrupt CIA officer because Sosa guarantees that the IRS will not be able to send Tony to jail. But this help comes at a price. A Bolivian journalist is attempting to expose the ongoing corruption in the Bolivian government involvement in drug trafficking and his crusade is beginning to hurt Sosa and his partners. Sosa will be sending Alberto to New York assassinate the journalist but he needs Tony and his crew to provide some extra muscle. Tony is clearly disturbed by the assassination since it is against his custom to kill a man whom he sees as a civilian plus Tony has never killed anybody who didn't wrong him personally. But seeing no other options Tony reluctantly agrees to help Sosa with the hit.In the meantime Tony's marriage with Elvira finally ends when after a bitter altercation at a local restaurant she finally expresses her contempt for him and the lives he had led her on and walks out of the restaurant and out of his life. Tony punch-drunk on cocaine tells the restaurant's other patrons that his existence is necessary since society needs a man like him to call a criminal. Tony also informs Manny to look after things while he travels to New York on business (but he doesn't tell him anything about the Sosa assassination deal.)Tony with his two trusted henchmen Chi Chi and Reuben and Alberto travel to New York City and Alberto places a bomb under the journalist's car in with the intention of detonating it outside the UN building before the the man addresses the General Assembly and exposes Sosa's cartel. But Tony has second thoughts when the journalist unexpectedly picks up his wife and children. Tony saying that the team was only supposed to kill only the journalist shoots Alberto to prevent the journalist's family from being killed. When authorities later discover the unexploded bomb underneath the journalist's car they realize that an execution had been planned and increase the amount of security protecting the journalist. Sosa is now the primary suspect and Sosa vows to get even with Tony.Returning to Miami Tony discovers that Gina and Manny (who opposed the trip to New York) have disappeared. Tony visits his mother again where she angrily tells him about Gina's descent into an immoral life and accuses him of corrupting her with his flashy lifestyle. After getting Gina's home address from Mrs. Montana Tony goes to the house in nearby Palm Grove. Much to Tony's surprise Manny unexpectedly opens the door in his bathrobe. Tony then sees Gina in a night gown at the top of the stairs. Enraged that another man has obviously slept with his sister Tony shoots Manny dead. Hysterical Gina reveals to Tony that they had just been married and were going to surprise him. Tony riddled with guilt has Gina taken back to his mansion.In revenge for Tony's failure to kill the journalist who has now exposed Sosa and his partners to the world as drug lords Sosa sends a Latino mercenary hit squad (the size of a large platoon) to Tony's mansion to kill him that evening. Sitting at his desk snorting from an enormous pile of cocaine Tony realizes and regrets what he has done to his best friend. He takes a call from Sosa and berates him telling him he's prepared for whatever Sosa can throw at him. When Tony is contemplating his actions Sosa's mercenaries breach the main gate at Tony's estate and quietly begin to kill all the guards around the mansion. At the same time a distraught Gina wearing only an unbuttoned sleep shirt and armed with a revolver enters Tony's office to confront him with the truth about his feelings for her. She now realizes that Tony loves her in an unnatural way and demands at gunpoint that he make love to her. She begins to shoot at him while demanding he take her. A Sosa assassin hiding on the balcony thinking Gina is shooting at him leaps in and riddles her with bullets. An enraged Tony throws the man off the balcony and kills him with his sub-machine gun creating a storm of chaos at the mansion. At this point the mercenaries robbed of the element of surprise by the gunshots swarm in to attack Tony's mansion from all directions.As all his men are being killed including Reuben and Nick the Pig Tony still delirious from the cocaine leans over Gina's dead body begging for forgiveness at the same time the mercs break into the mansion. Chi Chi opens fire with an Uzi as he falls back and ends up banging on the door to Tony's office (it has been locked from the inside by Gina who was planning to kill Tony). Unfortunately Tony does not seem to hear him. Chi Chi is shot in the back and Tony sees it on the security cameras.As the hit men prepare to storm into his office Tony finally snaps out of his drug-induced state arms himself with an M16A1 assault rifle with an under-mounted M203 grenade launcher and blows down the door. A huge climatic gun battle begins as Tony takes position atop the grand staircase and guns down dozens of Sosa's men who try to storm the balcony. Tony is hit a number of times by return fire but he keeps shooting. With most of Sosa's men dead Tony strung-out on drugs defiantly yells out at the assassins not realizing that the Skull has sneaked into the room behind him. The Skull shoots Tony in the back with a 12-Gauge shotgun. Tony falls off the balcony and into a reflecting pool at the base of the grand staircase. In the final shot as the Skull and the few surviving assassins look on Tony Montana lies dead... face down in the bloody reflecting pool which is located below a large brass globe that says: THE WORLD IS YOURS."

"A young college coed is leaving school for the day. She jumps on her bike and heads home. Upon arriving she calls out to her cat to come for her meal. She spies the cat cowering under a table growling softly. Just as she comes close to reassure her cat a mysterious figure comes out from the shadow and violently attacks her.Quick cut to college professor Andy Safian (Bill Pullman) and Detective Dana Harris (Bebe Neuwirth) at the hospital discussing the ongoing problems with campus security. Jed Hill (Alec Baldwin) the new surgeon at St. Agnes hospital works feverishly to save the girl even though he is told ""we're going to lose her."" The surgery is successful. In the locker room Hill tells the surgeon who made the comment that while he wants to make new friends if he ever says something like that again he will ""remove (his) lungs with a f***ing ice cream scoop.""Andy and Jed meet to discuss the girl's condition. After a moment Andy realizes that he knew him from their old high school Van Buren. They hope to see each other around.Andy goes to see his wife Tracy Kessinger (Nicole Kidman) at work. As they talk in the elevator Dr. Hill steps in with a colleague. They are invited to a reception to welcome Jed to the hospital. They politely decline and leave. As they walk along the street they talk about the new plumbing for their Victorian house will cost them $14000. Tracy suggests renting out the third floor to a tenant but Andy refuses. He also suggests that she be very careful coming home from work a maniac being on the loose.When she arrives home. Andy notices his wife getting out of the car with a man who gives her a gentle peck on the cheek. She had told him she was coming home with a woman. She claims the man is a lawyer who is handling old buisness with her mother's estate. Andy apologizes. Later they are eating Chinese food in bed and she seductively feeds him and she gently gyrates on his lap. They begin to have sex when Andy quickly turns off the light noticing their next door neighbor's young son is watching them. (He assumes this because of the silhouette in the window). Tracy doesn't seem bothered by it since the mother works nights and the boy might just be lonely.The next morning Andy is sanding the stair railing and is surprised by Jed's appearance in the front doorway. They have a pleasant conversation and Jed invites him to go out for a drink. Jed happens to point out a Degas statue and asks if it's the real thing. Andy assumes it is.As they are drinking Andy lets it slip that his wife has been having trouble getting pregnant. He mentions a doctor named Lillianfield that Tracy has been going to. Jed says he ""is a good man."" When he gets home he suggests to Tracy that Jed take the third floor as a tenant. Tracy does not seem thrilled with the idea even suggesting that Andy is doing it to relive his high school years again hanging with the star quarterback. When she finds out that Andy discussed her problem with Jed she is annoyed but not mad. She gives in and says it's OK for Jed to move in. The doorbell rings and she asks Andy if he wants to bet if it's Jed. He says no. ""Because when money is involved you take me seriously"" she mutters.Detective Harris comes in while Andy is in the middle of a session with Paula Bell (Gwenyth Paltrow). He asks his secretary to make sure she gets a wake up call in order to not miss her next class. Harris tells Andy that not much progress is being made on getting the rapist. Andy laments that he is tired of seeing students leaving the school for fear of their safety. She asks for a list of people who have access to the student's schedules.Tracy comes home and prepares to take a bath. Her pain shoots up again and she is startled when Jed appears in the bathroom to check on her. They share a long glance as they hear Andy announce that he is home. Later that night Jed is involved in a sexual marathon with one of the nurses from the hospital. Tracy is extremely annoyed because the noise is keeping her awake. As Andy is about to go ask him to hold it down the noise stops. The nurese jokes with him that the only reason he is a doctor is for the money and women. He laughs and jokes about his tolerance with alcohol. After coming out of the bathroom Tracy stares coldly as the nurse runs naked to the upstairs bathroom.The next day. Andy is annoyed that Paula still has not shown up for her appointment. After talking to his secretary he decides to go to her house to check on her. He arrives and the house is completely quiet. He calls out for her but gets no answer. The front door is open so he lets himself inside. He then notices the back door is slightly ajar and that a lock of her hair is on the floor. He walks out back and notices one of her shoes. He then approaches the hedges and finds her brutalized body hidden inside. Detective Harris says he will need to provide a statement.Leter Jed tries to cheer up Andy at the bar. He relays a story about the first time he saw a dead body in medical school. After Jed makes a comment about pro athletes not being able to stay clean for a million dollars Andy says he would ""give his right arm"" for a million. Jed presses him on it saying what if was a surgical prcedure. Would he do it? Andy says no as does Jed after cracking an ice cube in his mouth. Andy heads home as Jed decides to check on the local women playing darts.Andy comes home and Harris is waiting for him. She tells him there is circumstantial evidence tying him to the rapes. He is outraged at being considered a suspect. She then tells him he needs to come to the station to provide some sperm to rule him out. Reluctantly he agrees to go.Tracy comes home and her pain is now unbearable. She calls out for Andy but he is still at the station. She calls 911. While chatting it up with the dart ladies and drinking bourbon Jed is paged to the hospital where he sees that Tracy is the person he needs to operate on. Back at the station Andy is ruled out as a suspect and as he is leaving is told his wife called 911. He rushes to the hospital.It turns out one of her ovaries has ruptured and needs to be removed. They discover that she was 4 weeks pregnant but she miscarries due to the trauma. A doctor notices a problem with the second ovary and Jed says they need to get a histology report to make sure it isn't still a live ovary. They realize they don't have the time to do it. Jed goes out and tells Andy the options. They can remove the ovary and she'll be fine (but never able to have kids). Or they can leave the ovary in and hope she does not die from toxic shock. Andy says to do whatever he needs to. He tells Andy that she was 4 weeks pregnant but the baby is gone. Jed goes in and against the advice of fellow surgeons he removes the other ovary.Later it comes to light that he removed a healthy ovary. Jed has the chance to bury the report but declines. He stands by his judgement call. The turn of events destroys Tracy. She tells Andy she is leaving him and she files a lawsuit against Jed Hill for $20 million.At the deposition Jed is made out to be a top notch surgeon but has a ""God-complex"". He states that when people go into the chapel and pray to God that their loved ones will be alright who does the lawyer think they are praying to. ""You ask me if I have a God complex. Let me tell you something. I am God."" He then gets up and walks out. Tracy's lawyer then mentions they know he was drinking the night of her surgery. They decide to settle. Tracy doesn't seem to care about the money. As she exits the building she notices Andy across the street. She shoots him a cold stare and then leaves in her lawyer's car.Back at work Andy is working late into the night when one of his bulbs goes out. He goes downstairs and finds the janitor (Tobin Bell) has a makeshift place and is living down there. He finds a lock of hair on the night table as well as in a cigar box. He is startled when he appears behind him. He explains that he got kicked out of his old place and this is just temporary. Andy says not to worry about it and leaves. As he is walking away he is jumped from behind and he ends up fighting him off and rendering him unconscious.At the station Detective Harris invites Andy to get a drink. While there she talks about how her family accuses her of wielding her honesty like a blunt instrument. She tells him that there is something he needs to know about his wife. Something important. He goes back to the station with her.Later he goes to Jed's hotel to tell him that thet baby was not his. It turns out that Andy is sterile (which cleared him of the rapes). Jed tells him it doesn't change anything regarding his situation. He feels bad for Andy and says that bad things happen to good people all the time for no good reason. Andy suspecting that maybe Tracy's lawyer is the father goes to confront him.Andy barges in and accuses her lawyer (Peter Gallagher) of having an affair with his wife. He says he did not. But since he cannot give him any information about where she is he should talk to her friends or mother. Andy says he should know her mother is dead since he handled her estate. He says he never did. As he is leaving he suggests that Andy bring her a bottle of scotch.Andy arrives and uses the bottle of scotch to entice Tracy's mother (Anne Bancroft) to open the door. They talk about Tracy's childhood how she always stashed away any money she had how her father abandoned her and took her hidden money. As she is drinking she laughs about how gullable Andy is. He says he knows she has been there becuase of the Degas statue on her mantle. She laughs and say you can get one of them anywhere. She then tries to get him to do a card trick and asks him to bet. He says no. ""Because when money is involved you take me seriously."" She then tells him he should just ""get into the game"" and go for the $20 million himself. When he brings up Dr. Lillianfield she smiles and tells him ""Welcome to the game.""He finds Lillianfield's address through a ruse using a change of address excuse. He finds out the address and lies in wait inside the house. He hears Tracy as she comes in the door. To his horror Dr Lillianfield turns out to be Jed Hill. They kiss passionately as she orders him to take her upstairs and have sex with her. After they go upstairs Andy leaves the house devestated.He goes home and knocks a bunch of items from her dresser to the floor. But he notices something odd. There is a syringe with some liquid still inside of it. He then notices they neighbor's son's silhouette again playing on his keyboard.As they walk along the beach the next morning Jed laments about how his mentor wrote him a letter saying he was sorry about everything. While Tracy finds it amusing Jed is upset that his mentor never apologized about not giving him the chief of staff job at Mass General. They kiss and head back to the house to make love again. While she is laying on the bed a syringe sticks her. Jed realizes that now Andy knows what it going on that he has been in the house. Jed rehashes the plan and lets Tracy know the improvised part of her getting pregnant was what tipped Andy off. He figured out there was no Dr Lillianfield. Tracy says to let her handle him.At a bar/restaurant Tracy acts all loving and seductive with Andy trying to convince him that things can go back to normal. She runs her foot up his leg until Andy tells her that she dropped her shoe. She realizes that her ploy is not working. She then goes on the attack trying to intimidate him saying that if he goes to the police that will make him look crazy. She gets up and wishes him ""happy hunting."" Andy then tells her to ""sit the f*** down."" He tells her he knows what was in the syringe and that the lab guys told him that the substance in the syringe could cause the ovarian cysts she got if injected in massive doses. He then suggests that maybe he should have put curtains up in the bedroom because someone might have seen her injecting herself to cause the cysts. Enraged she shatters a wine glass in her hand. He then warns her that if anything is to happen to him the police will go to her neighbor's son. He wants half the money.Back at the house Jed suggests strongly they give him the money and they should leave the country. He tells her they don't have a choice. She then suggests that without the kid there is no case. He is horrified by the suggestion. He then slaps her and tells her not to bring it up again. If something happens to the kid he will be the state's star witness against her. She then pulls out a gun and kills him.Tracy waits outside her former neighbor's house and waits for her to leave. She calls Andy and tells him she has his money. He gives her a meeting place and then heads out in his car. After he leaves she approaches the neighbor's house. She then silently walks upstairs and slowly approaches the boy with plastic wrap while he is playing his keyboard as usual. She puts it around his head only to find that it is really a CPR dummy from the police station. Tracy goes ballastic smashing the dummy on the keyboard. Andy turns out the light and taunts her saying ""Like shooting tuna in a barrel huh?"" She lunges for him and they fall through a bannister and land on the floor. As she is about to get up Detective Harris dressed as the neighbor (she is a nurse) stomps on a piece of wood Tracy is preparing to pick up saying ""I won't mind shooting you."" She tells Andy he may need a doctor. He laughs.Tracy is led out to the police car and sees the neighbor and her BLIND son go back into the house. She is stunned. She looks at Andy with a mixture of sadness shock and belatedly respect. The car drives off and Harris and Andy sit on his porch. She suggests he needs ice. He says he'll take his with some scotch. They head off in her car.THE END

Though grossly outnumbered the GSE manage to hold their ground until reinforcements chase off the Birmingham firm. Matt does well in his first true fight and is inducted into the GSE. After a row with Steve Matt moves in with Pete and the two exchange stories. The GSE firm then head to an away game against Manchester United. Matt was not meant to come but ends up sneaking onto the train. Whilst on the train they are pre-warned that 40 ManU firm members are waiting for them at the station. Bovver hits the emergency stop button which allows the GSE to get off at an earlier stop (Macclesfield). Having failed to find a taxi they persuade a van driver to take them into Manchester. Matt sits in the front of the van with the driver; the rest of the GSE are in the rear. As the van approaches the ManU fans Matt tells them that they are moving equipment for a Hugh Grant film so the fans let them through. When past them he stops the van opens up the back and the GSE charge out to attack the ManU firm members. They win the fight and run away singing ""There's your famous GSE"". It is soon revealed to Matt that the GSE's sworn enemy is Millwall's firm led by Tommy Hatcher (Geoff Bell) whom Bovver makes negotiations with after getting jealous of Matt. After one of the members of the firm see Matt meeting his father a renowned journalist for The Times for lunch they assume Matt is a ""Journo"" as well. Bovver informs Pete about this and when Steve finds out he goes to the Abbey to warn Matt. Matt finds out that Steve used to be ""The Major"" of the GSE. When Steve was The Major the last game he went to was against Millwall to which Tommy Hatcher brought along his 12-year-old son whom Tommy had raised to be hard. The son was killed in the ensuing fight. Since then Tommy Hatcher ""lost it"" and blamed Steve and the GSE for his son's death. After seeing this happening Steve left football hooliganism for good.At that moment Bovver arrives and there is a big argument in the Abbey in which Bovver comes out humiliated. Infuriated he goes to Millwall's local and asks Tommy Hatcher to attack The Abbey. Initially reluctant Tommy Hatcher agrees upon learning that Steve is there. The Millwall firm crash the Abbey and petrol bomb the bar. Tommy Hatcher confronts Steve Dunham. Steve's attempt to convince Tommy Hatcher he is no longer involved in the GSE only reminds Tommy Hatcher of his son and he stabs Steve in the neck with a broken bottle telling him ""If you die tonight you and me are even."" Bovver who had been knocked out by Tommy Hatcher comes round just in time to help Steve. At the hospital Pete blasts Bovver for his betrayal. In the aftermath the two firms meet near the Millennium Dome for an all-out brawl. Matt and Bovver show up to fight for the GSE but during the fight Matt's sister Shannon turns up with their son and are attacked by a Milwall hooligan. Matt and Bovver come to their rescue. Pete notices that Tommy Hatcher is approaching the car and distracts Tommy by taunting him to ""finish him off."" When Tommy Hatcher declares to have finished with him Pete then declares that Tommy Hatcher was to blame for his son's death having failed to protect him (""He was your SON!""). Tommy Hatcher driven to insanity attacks and kills Pete all the while shouting out a variation of the words to the chant 'Only a poor little Hammer' using it as an analogy for Pete's condition. The fight completely halts at this point and Tommy Hatcher is eventually pulled off Pete by some of his friends as he breaks down in tears. Everyone on both sides gathers around Pete's dead body in shock with Bovver sobbing at his side.Matt returns to the United States and confronts Jeremy Van Holden in a restaurant toilet where Jeremy is snorting cocaine. Jeremy arrogantly tells Matt to leave. Matt then pulls out a tape recorder and plays back what Jeremy just said including their discussion about how the cocaine in Matt's room was Jeremy's saying that it is his ""ticket back to Harvard."" Jeremy lunges at him to try and get the tape but Matt casually reverses the attack and raises his fist as if to punch Jeremy. He does not do so but instead walks out with a smile as Jeremy collapses to the floor defeated. The film ends with Matt walking down the street outside the restaurant singing ""I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles."""

Unjustly expelled from Harvard when a stash of cocaine is found in his possession Matt moves to London to live with his sister and her husband Steve. He is quickly introduced to Steve's chirpy cock-sure younger brother Pete.

On the way back from a football match Matt is viciously accosted by a gang of Birmingham City thugs until Pete and his friends step in and save him. It is from here that Matt learns the truth about Pete and his friends- they are football hooligans operating the GSE (Green Street Elite) 'firm.' Initially afraid of the violence Matt soon ends up becoming as desensitized to it as his new found friends - but as events roll on suspicion shocking revelations and unsettled scores combine to a devastating climax where London's most fierce football rivals - Millwall and West Ham United - are set to go head to head.::davidgraham83@hotmail.com

The true number of kidnapped victims and the assailant's motive comes to a haunting reality when nine strangers find themselves handcuffed to nine separate poles in a bunker built by the masked gunman who is hell bent on revenge.

""I have brought the nine of you here for a reason. Your survival depends on you figuring out what that reason is. I will leave you alone for you discussions but I will return over ten minutes and kill one of you until you figure out why I have brought you here or until you are all dead."" And with his single deadly statement the gunman closes the bunker door leaving the nine stranger scared desperate and unsure of who will be the first one killed or if any will live. They confess their worst crimes sins and innermost fears hoping to find the connection that will keep them alive. As each ten-minute period expires the gunman re-enters the bunker and asks his one simple question. ""Why are you here?""

"The film opens with an out-of-focus image of what appears to be a swarm of bugs crawling about. But as the image sharpens schoolchildren are at play in of all places a cemetery. The setting is the isolated village of Wakely on the coast of England.American mathematician David Sumner (Dustin Hoffman) is walking along a road while his newly acquired wife and one-time resident Amy Sumner (Susan George) is parading braless and carrying a rather nasty-looking device called a 'mantrap'. David is introduced by Amy to Charlie Venner (Del Henney) an intense young man who is also an ex-lover of David's wife. David also meets two of Charlie's cousins named Janice Hedden (Sally Thomsett) and Bobby (Len Jones) her young brother.As Janice and Bobby are putting the mantrap in the back of the car David explains that he came to Wakely on sabbatical to write a treatise on celestial navigation. To ensure the peace and quiet needed to complete his book David agrees to hire Charlie and a mate to help several workmen make repairs on his new home.David enters the local pub where he meets gruff bartender Harry Ware (Robert Keegan) and apologetically asks for any brand of American cigarettes they might have. As David makes way in the pub Charlie discusses with Amy the possibility that she led him on in the old days with her taunting advances and was ""begging for it"". Amy humiliated retorts by spurning him. This is witnessed by David in the pub.In the pub David sees Janice's father and town patriarch Tom Hedden (Peter Vaughan) falling into an argument with Harry over a pint. Charlie tries to calm down his uncle. A fight ensues. A repentant Tom makes amends by paying for the American's cigarettes. But David turns down Tom's offer and exits the pub.David and Amy are driving to their new cottage. They meet Norman Scutt (Ken Hutchison) who's busy fixing up their garage. While there they also meet Chris Cawsey (Jim Norton) a giggling bloke who specializes in ridding the garage of rats. Chris and Norman are aware of the social turmoil and escalating violence of Vietnam-era American society and that David somehow retreated to Wakely to escape his country's violence. They begin to challenge David proving him to be spineless.At home David becomes intensely preoccupied with his research. He is verbally abusive to Amy and her cat who's often missing. This angers his wife. At one point she defaces his blackboard and changes his mathematical equations. David responds by saying ""what is this grammar school? Jesus Christ"".Meanwhile David is helping his wife prepare for dinner when he sees Norman and Chris receiving a lift from friend and lorry driver Phil Riddaway (Donald Webster) a hulking presence who serves to round out the potentially menacing gang making life unpleasant for David.Norman Chris and Phil meet at the pub with Tom and company where Tom begins to suspect pedophile and one-time podiatrist Henry Niles (David Warner) of molesting young girls including his own Janice. Tom insists that Henry's brother John (Peter Arne) ""keep a close watch on him"".David and Amy are getting ready for bed. The voyeuristic Janice spies on them. After a long night of lecturing and cheating antics they retire for the night.On the next day Amy becomes increasingly incensed by David's neglectful ways. She soon finds herself being ogled at by the men working on her house (Charlie Norman and Chris). She complains of this to David who suggests she ""wear a bra"". David continues to denote he left his country on a ""grant to study"". ""You left because you didn't want to take a stand. Commit!"" says Amy. David finalizes the argument by saying ""we came here because you once told me that we could be happier"". Frustrated Amy parades topless in front of the workers outside.The following day begins when Amy exclaims that her cat is missing. A frustrated David leaves the house only to find himself terrorized by the workmen in Phil's lorry. On their way to the pub they siphon their raging jealousy and contempt for the American academic by attempting to run his vehicle off the road.Outside the pub David notices Janice getting too close to Henry. He becomes flabbergasted by John's violent treatment towards his brother as well as Bobby's caveman-like attitude towards his sister.David enters the pub surrounded by his tormentors who persist in jeering at him. There he meets local one-armed magistrate John Scott (T.P. McKenna) who informs of David's invitation to a church social the coming Thursday and accompanies him to the house where he meets Reverend Barny Hood (Colin Welland) and his wife.Back in the house David is introduced to Barny and his wife. The fatuous vicar is in awe of David's research and his study of ""possible structures interiors...radiation"". David calls himself an ""astro-mathematician"". He goes on to assess the importance of his scientific findings and the impact of religion on the mounting violence and bloodshed inherent in all present societies. It is learned that David came to Wakely mainly to escape the violence which has become a part of everyday life.Later that night Amy's cat is found hanging in the closet. ""To prove to you that they can get into your bedroom"" in her estimation. Amy suspects Norman or Chris of killing her cat while David states ""it could've been anybody passing"".David is reluctant to confront the workers over Amy's cat. Instead by having Charlie Norman and Chris set up the mantrap over by the fireplace he agrees to go out hunting with them.David accompanies Charlie Norman Chris and Phil to the moors on a British version of ""snipe hunt"" where they keep him busy holding a sack open for the birds he believes will run into it. They spread about.While David is gone Amy is visited by Charlie who has been seething with lust over her. Amy feels Charlie has some knowledge regarding her slain cat but he promptly tries to seduce her. When she refuses he forces himself on her. In the process Norman eventually shows up at the house and threatens Charlie at gunpoint. Norman gleefully rapes Amy as well while Charlie begrudgingly assists his friend in holding her down.Amy doesn't tell David what happened. David tries to solve the problems in their marriage by ""going back to the basics"". He fires the four workers the next day. They ""stuck it"" to him on the moors he explains.In a moment of dis-consolation he sits in the field staring at an indeterminate distance.Some time later the couple attend the local church function where the vicar Barny displays his penchant for magic tricks while the audience enjoys the show. Amy haunted by memories of the rape has a breakdown. As the show progresses Janice approaches Henry. They leave the church and walk along the yard as seen by Bobby. Bobby tells his father Tom. The enraged Tom orders Bobby and John to find them. During this time David and Amy have left the church as well. Tom Charlie Norman Chris and Phil visit the pub to learn of Henry's whereabouts. David driving home in the dense fog rescues Henry. Unbeknownst to David Henry has just strangled Janice who was taunting him.Amy aware of Henry's pedophilic tendencies doesn't want Henry in the house. David tries to call the magistrate at the pub and informs Harry the bartender of Henry. Tom and his four young allies learn of Henry's whereabouts and go to the house to do violence to Henry.Since they ""know the American"" Charlie Norman and Chris ask for Tom and Phil to wait outside the house so they can find out where Janice is. David suddenly finds himself accosted by his three previous tormentors two of whom raped Amy. David prevents them from hurting Henry but Charlie says ""We've come to get this bloody freak...With your cooperation or without it"". As Henry proves unresponsive to their questioning Charlie Norman and Chris agree to look for Janice until the doctor and police arrive.Enraged by the lack of knowledge of his missing daughter Tom attempts to open the ""solid"" door while his cronies start blasting David's windows. One of them Charlie yells ""Look you stupid yank. Let's have Niles before someone gets hurt."" David hides Henry in the lavvy.As the men lay siege to the house what David says to Amy is key to understanding the situation. ""This is where I live. This is me. I will not allow violence against this house."" Moments later the magistrate arrives to calm Tom and the others down but gets killed in the process. As accessories to a drunk who shot the sheriff the men all decide to enter the house to get at Henry. Amy protests that David send Henry out but he tries to keep them out of the house. He turns off the lights.David uses every means and skill he knows to fight them off. He boils whiskey and even opens the mantrap. Amy tries to leave but David stops her. Realizing that ""they've gone too far to back down""
David suggests Amy be cooperative if they are to survive the night. Using such household items as a poker and wire he succeeds at keeping the men out of the house at every turn.As the relentless mob invade the house David plays bagpipe music and decides to strike back. He squibs Tom's feet with gunfire. Tom later dies from his wounds. Phil climbs up the window threatening to kill David. David dispatches him with a poker. Shortly thereafter he turns on his living room light to find the knife-wielding Chris is inside the house. He beats the man to death with a poker. As Charlie prepares to shoot David he is alarmed by Amy's screaming in her bedroom upstairs. Norman is trying to rape her. Charlie shoots him and then finds himself fighting with David. David kills Charlie when he hits him over the head with the mantrap.David is slightly taken aback by the carnage. ""Jesus. I got 'em all"" David exclaims. A seriously wounded Phil appears out of nowhere and wrestles David to the stairs. Completely exhausted David orders Amy to get the gun. She gets the shotgun and shoots the thug dead. There's no simple way back from the violence into which David has wandered.After the bloodbath Amy stays in the house while David leaves with Henry. Henry complains ""I don't know my way home"" David replies ""That's okay. I don't either."""

Senators judges assistant district attorneys and successful doctors.His wife Carol Flemming (Nina Foch) brings out the cake and just as the party's getting started - Dr. Ray Flemming (Gene Barry) is called away ostensibly to respond to patient having an anxiety attack.Dispite wife Carol's angry protests - Ray leaves kissing her on the cheek.However when Ray arrives at the West LA apartment - his ""patient"" is his sexy young mistress - an unknown bitpart actress named Joan Hudson (Katherine Justice). Jumping out of the swimming pool she greets him in a string bikini wrapping her arms & legs around him as she giggles.When Dr. Flemming returns home his wife Carol tells him that she's fed up with his ""extracurricular activities"" that she wants a divorce and that she will ruin him financially.To calm Carol's fury - Ray says that he's been preparing a second honeymoon in Acapulco Mexico. Carol is overjoyed now. As they prepare their luggage and are about to leave Ray kills Carol in his apartment.He breaks a window staging it to look like she was killed during a burglary. Joan arrives and disguises herself as Carol Flemming for their trip to the airport.Once they've boarded the plane the couple stages an argument so his mistress (still disguised as Carol Flemming) can return to the Flemmings' luxurious condo where she leaves Carol's dress in the laundry bag outside their door.Meanwhile in Acapulco - Ray Flemming has a wonderful time on his own fishing and chilling out with the locals. While on one of his many fishing trips Dr. Flemming throws the two heavy candle-holders and the ""stolen property"" into the ocean and a box with compromising objects.Dr. Flemming returns home where's he's greeted by Lt. Columbo (Peter Falk) who walks out of Flemming's master bedroom. Columbo takes out his notebook and begins his inquest by asking Ray Flemming if he can borrow a pen.Columbo tells him that Carol is at hospital in a coma. At that moment Joan phones trying to tell Ray that Carol is in a coma but alive. Ray blows off the call but Columbo smells something fishy.Ray goes to Foundation Hospital to see Carol but the doctors and the main nurse (Ena Hartman) will not allow it.The hospital administrator is a personal friend of Flemming's and grants access. But when Flemming & Columbo approach the door to his wife's room - they're blocked by a uniformed LAPD officer. As the cop explains why they cannot enter - the doctor emerges announcing Carol has died.Ray tries to keep appearances up especially with his closest friend Burt Gordon (William Windom) a prominent district attorney. Burt promises that he'll ask somebody important to take Columbo off his back but the lieutenant will only find this more reasuring telling him that if somebody is getting nervous that's only because he's on the right track. Nervous Joan cannot wait to meet Ray.Suddenly Columbo tells Dr. Flemming that the culprit has confessed. An oddly behaving military veteran ""Tommy"" (Anthony James) confesses that he broke in and killed Carol Flemming as he didn't expect anybody home. Ray says that he doesn't believe Tommy's confession: he must be a weirdo who gave false confession for any number of reasons; as Dr. Flemming says - ""maybe he's crazy maybe he just wants his name in the paper"".Joan Hudson has found a good acting job but can only see her lover sparingly posing as a patient. Columbo visits her on the studio. She doesn't want to answer his questions and asks for a legal counsellor. Columbo says he knows she was an accomplice to the crime and that he will follow her everywhere until she breaks down and confesses. She tries to look self-assured but is very nervous.Soon afterwards Dr. Flemming is told that Joan Hudson has commited suicide. When he goes to see the dead body at the swimming-pool he sees a red-headed woman (presumably Joan Hudson) wearing the familiar green bikini she wore at the beginning of the film.Columbo presses him again but Dr. Flemming tells him that this is no proof of Flemming's culpability. Flemming tells Columbo that he thought that Joan was dumb and that he didn't love her at all but she was ""available"" so he took the opportunity of using her. To his surprise - the real Joan Hudson (alive and well) hears him enters the room heart-broken and tells Columbo that she is going to confess.

"Detective Superintendent (Commissaire Principal) Pierre Niemans (Jean Reno) an investigator well known in Paris is sent to the small rural university town of Guernon in the French Alps to investigate a brutal murder. The victim's body is found bound in the fetal position and suspended high on a cliff face his eyes removed and his hands cut off. Niemans learns that the victim was a professor and the University's librarian Remy Callois and he seeks out a local ophthalmologist for an explanation to the removal of the eyes. Dr. Cherneze once on the University staff explains that the school's isolation led to in-breeding amongst the professors with increasingly serious genetic disorders. Recently the trend has reversed with the local village children becoming ill and the college babies remaining healthy. Cherneze hints that the killer is leaving Niemans clues to their motive by removing the body parts that are unique to each individual - the eyes and hands. Niemans questions the Dean and examines the librarian's apartment where he finds images of athletic ""supermen"" juxtaposed with texts on genetic deformities. The Dean's assistant (and son) Hubert translates the title of Callois' Ph.D. thesis as ""We are the masters. We are the slaves. We are everywhere. We are nowhere. We control the crimson rivers.""Coincidentally Detective Inspector (Lieutenant de Police) Max Kerkerian (Vincent Cassel) is in the nearby town of Sarzac investigating the desecration of the grave of Judith Herault a girl who died in 1982 and the theft of her photos from the local primary school. The girl was killed in a horrific highway accident witnessed by her mother who was so traumatized she took a vow of darkness in a nunnery. The mother tells Kerkerian that when Judith was ten she fell ill and they went to get help in Guernon where she was born; she claims they were then attacked by ""demons"" and when they fled her daughter was killed in the road accident. She says the pictures were stolen to erase her daughter from history and that her face is a threat to the demons who have returned to complete their mission. She tells him it all began in Guernon.Niemans questions Fanny Ferreira (Nadia Farès) a glaciologist and student who is immediately suspect because of her climbing ability. Despite her contempt for the school and its arrogant professors she works for the university to steer away frequent avalanches and is incensed when Niemans implies she might withhold evidence to protect the school. She tells him that anyone with good equipment could've hoisted the body up the cliff and brushes off his obvious attraction. Soon after the pathologist reports that it was acid rain in Callois' eye sockets which has not fallen in the area since the seventies. Niemans enlists Fanny to take him up the glacier to get ice samples to compare with the acid rain in Callois' eyes. On a hunch Niemans follows a glacial melt tunnel to a cave that contains a second body frozen into the ice.Kerkerian traces a car from the accident to Phillip Sertys in Guernon and meets Niemans while attempting to break into Sertys' apartment. Sertys is the body in the ice a doctor that worked in the maternity ward at the University hospital. They find Judith's stolen photograph as well as evidence that Sertys was breeding and training fighting dogs - and then they find the dogs and Niemans the ""supercop"" is momentarily paralyzed by fear until Kerkerian coaxes him through.Sertys was also mutilated and his eyes replaced with glass prosthetics ""Like you would find at an eye doctor's"" remarks the pathologist leading Niemans to race back to Cherneze's practice. The doctor is already dead and they almost catch the killer who fights off Niemans and races away after deliberately emptying Niemans' gun into the wall but not hitting him. Kerkerian gives chase but the killer escapes. Returning to the scene where the killer has written ""I will trace the source of the crimson rivers"" in Cherneze's own blood above his body they learn the prints on Niemans' gun belong to Judith Herault.Kerkerian goes back to search the grave in Sarzac which is empty except for a picture while Niemans goes to Fanny's home. Niemans tells her that although he sees her as physically capable of committing the crimes he doesn't believe her to be guilty. When he returns to the university the local police captain tells him that Callois' thesis is full of Nazi-style eugenics suggesting perfection can be achieved by breeding athletically gifted and intellectually gifted children together.Kerkerian returns with the photo which Niemans recognizes as Fanny and on the way to her house they narrowly avoid being run off the road by the Dean's son as they piece together the story. Due to the poor bloodlines and genetic mutations in the faculty's inbred offspring the doctors at the hospital had been swapping healthy village children with the university children. Sertys they deduce must have swapped Fanny for Judith and Callois arranged the matches in the college's breeding program. Once at Fanny's house they find the missing hands and eyes of the victims in her basement but Fanny is now gone and so are her grenades. Niemans gives the order to evacuate the university while he and Kerkerian travel up the mountain to find Fanny.The duo confront Fanny only to be set upon by Judith who is her identical twin. Judith tells Fanny to kill Niemans she refuses and instead turns the gun on her sister. At the same time Kerkerian fires at Judith but hits Fanny in the shoulder and the gunshots trigger an avalanche. Judith is swept away and the rest are buried in the snow until a rescue team arrives with search dogs. Fanny is airlifted to hospital while Kerkerian asks Niemans to explain his fear of dogs."

"A haunted New York City detective must delve into his dark past in order to stop a serial killer whose highly artistic modus operandi seems uncannily similar to that of a madman who stalked the city streets five years prior. When reclusive detective Stan Aubray (Willem Dafoe) gunned down the man suspected of being the ""Uncle Eddie"" murderer he thought his nightmare had come to an end. But now a new crop of victims has begun to turn up each bearing the distinctive mark of the maniac whom everyone had presumed to be dead. Much like the unfortunate victims of ""Uncle Eddie"" the bodies in this latest batch have been carefully arranged in a manner that reflects the artistic style known as anamorphosis -- where hidden meanings can be revealed by viewing the crime scenes from different perspectives. Could this be the work of a copycat killer or is it possible that Detective Aubray and his men killed the wrong man on that fateful day five years ago? All signs indicate that the latest killings were carried out with Detective Aubray specifically in mind prompting him to reexamine the painful questions that he had struggled all these years to suppress. On one side Detective Aubray faces the scrutiny of a bright young detective (Scott Speedman) who has his own unique ideas about the killings and on the other a disturbed young woman (Clea Duvall) who proves a dangerous link to Detective Aubray's mystery-shrouded past. Only by confronting the possibility that he fears most will Detective Aubray finally be able to overcome his own stifling sense of guilt and finally uncover the truth about the most gruesome crimes ever committed in New York City."

"Wilson (Terence Stamp) snarls to a black screen ""Tell me. Tell me. Tell me about Jenny."" cuing the Who's song ""The Seeker to play as we get our first look at Wilson an aged but determined looking man who makes his way from the airport to a hotel room. He looks at a newspaper clipping about a woman's death and at a California address for an ""Ed Roel"" written on an envelope. He quickly finds Ed Roel (Luis Guzman)We then see Wilson flashing between a car an airplane and his room thinking about a little girl. We resume the scene meeting Ed Roel and Wilson introduces himself reminding Ed that he had written to Wilson about his daughter. Ed realizes who Wilson is and invites him into the house. Ed makes some food but Wilson isn't interested in small talk. He asks Ed ""Who done it then snuffed her?"" Ed tells him he never said anyone ""snuffed her."" just sent the newspaper clipping. He tells Wilson that there was an investigation into the accident and his daughter's neck was broken on impact ""so she wouldn't have felt the effects of the fire."" Ed drives Wilson around and rationalizes that an accident could happen to anybody. Wilson replies ""No. Not my girl. Self control she had. It was a point of pride."" Wilson pushes Ed for information on where Jenny bought her ""grass or whatever."" Ed claims he doesn't know anything about that and Wilson mentions his tattoos. Ed explains that he did five years in prison but he's done with that. Wilson surprises him by saying ""I just got out meself didn't I."" Wilson changes the conversation asking ""Terry Valentine this bloke she was bunked up with what's he got to say for himself?"" Ed has no idea about Terry Valentine.We see Wilson buying a pistol from a couple of kids the scene flashing back to previous scenes of the hotel the airplane driving and talking at Ed's house. Ed recalls driving Jenny downtown to look for Terry Valentine. He assumed she was looking to catch him with another girl but was surprised she didn't want to check hotels but asked him to bring her to ""some bad place."" where there was shipping going on and men unloading trucks. Valentine wasn't there but Ed says ""Jenny stood right in front of those guys eyeballing them checking them out. She made me feel like she was covering my ass."" We see Wilson alone finding the place Ed referred to. Wilson cuts through the wire fence (remarkably easily) enter the property and walks into the building asking the first man he sees at a desk if he knows Terry Valentine. When the man doesn't tell him anything Wilson starts beating the man before several more men show up to pull him away. The man at the desk wants to know who Wilson is and when he mentions Jennifer Wilson one of the other men asks if she was the girl that came down there one time. The man admits that Terry Valentine is a personal friend and says he doesn't discuss his friends with anybody. He tells Wilson that Jennifer had come by asking who he was and how he knew Terry and the nature of their business. He then whispers to Wilson what he would've liked to do to Jenny Wilson can't contain himself and strikes the man in the groin prompting quick retaliation as the other men ensure Wilson can't respond. They escort Wilson out of the office taking turns kicking him and throwing him into things on the way out. They throw him onto the pavement and tell him if he comes back they'll kill him. Wilson gets up and pulls a gun tucked in the back of his pants. He walks right back into the building and there is yelling and several shots. One of the men runs away and Wilson yells after him ""You tell him. You tell him I'm coming. Tell him I'm fucking coming!""At a huge Mansion overlooking the hills and ocean. Terry Valentine (Peter Fonda) the owner watches a 20-ish girl swimming and talks about her name Adhara (Amelia Heinle) remembering that he had suggested using a constellation to her parents before they named her. He asks if she needs anything. She asks why he keeps ""the scary man"" in his house to which he says ""Gordon? He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks.""Jim Avery (Barry Newman) watches from overheard and yells to Terry that he has news. He tells Terry ""Our friends downtown someone took them out."" They wonder if it was a gang killing but Avery says it was a lone gunman. They mention Jenny.Ed tells Wilson that Terry Valentine was a ""money guy."" and that Jenny had been with him for five years. He remarks that Jenny had introduced him to Terry but Terry ""didn't even see him."" and that they lived in different social circles and that he'd met Jenny in his acting class.Wilson finds Elaine (Lesley Ann Warren) a friend of Jenny's who tells him ""She was twenty one when she came to me straight from leaving you."" Elaine helped Jenny get rid of her English accent. She knows Wilson had been in jail and tells him Valentine is a rock concert promoter.Ed goes along as Wilson scopes out Terry's place with binoculars. They realize Terry's having a party when they see a lot of valets. The two go over to pretend being guests Wilson tells him ""I'm gonna have a butcher's round the house."" Ed seems concerned not realizing this is rhyming slang. He asks ""Who you gonna butcher?"" Wilson says ""Butcher's hook look."" and then heads upstairs to look around. He sees a picture in the hall and remembers Jenny as a little girl. Terry joins the party and talks with guests as Wilson checks out his bedroom hiding when Adhara has to get out of the master bathroom tub to get the phone. Wilson goes downstairs and finds Ed standing by the pool. Wilson realizes the pool is built to extend out into the air with a long drop outside the railing. He imagines shooting Terry at several different ranges nearly walking right up to him before Ed pulls him back outside. Terry notices the way Wilson looked at him and Avery sends a man out to remove Wilson who has sent Ed to grab the car. Wilson tosses the security man over the railing catching the party's attention. Everyone rushes to look over the side. Avery attempts to grab Ed who is waiting with the car but Wilson throws him out of the way and they drive off. Ed tells Wilson he thought he was going to cap the guy but Wilson insists that ""he's gotta know why."" Avery follows them hitting their car and then firing a shotgun at them. Wilson forces Ed to hit Reverse and nearly hits Avery knocking his car down a ravine.Avery returns to the house and meets with Terry and scolds him for talking to the police without him. Terry told made up a story that a longtime employee with drug problems flipped out and committed suicide. Avery reveals that Jenny's father just got out of prison for armed robbery ""again."" which gets Terry flustered. Terry insists that he can't take care of Wilson using his own security as it could be connected to him. Avery assures him that he has ""other resources.""We then find some guys arguing over a break at a pool hall. One of the guys Stacy (Nicky Katt) beats another guy with a cue as Avery walks in and calls him over. Avery asks ""How would you like to kill someone for me."" Stacy says ""Ok."" Stacy is upset that he's supposed to find actually Wilson telling Avery. ""I just do it. I don't organize it."" Stacy tells a dimwitted friend he's getting paid $5000.00 for the hit. Stacy and his friend find Elaine at a film shoot and Wilson shows up to see her. They follow them to a hotel garage and just before Stacy moves in for the hit he is stopped by men in suits who tells Wilson to go with them. They bring Wilson and Elaine to another location. Left alone for a moment Wilson shows a DEA badge he pickpocketed and tells Elaine that he watched Jenny grow up ""in increments."" He remembers Jenny used to threaten him ""If you're naughty Dad I'll put the law on you. I promise. He recalls her in flashback as a little girl picking up the phone threatening to ""shop him."" Elaine says ""She never would have turned you in not in a million years.""The lead DEA agent meets with him and Wilson tells him he doesn't care what Valentine's mixed up in. He then tells him a story about him wanting revenge on a prison guard then easing off when he had a chance. Wilson tells him that they're likely after the same thing for different reasons. He tells the agent he's not after money but something else. The DEA man tells his own story of rich men getting involved in drug trade they suspect heroin dealers are using Valentine to launder the money. The agent then ""accidentally"" drops a file showing a Big Sur address for Valentine and releases Wilson.Terry Valentine is driving with Adhara to the other house. She realizes that the black SUV behind them has been following them and Terry says ""I sure hope so."" as Avery and two heavies are following. Ed Elaine and Wilson drive to the other house as well. Back at the pool hall Stacy grumbles that he knows Avery is up at Big Sur he wants to go there and the big stash of money or drugs.At the ocean side house Adhara complains that Terry hasn't told her anything about the situation. He tells her that she wouldn't know anything about having enemies. Elaine tells Wilson that Jenny ""lived"" at the beach and loved the ocean causing him to remember her at the beach as a girl. He remarks ""She was from an island.""The security watches all around the property as Avery and Terry watch TV Adhara showers upstairs. Everyone pays attention when a car alarm goes off and some guards go check for it. When it shuts off Terry realizes that a guard who was on the porch is missing. We see Wilson tying the man up gagged in the yard. Avery gets Adhara and moves everybody to the living room hiding behind the couch. Avery shoots at a figure in the window and going to check he finds it was Stacy. Avery is then shot by Stacy's friend who also shoots another guard before The wounded Avery shoots him while lying on the ground. Wilson then grabs Terry as he's going for the door and fights with him in the house. Adhara stabs Wilson with a skewer but is knocked out Valentine escapes and grabs Avery's gun leaving the injured man without a word. Wilson is slowed but follows Terry down the stairs to the rocky beach. Terry shoots at Wilson but misses. He then twists his ankle and falls and Wilson catches him.

"IntroductionMickey Knox and his wife Mallory go to a roadside café in the New Mexico desert. They appear to be normal customers with Mickey eating key lime pie and Mallory dancing to rock 'n' roll on the jukebox. A group of rednecks arrive and one begins dancing and flirting with Mallory. She encourages him for a moment then attacks him without provocation by smashing his beer bottle as he drinks from it. A fistfight ensues with Mallory beating the man. When the redneck's friend intervenes Mickey cuts off one of the cowboy's fingers and stabs him with a large Bowie-style knife. Mickey and Mallory then begin killing the diner's patrons culminating in a morbid game of ""Eeny meeny miny moe"" to decide who lives and who dies among the last 2 customers. After executing their final victim Mabel the waitress the couple make sure the only survivor a cook remembers their names and promises to tell the authorities who committed the massacre before they embrace and declare their undying love for each other.Part IMickey and Mallory are in a desert at night. Mallory is reminiscing about when they first met. A flashback shows Mickey as a butcher's deliveryman who came to the house where Mallory lived with her abusive father (Rodney Dangerfield) her neglectful mother (Edie McClurg) and her younger brother Kevin. The flashback is portrayed as a 1950s-type sitcom with a canned laughter track the ""audience"" laughing hardest when Mallory is subjected to lewd comments and hints of molestation by her father.Mickey instantly falls in love with Mallory. They leave together Mickey stealing Mallory's father's car. Mickey is arrested and imprisoned for grand theft auto but he subsequently escapes a horse work farm during a tornado and returns to Mallory's house. The two kill her father by beating him with a jack handle and drowning him in a fish tank then burn her mother alive in bed. They spare her ten-year-old brother Mallory telling him that he is free. They leave to rapturous applause from the ""audience.""Mickey and Mallory get ""married"" on the side of a bridge exchanging snake wedding bands cutting their palms and mixing their blood which drips down into the river below. They drive to a motel for the night. After watching television they begin to have sex until Mickey is distracted by a female hostage. Furious with Mickey's notion that they have a threesome Mallory drives to a nearby gas station where she flirts with the mechanic. They begin to have sex on the hood of a car but Mallory is angered by his over-aggressive oral sex and shoots him to death. Back at the motel Mickey rapes the hostage.Part IIThe pair continue their killing-spree (which bears similarities to Bonnie and Clyde and the Starkweather-Fugate murders) ultimately claiming 48 victims along Route 666 in New Mexico Colorado and Utah. Pursuing them are two characters who see the murderers as a chance to achieve fame for themselves.The first is a policeman Detective Jack Scagnetti who seems particularly fascinated by Mallory. Scagnetti is already a well-known personality a published author whose book ""Scagnetti on Scagnetti"" is a best-seller within law enforcement. Scagnetti has a lifelong obsession with mass murderers after witnessing his mother being shot and killed by Charles Whitman in Austin Texas when he was eight. Despite his heroic facade he is actually sociopathic strangling a prostitute to death in a hotel room after he tries to get too rough with her & she scratches his face.The second follower of the killers is journalist Wayne Gale an Australian who hosts a show called American Maniacs which profiles mass murderers. Various clips of Mickey and Mallory are shown with Gale acting outraged on-screen as he details the pair's crimes although off-air he clearly regards them as a fantastic way of increasing his show's ratings. It is Gale who is primarily responsible for elevating Mickey and Mallory to hero status with his show featuring interviews with people around the world expressing their admiration for the killers.Mickey and Mallory become lost in the desert and encounter Warren Red Cloud a Navajo Indian and his pre-adolescent grandson. After the two fall asleep the Navajo hoping to expel the demon he perceives in Mickey begins chanting beside the fire invoking nightmares in Mickey about his abusive parents. Mickey wakes up in a rage and fatally shoots the Navajo before he realizes what he is doing. It is the first time Mallory and Mickey feel guilty for a murder. While fleeing from the scene through the desert they stray into a field of rattlesnakes and are both bitten.They drive to a drugstore to find snake antivenin but the pharmacist sets off the silent alarm before Mickey kills him. Police cars pull up. Mallory is captured immediately and is subsequently beaten by the sadistic and brutish police. A gunfight breaks out between Mickey and the others. When Scagnetti arrives he tells Mickey that unless he surrenders he'll cut off Mallory's breasts slashing her a few times with his knife. Mickey gives up his gun but he attacks Scagnetti with a knife. The police use tazers on him and the scene ends with Mickey and Mallory being beaten by a group of vengeful policemen while Scagnetti excitedly looks on.Part IIIThe story picks up one year later. The homicidal couple have been imprisoned -- a trial is only hinted at in footage provided by Gale. The two have killed several people in prison including inmates and guards. Mallory herself has murdered her psychiatrist. Both are due to be moved to a mental hospital after being declared insane. Scagnetti arrives at the prison and encounters Dwight McClusky the sleazy and abusive warden of the prison. The two devise a plan to murder the two criminals: McClusky will arrange for Scagnetti to be the driver for the Knox's transfer. Alone with the pair Scagnetti will kill them claiming they tried to escape.Wayne Gale has persuaded Mickey to agree to a live interview to air immediately after the Super Bowl. Mallory is held in solitary confinement elsewhere in the prison awaiting her transport to the mental hospital.During the interview Mickey gives a speech about how murder provides enlightenment and declares himself a ""natural born killer."" His words inspire the other inmates (who are watching the interview on TV in the recreation room) and incite them to riot.When word of the riot reaches McClusky he orders the interview terminated over Gale's violent protests. Mickey is left alone with Gale the TV crew and several guards. Using a lengthy joke as a diversion Mickey overpowers a guard and grabs his shotgun and kills most of the guards and some of Gale's crew. Mickey takes the survivors hostage leading them through the prison riot intending to reunite with Mallory. Gale follows excitedly giving a live television report as people are beaten and killed around him. Inmates torture and murder prisoners and guards alike.During the interview and outbreak of the riot Scagnetti is in Mallory's cell attempting to seduce her. Mallory plays along for a short time then attacks Scagnetti violently smashing his face against the wall and breaking his nose. The guards and Scagnetti subdue her.Still live on national television Mickey bursts into Mallory's cell and engages in a brief Mexican standoff with Scagnetti eventually feigning a concession. Mallory then approaches Scagnetti from behind and slashes his throat with a shank. Mickey then reveals that the shotgun was unloaded much to Scagnetti's horror. Mallory picks up Scagnetti's loaded gun and kills him.They continue to escape through the riot-torn prison with two guards as hostages. The remainder of Gale's TV crew are killed. Gale himself snaps and begins to shoot at the guards claiming to be ""alive for the first time in [his] life.""After being rescued by a mysterious prisoner named Owen Traft the trio of Mickey Mallory and Gale run into Warden McClusky and a heavily armed posse of guards. Cavanaugh the guard they'd taken hostage is shot to death by McClusky's men. In retaliation Mallory shoots Gale thru his hand & they retreat taking cover in a blood-splattered shower room. Gale calls his wife and tells her he is leaving her. He calls his mistress to tell her he will see her later however she hangs up on him.McClusky threatens to storm the shower room. Mickey in turn duct-tapes shotguns to the necks of Gale & a guard Homolka threatening to kill both on live TV. The prisoners walk out the front door. McClusky and his guards are massacred by hordes of inmates who burst into the area. They tear McClusky apart cutting his head off and displaying it on a spike (a shot removed from the theatrical showing and seen in the director's cut only).After the escape Owen is never seen or mentioned again. Mickey and Mallory steal a van and kill the last guard. Escaping to a rural location they give a final interview to Wayne Gale before much to his surprise and horror they tell him he must also die. Gale futilely attempts to change their minds finally appealing to their trademark practice of leaving one witness to tell the tale. Mickey inform hims they are leaving his camera as the witness. Gale accepts his fate and extends his arms as if crucified as they shoot him numerous times while his unattended camera continues to roll.The couple are shown several years later in an RV with Mickey driving and Mallory (who is pregnant) watching their two children play."

"The movie begins at present day with Saket Ram (Kamal Hassan) an 89-year-old South Indian Brahmin who is dying. The scene reverts to the past as Saket remembers the 1940s when he and his good friend were archaeologists working together under their boss Mortimer Wheeler in Mohenjo-daro (Indus Valley Civilization) in Karachi. Relations are pleasant between the Indians and the English and Saket and Amjad do not approve of Partition and the creation of Pakistan.Aparna Ram (Rani Mukerji) Saket's simple Bengali wife is a school teacher. She lives in Calcutta in the midst of riots and chaos over the issue of the formation of Pakistan and the call by Mohammad Ali Jinnah for ""Direct Action"". Saket goes to Calcutta and is swept into the madness. In one instance Saket saves an innocent Sikh girl from the hands of a barbaric Muslim gang. When he returns to his house he finds a group of Muslims entering his house. They brutally rape and murder Aparna. Saket unable to cope with his tragic loss kills the Muslims who raped and killed his wife in a fit of rage.Outside his house he runs into another Brahmin Sriram Abhyankar (Atul Kulkarni) who is part of a Hindu militant group determined to fight the Muslims' malice with similar brute force and assassinate Gandhi for what they perceive to be his treachery towards Hindu dominated India (Gandhi wanted Hindus and Muslims to co-exist peacefully with hope of winning over the hearts of the rioters through sheer self-pity). However Abhyankar and his fellow extremists had lost patience at what they deemed Mahatma Gandhi's unreasonable stand to appease Pakistan who had already invaded Kashmir by that time. Gandhi was pressurizing the newly founded Indian state to pay Rs. 62 Crore to Pakistan and some territorial concessions as well.Urged by family to remarry he weds Mythili (Vasundhara Das). However on a trip to Maharashtra he reunites with Abhyankar and becomes a part of his militant organisation that plots to do away with Gandhi. Due to an horse-riding accident Abhyankar is left a quadriplegic and has Ram swear that he will carry on his work that of killing the Mahatma.Saket comes to the belief that Mahatma Gandhi (Naseeruddin Shah) is solely responsible for the division of India and of the two religions and also of having supported whom they viewed as the enemy. Hindu fundamentalists including Saket are furious and plot to murder Gandhi. However Saket after several incidents surrounding and leading to Amjad's death (with whom he reunites briefly in a congested Delhi area) changes his mind about Gandhi. He decides against assassinating the leader and attempts to beg for forgiveness. Soon afterwards Gandhi is killed by another assassin Nathuram Godse. Ironically Gandhi dies without his famous last words: ""Hey Ram!"" as popularly believed and as in Richard Attenborough's film Gandhi (film).(Though actual witnesses have denied having heard Gandhi utter those famous last words.)Then on Saket Ram lives by Gandhian principles. As the 89-year-old Saket Ram is being taken to the hospital he is told of bomb blasts in the city due to Hindu-Muslim communal riots. He asks ""Innuma(even still)?"". They were forced by the police to be taken into an underground shelter for their security but Saket Ram dies there. in his funeral gandhis grandson come and see saket private room with full of historical photos. Saket's grandson handed over gandhis footwears and spectacles which Saket collected from place of shoot out and keep like inspirational treasure.Thanks to Wikipedia"
Saketh Ram's wife is raped and killed during direct action day riots in Calcutta. He is convinced that Mahatma Gandhi is responsible for all the problems happening in the country and sets out to kill him.::tsunami79
"The film starts with Saketh Ram as a very old man and almost immediately goes into flashback. As a young man he is among his friends in conviviality. He has taken a Bengali wife Aparna and everything is wonderful in his life However the year is 1946 and the imminent independence of India from British suzerainty is complicated by religious antagonism between the Hindu majority and the large Muslim minority who demand their own independent state. Saketh and Aparna visit Calcutta; rioting is reported but Saketh goes out to get some food and he soon encounters a Hindu woman being chased by Muslim rioters. He rescues her but the rioters later come to his house and brutally rape and then kill his wife. Saketh is devastated and takes to the streets determined personally to kill as many Muslims as he can find. He meets up with Sriram Abhiyankar who is leading a group of Hindu extremists and Saketh becomes temporarily taken with the cause himself. At the same time he is persuaded to take a new wife Mythili and life begins to stabilize for Saketh after all. However he then falls in with an eminent Maharajah who is leading an underground group with the intention of assassination. Travelling with the Maharajah Saketh meets one of his old friends from younger days who has fallen on hard times. Reminiscing and getting his old friend back on his feet deflect the process of recruiting Saketh but only temporarily and soon he is manipulated into committing himself to renouncing his family and his new wife in the interests of the cause which now is disclosed as the assassination of Gandhi. Although a fellow Hindu Gandhi was felt by some to be too conciliatory to Muslims and in the logic of extremists Gandhi became the prime target. Soon Saketh is informed that Gandhi will be in Delhi for some weeks and that Saketh is to take the opportunity to do ""his duty"". However hiding from a snap search by the police he has to hide his pistol on a delivery lorry and it is driven away to a factory owned by Muslims. Going there hoping to retrieve the gun he becomes engulfed in a shoot-out between some Hindu attackers and the Muslims and finds that his loyalties are not so clear cut as he had imagined. Finally he escapes after the death of another of his old friends in the crossfire. The next day January 30th 1948 he contrives to be near Gandhi in a public prayer ground his appointment with destiny. But the film still has 20 minutes to run and the ending is not what you expect.::Hazel Freeman"
The movie begins at present day with Saketh Ram (Kamal Haasan) an 89-year-old South Indian Brahmin who is dying. The scene reverts back to the past as Saketh remembers the 1940's when he and his good friend Amjad Ali Khan (Shahrukh Khan) were archaeologists working together under their boss Mortimer Wheeler in Mohanjodaro (Indus River Valley Civilization) in Karachi. Relations are pleasant between the Indians and the English and Saket and Amjad do not approve of the Partition and the creation of Pakistan. Aparna Sen Saketh's simple Bengali wife is living in Calcutta in the midst of riots and chaos over the issue of the formation of Pakistan. Saket goes to Calcutta and is swept into the madness. In one instance Saket saves an innocent Punjabi girl from the hands of a Muslim gang. The Muslims are angered and decide to take revenge; the group is headed by Aparna's tailor Altaf who break into Saket's home. They brutally rape and maliciously slit Rani's throat and the scene so vividly shot leaves little for the imagination. This itself turns Saketh Ram maniacal and puts him on a wild killing spree avenging his wife's disgrace and killing every possible Muslim in sight. On his apparent sortie he comes across a bunch of right-winged Hindu fundamentalists led by Abhyankar (Atul Kulkarni). Abhyankar preaches him about the need of the Hindus to come together and save their brethren from the Islamists who according to them are mere intruders from across the Khyber.. He soon joins fanatical Hindus and loses sense of himself falling victim to the chaos and religious hatred around him. He is also urged to marry again and agrees to it reluctantly. Mahatma Gandhi (Naseeruddin Shah) is solely blamed for the division of India and of the two religions. His wrath gets the better of him as he pledges to take revenge co-opted by the Hindutva Brigade and he travels from Calcutta to Madras to kill Mahatma Gandhi. There he meets his second wife (Vasundhara Das)  another light eyed beauty. Saketh Ram does not love her but only marries her under his father's (Kavignar Vaali) orders. Saket Ram is entrusted the task of killing Mahatma Gandhi after his friend Abhyankar is left paralyzed in a freak accident. He has a change of heart only when he falls prey to a bunch of Muslims where he also meets old chum Amjad Khan (Shah Rukh Khan) an ardent Gandhi admirer. At the climax Saketh Ram is prepared to murder Mahatma Gandhi but is stopped by Amjad. He later realizes that without Gandhi India would be destroyed. He goes up to Gandhi and begs for forgiveness but Gandhi says he has to go and that he has no time for his apologies. When Gandhi is about to leave a young man approaches and kills Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi with a gun. The movie ends with the old Saketh Ram slowly dying on his death bed.::Hariharan
Saketh Ram comes from a wealthy and educated South Indian family and is currently touring Karachi British India in the company of his businessmen friends Lalwani and Amjad Ali Khan. Saketh goes to Calcutta to meet his beloved wife Aparna. Then religious riots break out and soon there are Sikh and Hindu gangs killing Muslims on sight while there are Muslim gangs who kill non-Muslims on sight as well as rape and molest their women. Unfortunately Aparna happens to be one of those women. Saketh is enraged first at the Muslims then at Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi for advocating peace with the Muslims and soon he becomes involved with a revolutionary group of right-wing Hindu from Maharashtra who want to assassinate Gandhi. The British leave a bitter and divided India and Saketh comes home where his family get him married to Mythili Iyengar. Subsequently both of them leave and re-locate to Maharashtra where they meet with Maharaja and are soon involved in plotting to assassinate Gandhi. Saketh Ram and Shriram Abhyankar are entrusted with this task however Shriram has an accident is paralyzed and subsequently dies leaving Saketh to complete the task of assassinating Mohandas who will later be known as Mahatma Gandhi.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)

"The movie opens with a shot of two people leaping from a bridge into the water below. The camera is panned out too far to determine anything about the two jumpers.Fade out and back in 24 hours earlier; in the apartment of Shawn Holloway (Selma Blair) a young woman whose life is going nowhere fast. We then see repeatedly shifting shots of Shawn hanging upside down from her window sill smoking two cigarettes simultaneously one in each hand; interspersed with Charlie Anders (Max Beesley) a young man playing a full set of drums.Shawn crawls back into her apartment and to her bed where her lover Matthew (D.W. Moffett) still sleeps. She brusquely awakens him only to promptly get an earful of laments as to how Matthew is going to explain his all-night absences to his wife as he hurriedly dresses.Shawn's relationship with Matthew is going nowhere either as he's too spineless to leave his wife. Looking gloomy she stomps into her bathroom and sits down grabbing a shaving razor and putting it to her wrist although she's barely able to nick it before she throws the razor aside and grabs another cigarette having to listen to Matthew drone on about how his wife cancelled a planned trip she was going to take forcing Matthew to have to back out of a planned trip to Tahoe he'd been planning with Shawn.After Matthew leaves a morose Shawn drowns her sorrows in more tobacco until it's time to shower and dress. But the emotional pressure continues to build until she screams in anger.
7:30 am: Charlie shaves as Shawn has finished dressing. The forecasted weather for the day matches Shawn's mood pretty nicely although she couldn't care less. And it's about to get worse for Shawn as she grabs her boots and spots her goldfish floating lifelessly in its fishbowl.Meanwhile Charlie is picked up for work by two car pool mates: Billy (Brendan Fehr) who's around his age and a much older man named Jason (Tom Heaton) who suffers from a prostate condition.Needing someone to comfort her Shawn calls her father Lyle (Marcel Maillard) only to find him so wrapped up in playing with a newborn daughter he's fathered with a new wife that he hardly has any time for her and barely pays attention. Shawn finally tells him that she's doing fine and hangs up. Grabbing a plastic trash bag she begins stuffing all of Matthew's things into it.9:15 am: Shawn is at work as a loan officer for a bank interviewing a married couple expecting their first baby who are applying for a home loan. The wife is delighted to hear that they qualify for the loan but Shawn launches into a droning pitch about how the eventual reimbursement requirements could leave the couple too cash-strapped to put their child through college or handle any of numerous other 'what-if' possibilities that can arise. The husband is summarily intimidated into wanting to rethink and consider further prompting the wife to angrily take her feelings out on Shawn.Shawn picks up the trash bag and goes to see her boss and the bank vice-president... Matthew. She tells him the affair is over as it's clear she can't compete with Matthew's wife and sharing him behind the wife's back is proving torturous. Matthew tries to plead for more time for things for the two of them to get back on track. But a surprise visit from Matthew's wife shoots this down rather permanently; Shawn sees that Matthew's wife is pregnant. She's expecting a baby with Matthew.Shawn sits at her desk her whole world crumbling around her as she tries to hold back tears. Grabbing a bottle of liquor from her desk drawer Shawn curls up on the bank building's roof smoking and drinking trying to blot out all her misery.An armored car pulls up to make a pickup from the bank as Shawn climbs up and teeters on the edge of the roof's railing. She's reached the end of the rope and is hoping to work up enough courage to commit suicide.Two men in ski masks and carrying guns jump the armored car pickup and demand the money being loaded aboard. A robbery starts to go down. One of them punches Matthew right in the nose as the armored car drives off.Across the street an office worker glances out his window and notices Shawn standing on the ledge working up her courage to jump. He grabs his phone and calls emergency services to report it.Police and firefighters arrive to stop Shawn's suicide. The robbers note the arrival and think police are already responding to the robbery. They retreat into the bank looking to run through it and escape.Billy sits in his car alone watching the police. Seeing them look up at the roof he follows their gaze and sees Shawn. Billy Charlie and Jay are the bank robbery crew and Shawn's intended suicide threatens to derail it.Shawn screams angrily at the cops that they can't stop her from killing herself. Just at that moment Charlie and Jay still masked and carrying the stolen money run through the bank proper. Jay runs out the front doors running right smack into police responders. He dashes for Billy's car but one of the cops shoots him in the buttocks. This scares Billy and he drives off in a real hurry leaving Charlie alone in the bank without his escape ride.Charlie panics and charges blindly into a set of stairs climbing as fast as he can while a pursuing cop shoots at him. With nowhere else to go but to continue up the stairs Charlie continues climbing. Oblivious to all this Shawn drinks from her bottle more and more quickly in hopes it will finally unsteady her balance enough to make her fall.The cop pursuing Charlie trips and bangs his shin on one of the steps breaking his pursuit. Unable to open a locked door back into the building proper Charlie continues running up the stairs.Shawn is finally ready to jump and begins leaning further and further forward to meet her maker. But Charlie bursts out onto the the roof and sees her. Grabbing her from behind he yanks her to safety and menaces her with his gun trying to sound frightening and threatening to shoot her if she doesn't cooperate. But Shawn eagerly yells at him to go ahead and shoot her; that it's the biggest favor he can do her right now. At first Charlie doesn't take her seriously and the pursuing police officer finally makes it to the roof and begins a stand-off with Charlie but he backs down when Charlie challenges the cop if he wants Shawn's death on his conscience.More police arrive including detectives McGinley (O'Neal Compton) and Reed (Lochlyn Munro). They find that the robbery was interrupted by a call on a woman looking to jump from the roof.Meanwhile Charlie is left with a hostage who wants to die and is ready to provoke him into shooting her. Cornered scared and only wanting to get away Charlie manages to make a half-witted bargain with Shawn; help him and he'll help her. If she acts as a hostage and helps Charlie get to safety then once he's out of danger he'll put her out of her misery-- ""I'll kill you later (thus the title of the movie)."" Shawn has nothing to lose; Charlie has everything. Pulling off his mask he makes a final plea. Shawn warily agrees to the deal.McGinley and Reed are settling in for dealing with a hostage situation when McGinley is distracted by a call from his untrusting and needy wife. SWAT arrives on the scene.To escape SWAT snipers Charlie and Shawn jump down to another ledge a few floors down and slip back into the bank; Charlie grabbing a woman's coat off a hanger to hide. Inside the coat pocket is a valet ticket that will let them grab a car and escape. Shawn claims the car with the ticket but it's a manual clutch that she doesn't know how to drive. Worse after Charlie sneaks in Shawn sees two officers inspecting all cars at the gate. Finally he thrusts his own foot down to floor the gas and burst through the gate alerting the officers at the checkpoint. Shawn cannot control the car properly and finally she and Charlie get out and abandon it running on foot; Charlie throwing aside the coat. The car which had started to be driven up a hill rolls back down and whacks into the pursuing police cars interrupting pursuit.Charlie and Shawn duck behind a dumpster and then climb into a meat truck to hide. When the truck stops they hurry out and run through the city though they can still hear the sirens of police cars searching for them. They keep running until they can no longer hear the pursuing sirens. On a main street blending in with other pedestrians they're safe. Charlie and Shawn appear to have made good their escape. All that remains is for Charlie to hold up his end of the bargain and kill Shawn-- exactly what he's never really had the heart or nerve to do. He also reminds shawn of the difference between suicide and murder. To her outrage he tells her that she'll just have to step in front of one of the passing streetcars and let it run her down.As Charlie walks away Shawn does just that; she steps into the path of an oncoming streetcar. Before it can reach her Charlie runs back and pulls her to safety. Shawn shows she's lifted his wallet and has his name and social security code memorized using them as blackmail. Frustrated and desperate Charlie tries to bribe Shawn though he says she has to do what he says and not piss about it.11:30 am. McGinley and Reed question Matthew for what he remembers about the robbery. They also ask about the girl on the roof whose intended suicide botched the robbery up. Matthew denies seeing any girl on the roof although when McGinley describes the girl's brunette hair and black suit Matthew realizes it's Shawn. He still denies knowing anything about her although McGinley and Reed can tell by his look that he knows something. Reed begins to suspect that the robbery itself might even be a set-up with Matthew behind it. McGinley can't deny the look in Matthew's eyes when Shawn was discussed. Another amusing subplot emerges as we see Reed deliver a very detailed lecture on the nature of suicide and people looking to kill themselves. McGinley is harassed by his wife again on the phone.Charlie finally starts to break through and gets a smile out of Shawn when he puts her cigarette in his mouth backward in a joking impression of a train.McGinley and Reed have a composite sketch of Shawn made and they show it to Matthew. He says the drawing isn't familiar but he's busted in humiliating fashion when his secretary brings in some papers and looks at the drawing immediately telling the detectives who Shawn is and that she works at the bank and that she and Matthew were 'very close.'Charlie brings Shawn to his ex-girlfriend (Sarah Chalke) Linda's apartment as the ex's elderly neighbor Mrs. Sabatini (Bethoe Shirkoff) looks on with scorn; she always disliked Charlie. Shawn sees that Charlie has a young daughter with Linda although the child doesn't know that Charlie is her father. Charlie asks to borrow Linda's car saying she can report it stolen if it's not returned in two days. Linda shows that granting the favor is going far against her better judgment as she goes to get the keys.The two drive in silence listening to the radio report on the search for Charlie and Billy who's also still at large. Shawn finally mocks Charlie as spineless and irresponsible in having children and abandoning them. This pisses Charlie off and he puts Shawn in her place with a stern lecture about what really happened-- he spent two years in jail for a petty crime and Linda stopped visiting him and started seeing another man. When Charlie was released he saw Linda with her new man and Molly thinking that was her father since he loved her and treated her like a daughter. Rather than blow his cool and start any fights Charlie forced himself to swallow his pride and stepped away for his daughter's sake because the arrangement was right for her.McGinley and Reed speak to Shawn's father although it's his wife who tells most of the story about how Shawn's mother drank herself to death after her divorce and Shawn's father still was a good parent to her putting her through school and college and taking her to movies.4:45 pm: McGinley and Reed hear that Jason is out of recovery after the hospital treated his bullet wound. Meanwhile Charlie and Shawn arrive back at a shipwright building where Charlie has a hideout. Charlie's been refurbishing a boat there that he intends to use to escape to Mexico. Billy hasn't arrived back yet (he's gone to see his girlfriend Heather (Keegan Connor Tracy) an exotic dancer) and Charlie says they'll wait until 11 pm for him. Heather doesn't want to make time for Billy until he tells her he has a lot of money on him.At the hospital McGinley and Reed try to grill Jason about his accomplices. Jason however is condescending and obnoxious refusing to talk without his lawyer present.Heather has a near orgasmic experience looking at the money from the robbery and tries to sweet talk Billy into forgetting about Charlie (who's still being sought by the police) and run away with her and the money. Billy struggles to maintain his sense of loyalty to Charlie and to stick with 'the plan.'As they wait Charlie continues to break down Shawn's heavy shell of self-pity. They talk about their dreams (Charlie wants to build a restaurant on a beach in Venezuela) and share some life stories. An innocent remark by Shawn about the Hava Nagila dance sparks an old memory in Charlie and he treats Shawn to her first dose of real fun in some time by getting her to dance with him.11:25 pm: Billy hasn't returned yet and Charlie tells Shawn they're leaving the boat.11:40 pm: Mrs. Sabatini watches the evening news and sees a report that includes Shawn's name and inset photo listing her as the hostage taken in the bank robbery. Mrs. Sabatini immediately recognizes Shawn's face and grabs her phone to call the police. Reed tells McGinley he's gotten Charlie's name and the license plate of Linda's car which Charlie had borrowed. An APB is already out. Reed puzzles McGinley by reciting more trivia on suicides.Charlie finds Billy at Heather's apartment and confronts him. Billy doesn't want to leave without Heather (who isn't home at the moment) while Charlie tries to tell Billy that Heather cares far more about the money than about Billy himself. Charlie challenges Billy to convince Heather to run away with him if he has only $5000 of the money.McGinley and Reed grill Jason at the hospital again telling him he's looking at life in San Quentin if he doesn't cooperate. Jason isn't scared believing he doesn't have much longer to live due to his problems with his liver and prostate. But in his bravado he accidentally lets slip a major clue: That Shawn hostage or not isn't 'the fourth one.' There are four people in the robbery plan not just Jason Charlie and Billy.1:15 am: Charlie gives Shawn the $50000 bribe money he's promised her and tries to tell her he'll always remember everything she's done for him. Shawn starts to cry again and runs toward the beach intent on running into the water and drowning herself. Charlie stops her and she begs him to take her with him. Staying with Charlie is the one thing that will give her something to live for.A police siren alerts them to trouble: An officer gets out of a squad car and starts examining their vehicle. Despite Shawn's tearful pleas to run with her Charlie insists on recovering the rest of the money which is still in the station wagon.As the officer returns to his car Charlie sneaks around the front of the car and tries to hurry away. The officer shoots at the car and Charlie is hit. Shawn races to the car and climbs in driving away. Reed reports to McGinley. All hospitals and ER's have been put on alert and are being checked. Reed has also found photo booth snapshots in Matthew's office showing Shawn kissing Matthew along with brochures for a getaway vacation. Unfortunately this only proves Matthew was having an affair with Shawn nothing more.Shawn and Charlie ditch the car at a bus stop and ride a bus climbing Shawn's fire escape to enter her apartment. Charlie just has a graze wound on the side of his shoulder; it hurts but he'll be okay. Shawn treats it at best she can with some supplies in her medicine cabinet.Charlie and Shawn hear the sound of entry into the apartment. They blow out the candle they'd been using-- the only light they'd allowed themselves since police are watching her apartment-- and Charlie readies his gun to confront the intruder.The intruder is Matthew... and he and Charlie know each other. Reed was right in his theory: The whole robbery was a setup orchestrated by Matthew himself. Matthew invested in what he thought was a sure get-rich quick scheme; a company intended to process chicken droppings into cow feed. Matthew embezzled a quarter million from the bank only to see it all gone when the cows didn't like the manufactured feed. He hired Charlie to rob the armored car so he could put the embezzled money back before the bank noticed. Matthew hid the stock certificates for the investment in Shawn's apartment; he's come to retrieve them. Matthew and Shawn have it out over their affair (Matthew never intended to dump his wife for Shawn and sees her suicide attempt that started the whole mess as pathetic).Charlie points out plainclothes officers staking the apartment out which sends Matthew into a panic. Charlie grabs the stock certificates back and tells Matthew that he needs to walk out and tell the officer that he came to Shawn's house to pray for her safety. This also creates a distraction so Charlie and Shawn can escape the way they came in through the fire escape.Charlie's warning to Billy comes true: Heather blows her stack and dumps Billy in brutal fashion. Billy plus a rather small portion of the robbery money equals nothing that Heather had any interest in.Shawn tries to hail a cab while arguing with Charlie. She intends to get a ride to the Burrad bridge and jump. Charlie tells her that her self-pity and self-loathing are what drive her to affairs with men like Matthew who care nothing for her so that her cycle of despair can self-perpetuate. A cab stops Shawn gets in and rides off.3:45 am: Reed reports more findings to McGinley. He's checked all records at the bank going back two months and found enough evidence for an arrest warrant. Matthew was grabbed at the airport and started 'crying like a baby.' McGinley finds it incredulous that Shawn was going to commit suicide over her failed affair with Matthew and when Reed goes into another monologue of suicide-related trivia McGinley finally pushes him to admit why he's become such a know-it-all on the nature of suicide: Reed lost a sister he was very close to that way. She killed herself.Shawn is dropped off at her father's house. Lyle has little time to express his relief however: Shawn came to give him the money she was given by Charlie calling it reimbursement for everything he spent on her after the divorce from her mother. Shawn finally calls her father out on how her mother wasted away after the divorce and Shawn had to take care of her despite being only eleven at the time of the divorce. Shawn understood her father leaving her mother but could never understand how he left Shawn. Lyle can say nothing as Shawn hurries back to her cab.Charlie finds Billy back at the boat. Billy tells him about how Heather dumped him. Charlie tells Billy that police only know one more suspect is at large and Billy hasn't been identified yet. He needs to return home and go straight and try to rebuild his life.The cab drops Shawn off at the bridge. After paying the cabbie Shawn discreetly leaves her purse in the backseat. As she sits on the railing of the bridge Charlie grabs his motorcycle and drives off. He escapes just as police cruisers converge on the shipwright building. Shawn lights up a cigarette but can't finish it. Again she wrestles with herself conflicted on whether to jump. Charlie gives the pursuing police cruisers the slip as Shawn cries miserably.Morning has risen. Shawn still stands on the bridge. She smiles in elation as Charlie comes riding up. Charlie asks her if she'd wait for him if he turned himself in for his part in the robbery. Shawn says she'd wait a million years. Having Charlie gives her a purpose in life again. Charlie suddenly has another idea; they could jump from the bridge and swim together to safety. Shawn just has to trust in him.Police cruisers approach. Charlie and Shawn stand together on the railing. Together they leap from the bridge as in the first scene of the movie.McGinley and Reed arrive at the spot where Charlie and Shawn jumped. They find that Charlie left behind his duffel bag with the stolen money. Recovering it for the bank the two officers decide to report the young lovers as having jumped to their deaths and with the money retrieved and Matthew in custody for masterminding the robbery the case can be closed.Shawn sits on a rocky beachhead before a small makeshift campsite. Charlie comes out of the treeline leading a Mexican mariachi band and holding a bouquet of roses. Shawn laughs happily as Charlie picks her up over his shoulder and runs into the surf carrying her with him.
A series of title cards shows what becomes of the major cast in the movie:Jason did not die and now coaches senior volleyball at the prison where he's serving a five-year sentence.McGinley took his wife on a well-deserved Carribean cruise.Billy never identified as a suspect in the robbery went straight and got a job in construction and met a new girl.
And the get-rich-quick scheme takes off as the chicken shit just needed a little salt in order to be processed into a feed that the cows loved. The stock certificates become worthwhile. With the money from the stock Charlie and Shawn escape to the mountains of Chihuahua Mexico open their little cafe together and proudly serve the finest margaritas in town."
Shawn Holloway has a miserable life since she was eleven when her father left her mother and she stayed alone with her problematic mother. Presently she is graduated works in a bank and is the mistress of her married colleague Matthew Richmond. When she finds that Matthew's wife is pregnant she decides to commit suicide.

Meanwhile the bank where she works is being robbed by Charlie Anders and two friends of him. When the cops arrive to save Shawn the heist is in progress and the police shoot one robber the driver escapes and Charlie runs to the top of the building.

"Petty-criminal-gone-straight Terry Leather (Jason Statham) owns a failing car-sales garage and feels harassed by two debt-collectors. His friend the photographer Kevin Swain's (Stephen Campbell Moore) ex-girlfriend a former model named Martine Love (Saffron Burrows) offers Terry a chance to earn enough money to never worry about debt again: a bank robbery in Baker Street London. Leather gathers his petty-criminal friends including Swain a pornographic actor Dave Shilling (Daniel Mays) a Cypriot mechanic named Bambos (Alki David) and an elegant con-man ""Major"" Guy Singer (James Faulkner). While scouting out the bank Leather and Love enter and inspect the vault while Shilling poses for photographs by Swain. The gangster Lew Vogel (David Suchet) who keeps records of his pay-offs to police at Lloyds bank happens upon Shilling and Swain.They lease a shop named Le Sac two lots away from the bank and dig a tunnel under The Chicken Inn fast-food restaurant to reach the underground bank vault. Terry employs Eddie Burton (Michael Jibson) one of his garage workers as a ""watchman"" with a walkie-talkie to sit on a roof to keep look-out. Martine once caught smuggling heroin into Britain and wanting to avoid jail set them up for this job on behalf of MI5 which desires the contents of a certain safe deposit box No. 118. This box contains sensual and compromising photos of a member of the British Royal Family (in the film Princess Margaret). The photos and box belong to a black militant gangster who calls himself Michael X (Peter de Jersey); he uses the photos to avoid trouble with the Metropolitan Police and MI5 is charged with keeping the photos out of circulation.As Terry's crew digs the radio chatter draws the attention of a local amateur radio operator who overhears the conversation and realizes a robbery is in progress. He calls the police who begin to search their ten-mile radius and listen for concrete details to pin the robbery down. Terry's crew breaks through and loot the vault as Martine goes for the photo deposit-box. A suspicious Terry opens it with her and upon seeing the pictures realizes Martine's hidden agenda. Among the photos are many of high-ranking government officials including a senior MP in compromising positions in a local S&M brothel. The robbers take these with money and other valuables. Terry arranges for alternate transportation ""to be safe"" throwing off MI5 who had intended to intercept them. Guy and Bambas escape with their share and Terry confronts Martine over the photos who explains the unfolding predicament. The robbery discovered the police corrupt ones receiving payoffs and honest ones began an investigation while MI5 continues their search. Also joining the search for Terry's crew is Lew Vogel an organized crime figure worried about the contents of his ledger which lists payoffs he made to police which was stolen in the robbery. He informs Michael X that the royal 'portraits' had gone missing and Michael X becomes suspicious of Gale Benson (Hattie Morahan) a British spy who loves his American colleague Black Power militant Hakim Jamal (Colin Salmon) and has traveled with him and Jamal to Trinidad.Remembering the encounter with Shilling outside of the bank before the robbery Vogel has him tortured for information with a sandblaster. Shilling breaks and Vogel goes to Terry's garage and kidnaps Eddie the lookout. Meanwhile a senior minister in the government Lord Drysdale is shown photos of himself in the brothel run by Sonia Bern (Sharon Maughan) and agrees to help absolve the robbers and secure them safe passage. Meanwhile MI5 issues a D-Notice forbidding press reports. Police simultaneously release recordings of the walkie-talkie conversations in the hope that someone will recognize the voices. These recordings are heard on the radio by Terry's family. Vogel's accomplice corrupt Detective Gerald Pyke (Don Gallagher) shoots Dave and threatens to shoot Eddie unless Vogel gets his ledger back. Vogel agrees with Terry to meet him at Paddington Station in London. During this time Guy and Bambas are murdered by persons unknown and Michael X has Benson killed in Trinidad by an associates. Terry has Kev give the same instruction to Detective Sergeant Roy Given (Gerard Horan) the officer in charge of the investigation citing knowledge of corrupt officers under Vogel's control. He convinces Vogel to go to Paddington Station at the same time offering him the ledger in return for Eddie's safe return.Terry heads to the rendezvous while Martine meets up with Tim Everett (Richard Lintern) her original contact in MI5 on a bridge overlooking the scene. Vogel and his corrupt police arrive with the mechanic but recognize the MI5 agents and run. The deputy head of MI5 (with Lord Mountbatten) hands over the passports Terry bargained for in return for the photos of the princess. Terry then chases Vogel and in a fight knocks out Vogel and his thugs including corrupt Detective Nick Barton (Craig Fairbrass). Detective Given officer in charge of the investigation arrives to see the robbers arrested. He speaks with the MI5 officers present who direct police to let the robbers go. Terry gives the ledger to the police officer before he Kevin and Eddie leave the scene. Vogel and the corrupt officers are arrested instead. Everett personally supervises Michael X's arrest in Trinidad and Tobago and has Benson's remains exhumed for reburial in Britain. The final scenes have Terry and Martine saying good-bye and Terry and his family enjoying a relaxed and carefree life on a small motor yacht of their own off a sunny beach.The epilogue states that the revelations about the brothel forced many government officials to resign. Scotland Yard begins investigating the corrupt officers named in the ledger. Michael X was hanged in 1975 for Benson's murder and his personal files are kept hidden in the British National Archives until 2054. Vogel is imprisoned for eight years for crimes that were unrelated to the robbery. The murderers of Guy and Bambas have never been found. About 4 million worth of materials and money were stolen from the robbery. At least 100 safety-deposit box owners did not claim insurance nor identify the items in the boxes."

"Writer Jimmy Breslin begins narrating the film; telling the viewer about New York City's current prosperity. However things were not always this way showing news articles from 1977 about the .44 Caliber Killer and explaining how the city was in a massive state of decay explaining that ""there are 8 million stories in the naked city and this is one of them.""We are shown a disgusting apartment with a man screaming to stop an incessant dog barking. Eventually he goes out and shoots two girls talking in a parked car. The film cuts to Vinny (John Leguizamo) and his wife Dionna (Mira Sorvino) going to a night club for dancing and to meet up with their friends. Dionna's cousin asks to be taken home and Vinny offers to give her a ride allowing Dionna to stay. We soon discover the real reason he offered to take her home was to have sex with her in the back seat of his car. However before he can finish the two are scared off by another couple in the car behind him. As Vinny speeds off the killer comes out of the bushes and kills the couple.While driving Dionna home she begins questioning what took Vinny so long to drive her cousin home. Vinny offers the excuse that he had to urinate but before she can question him further they arrive at the exact same spot where Vinny was having his affair only now it is a crime scene. Vinny goes to investigate and to his horror it is the same couple that scared him off. Vinny begins vomiting as he gets back to the car telling Dionna that the .44 Caliber Killer is back. The next day as Vinny's friends; Joey T (Michael Rispoli) Brian and Anthony inquire about the killer they tell Vinny that the killer probably saw him and will come after him too. Although they are joking Vinny begins taking this to heart. Soon after Ritchie (Adrien Brody) shows up in a punk fashion to which all except Vinny object to. Ruby (Jennifer Esposito) is the last to arrive and after being dumped by her boyfriend who was only using her for sex immediately takes an interest in Ritchie and his new style.At Dionna's father's restaurant the local mob boss Luigi (Ben Gazzara) is asked by one of the detectives (Anthony LaPaglia) on the .44 Caliber Killer case for help. Luigi initially refuses but after hearing the letter left by the .44 Caliber Killer now called the Son of Sam agrees. Meanwhile as Ruby discusses her current predicaments with Vinny at the salon Ritchie comes in asking for money as he has been kicked out and forced to move into his garage after walking in on his mother and stepfather having sex. Vinny offers to give Ritchie a place to stay for a while but Ruby convinces him to move into the garage and fix it up with her help. That night as Ritchie and Ruby finish redecorating the garage Ruby attempts to give Ritchie oral sex but he asks her to stop. Before she can leave Ritchie explains that just because he doesn't want to have sex with her doesn't mean he wants her to leave.Back at the salon as Vinny and his boss Gloria (Bebe Neuwirth) begin having sex Vinny begins feeling guilty but quickly gets over it and has sex with her. After being told by Anthony and Brian that he no longer fits in in the neighborhood Ritchie takes Ruby to a gay theatre where he has been dancing and secretly selling his body for money. During Ritchie's performance the owner Midnite (Michael Imperioli) asks Ruby what she likes to do as she is too hot to be giving it away for free. Outside the theatre Ruby admits that she has fallen for Ritchie and begins dressing in punk. Meanwhile after yet another letter to the police from the Son of Sam Vinny's paranoia reaches a boiling point and although Dionna tries to comfort him he is unable to perform with her. With the police making no headway with the Son of Sam Luigi decides to take matters into his own hands and catch the killer and offers another $5000 to the reward hoping at least to get more names on their list of suspects. Meanwhile at a pizzeria; Joey T Anthony Brian and the heroin addict Woodstock are devising their own list which is primarily made up of people they don't like. At the top of their list however is Ritchie.While at a diner Vinny and Ritchie discuss their relationships but are asked to leave as Ritchie is scaring some of the other patrons. Before a fight can break out Ritchie breaks a glass over his head to intimidate the other customers trying to pick a fight with him and Vinny. As they walk down the beach Ritchie tries to explain himself to Vinny but the conversation proves to be too deep for him to follow. With temperatures reaching 104 a blackout hits the Five Boroughs. To defend themselves and their neighborhood from the Son of Sam from trying anything Luigi has a block party for everyone while Joey T leads a mob to patrol the neighborhood beating and attacking anyone who tries to enter. As this is going on; Ritchie Vinny Dionna and Ruby are having dinner where Ritchie invites them to come see him and his band perform at the club CBGB while in the bathroom Dionna asks Ruby for advice on what to do about Vinny as she doesn't seem to please him. The only advice Ruby can give is to not be married to him. Vinny and Dionna go to the club but are scared off by all the people outside. Instead they try to get into Studio 54 but the bouncer refuses to let them in. They are however greeted by another man who takes them to another club: Plato's Retreat. There he and Dionna get stoned and have sex as well as three-ways with other people. On the way home Vinny mocks an already embarrassed and humiliated Dionna out of jealousy more than anything. In the following fight Dionna reveals that she knew he had sex with her cousin and drives off leaving Vinny chasing after the car.As July 29 arrives Joey T and the others begin slashing the car tires of everyone on their list while we see the real Son of Sam descending further into madness and is now seeing a black dog telling him to go out and kill. The next day at the diner Vinny Joey T and the others are eating when the owner come over tells Vinny that he and Ritchie have been kicked out due to Ritchie's actions. Before Joey T can get more information Vinny storms out. Meanwhile Bobby the Fairy yet another friend of Joey T's group sees Ritchie in the gay theatre to which Ritchie threatens to kill him should he tell anyone. Although Ritchie is only trying to protect his name Bobby takes this literally. That night we see the Son of Sam kill yet another two victims in Brooklyn.Joey T and the others are now beginning to suspect that Ritchie is the Son of Sam as he is the only one whose whereabouts they cannot account for but Vinny stands up for him saying that he knows Ritchie as if he were his brother. They all reveal to Vinny that Ritchie has been dancing and shooting porn films with Ruby at the gay theatre and ask if he knew that. Although Vinny is shocked by this he still refuses to accept that Ritchie is the Son of Sam but reluctantly agrees to help Joey T and the others by telling them where Ritchie and his band perform. Joey T and Anthony go to CBGB to try and find Ritchie while outside Vinny has already met up with him. He begins to ask Ritchie if hes in a cult dancing in a gay joint and is the Son of Sam. Ritchie is upset that Vinny actually would think that way about him but is angered that he brought Joey T down to get him and walks off. The following day a composite sketch of the killer is released and everyone sees someone different. No surprise Joey T tries to convince Vinny that its Ritchie; however Vinny doesn't see any resemblance until Joey T draws in spiky hair on the picture. Looking more like Ritchie now Vinny begins freaking out. So much so that when he goes to the salon he explodes on Gloria and dumps his drink on her storming off. By the time he gets home Gloria has already called Dionna and told her about all the women he cheated on her with. Vinny attempts to apologies and tries explain that Ritchie may be a killer but it is too late; a heartbroken Dionna leaves him. This sends Vinny spiraling out of control as he begins drowning himself in cocaine and Quaaludes.With Richie back at his parents' garage Joey T and the others decide to make their move and capture Ritchie and take him to Luigi. However before they go Joey T decides to get Vinny. They break into Vinny's house to find him stoned and force him to come help lure Ritchie out of the house promising not to hurt him. Unbeknownst to them during this time the police have captured David Berkowitz the real Son of Sam. Meanwhile Vinny comes knocking on Ritchie's door and tells him that Dionna left him. Ritchie invites him in but Vinny asks him to come outside not wanting Ruby to hear. As the two talk Vinny tries to tell Ritchie to run but before he can understand what Vinny is saying Joey T and the others spring on him. Vinny watches as Ritchie uses his guitar to defend himself but is quickly beaten senseless by the group. Ruby is restrained by Bobby as they drag Ritchie off. However they don't get too far as Ritchie's stepfather Eddie (Mike Starr) comes out of the house brandishing a Luger pistol. As Joey T tries to explain who Ritchie is Eddie reveals to them that the cops had already caught the Son of Sam in Yonkers much to the group's surprise. As they begin to leave Vinny can only look at a bloodied and beaten Ritchie with guilt and weakly attempts to apologize to his former friend before walking away too.Jimmy Breslin recaps the events of the summer of 1977; David Berkowitz was done in by a parking ticket and is serving six consecutive terms of 25 years to life the Yankees won the World Series Elvis Presley died and 3700 were arrested during the blackout. He finishes by reiterating that ""there are 8 million stories in the naked city and this was one of them."""

"The Tagline is a gross misrepresentation of statistics. The actual estimate of awarness during anesthesia is 1:14000 for high risk patients to as low as 1:42000.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Capital-investment firm chief Clay Beresford (Christensen) is in love with a woman named Sam (Alba) but is unwilling to tell his mother (Olin) of their relationship. We later find out this is due to Sam being his mother's personal assistant. Clay suffers from a heart condition that requires a heart transplant to be carried out by Dr. Jack Harper (Howard) who had previously saved his life and is now his good friend. His mother and her famous surgeon boyfriend Dr. Jonathan Neyer (Arliss Howard) try to dissuade him from going through the operation with a team of surgeons that have so many malpractice suits pending. Because of his mother's intrusion in his decision to have his friend perform the operation it seems that Clay begins to grow distant from his mother and eventually discloses his relationship with his fiance Sam. Clay's mother does not take kindly to Clay's haste and asks him to wait until he is older than his 22 years.Clay becomes upset and leaves with his fiance. He asks Dr. Harper to arrange a wedding for him and Sam immediately. They marry in a private ceremony in a church at midnight. After the wedding Clay is notified by the hospital that it's time to perform the operation. Clay then goes to the hospital to get surgery. His mother tries to dissuade him again and refer him to a better clinic and a more experienced doctor. Clay brushes aside their concerns as attempts to interfere with his friendships and proceeds with his original plans touching upon the point that ""he trusts Jack"". However during surgery Clay encounters ""anesthetic awareness"" which is a condition that renders a patient completely paralyzed unable to move or speak but able to hear the doctors and more importantly still feel pain. To escape the excruciating pain of having his chest sliced open and his ribs separated Clay attempts to focus on Sam now his wife and eventually has an out-of-body experience and uncovers a murder plot against him. (Spoiler warning).During his outerbody experience Clay discovers that Dr. Harper one other surgeon and a nurse are in on a plot to inject his transplanted heart with a chemical that will cause it to be rejected upon transplantation. Dr. Harper has second thoughts at which point Clay's new wife Sam comes in. Apparently she is a main part of the whole scheme. The doctors want Clay to die because now that he and Sam are married his millions will go to her and in turn pay for all the hospital's malpractice suits (later we find out that Sam used to be a nurse there). She proceeds to encourage him and even coerces him to go through with the plan and inject the transplanted heart. The heart if rejected would cause Clay to die because he (like his mother is O negative - a rare blood type) will not find a transplant in time.In the operating room one of the conspirators fails to show up and a seemingly inept anesthesiologist with an apparent drinking problem named Dr. Larry Lupin shows up to replace him. Meanwhile Clay's mother anxiously awaits for the results of the operation. Sam tries to win over her mother in law during her vulnerable moment. One of the surgeons makes a move on Sam since he feels he had seen her before.During his out of body experience Clay discovers and remembers things about his wife that point to her deceipt. Meanwhile as Sam is shuttling between the operating room and consoling (winning over) Clay's mother she forgets her purse in the waiting room. Clay's mother growing suspicious of Clay's newly wed wife looks through her purse and discovers that Sam was a nurse before she became her assistant. Clay during his out of body experience finds that Sam worked at the hospital and worked under Dr. Harper. He is dejected and accepting his fate walks (during his out of body experience) to his own home and awaits death.Clay's mother begins piecing together the situation based on Sam's behavior and conversations and finally gets a notion of what's going on. Upon discovering the truth she takes an overdose of some of her son's medicine and calls her boyfriend Dr. Neyer and tells him the whole situation. She tells him to come save her son. Dr. Neyer returns to evict Dr. Harper and upon seeing the mother's death realises that she overdosed so that he could save her son (they had the same rare blood type). He then transplants the mother's heart into the son. Dr. Harper and his associates are arrested after Dr. Lupin is revealed to be an undercover police officer.As the transplant is complete Clay refuses to leave ""limbo"" since he has nothing left in the outside world after the death of his mother. His mother then proceeds to remind Clay that limbo with his mother and an afterlife with his father may not be that ideal. She reminds him that his father was a cocaine addict who was abusive to his son. During one such quarrel she had accidentally murdered her own husband as he was about to harm a young Clay. Dr. Harper continues to narrate the story noting that Clay eventually had his revenge. Clay then wakes up while Dr. Harper's words close the movie with ""He is awake""."

"Told through the narration of a grown-up ""Shakes"" four young boys: Lorenzo ""Shakes""(Joseph Perrino) Michael (Brad Renfro) Tommy (Jonathan Tucker) and John (Geoffrey Wigdor) are the best of friends growing up in Hell's Kitchen in New York City. Their family lives are hard involving broken homes and spousal abuse and the boys turn to street antics and volunteering as altar boys to escape. Father Bobby (Robert De Niro) an ex convict turned priest watches out for them and tries to mold them into upstanding members of society. Despite their good hearts the boys get into all kinds of trouble including sneaking into confessionals and pretending to be priests and playing pranks on nuns. Shakes becomes an errand boy and fast friends with a street kingpin named King Benny who runs all the illegal activity in Hell's Kitchen.One fateful day Michael suggests they knock off a hotdog vendor out of boredom. When Shakes runs off with a hotdog the vendor gives chase leaving the stand unsupervised and allowing the three other boys to feast in his absence. Michael suggests that they leave the cart teetering on the edge of the subway entrance so when the vendor comes back he'll have to struggle to keep it from falling giving them time to escape. In a tragic turn of events the cart crashes down the stairs hitting and almost killing an elderly man.The boys are sentenced to a year in the Wilkinson Home for Boys. Because Shakes arrived at the scene of the cart crash later than the others (and because of the vouching of Father Bobby) he's only sentenced to 6 months. The boys hardly fit into the home which is filled with boys who have committed much more serious crimes and are subject to their ridicule and beatings. Worst of all is a guard named Sean Nokes (Kevin Bacon) who quickly turns the boys lives into a living hell. He begins by humiliating them along with three other guards Henry Addison Adam Styler and Ralph Ferguson (Jeffrey Donovan Lennie Loftin and Terry Kinney respectively). Nokes embarrasses them in front of the other inmates by making them eat off the floor. The abuse escalates to beatings at night. He and the three other guards drag the four boys into the basement of the home where they repeatedly beat and rape them. It's suggested that this abuse becomes a nightly occurrence for the boys.The boys no longer innocent and filled with shame write to their parents to tell them not to visit; afraid they'll know what's been going on. Father Bobby refuses to stay away and urges Shakes to not let the home change him for the worse.The home holds a football game between the guards and inmates once a year for all the town to see. Michael convinces Rizzo an intimidating black inmate to not let the guards win this year out of fear of the consequences but instead fight back as hard as possible. Rizzo agrees and the four boys and a few other inmates fight dirty and beat the guards in front of the whole town. Disgraced and angry Nokes and the other guards throw the four boys into solitary confinement starving them for two weeks straight. Shakes wakes up in the infirmary and is told by Michael that the guards beat Rizzo to death.As Shakes' release date nears the four boys agree that once they get out of the home they won't breathe a word about what happened there to anyone and bury it as deep in their minds as possible.---------More thirteen years later two men walk into a pub and order a drink. Shakes' narration describes them as two of the most dangerous men in Hell's Kitchen. Both are members of the gang The West Side Boys. Both are murderers and drug users. The blonde man walks towards the bathroom and notices Nokes sitting by himself and eating dinner. He stares him down and Nokes reacts with annoyance. The blonde man tells him to enjoy his dinner and enters the bathroom. He returns to his dark-haired friend at the bar and tells him to look closely at Nokes. The dark-haired man recognizes him too and they both approach him. They sit down and introduce themselves as grown-up Tommy and John (Billy Crudup and Ron Eldard). Nokes says they were wimpy kids and he tried to make them tough. They point their guns at him. He tells them they're going to burn in hell. John says ""You first"" before they shoot him dead. Several people in the bar witness the shooting and hide their heads as Tommy and John walk out.Meanwhile Shakes (Jason Patric) now a newspaper columnist meets with Michael (Brad Pitt) now an assistant district attorney. Michael says he's going to take the Sean Nokes murder case as the prosecuting attorney. Shakes reacts with anger before Michael tells him he's going to take the case to lose. Not only that he's planning on revealing the corrupt Wilkinson Home for what it really is. He asks Shakes to help him bring his plan to fruition. Michael hands Shakes years of research on the three other guards who had tortured them all those years ago.Shakes meets with Carol (Minnie Driver) a childhood friend of the boys and ex-girlfriend of Michael and asks for her help finding files for the case since she has access as a social worker. She tells him that she's with John now and asks why he never asked her out. He said he never had the guts because she was Mikey's girl.Shakes enlists the help of King Benny who makes sure the fallen and disgraced drunk Danny Snyder (Dustin Hoffman) is Tommy and John's defense lawyer making it seem even less likely the two men will walk. Shakes meets with an internal affairs agent to give him information on Adam Styler who has now become a cop and his cocaine habit as well as his illegal trafficking activity. King Benny meets with drug kingpin Little Caesar revealed to be Rizzo's older brother and tells him the truth of Rizzo's death at the hands of Henry Addison in the Wilkinson home. Little Caesar was told Rizzo died of pneumonia.Shakes and Carol meet with Father Bobby and ask him to be Tommy and John's alibi for the night of the murder. Father Bobby doesn't want to swear to God and then lie on the stand. He asks why he should lie to let two guilty men who will surely kill again go free. He asks why Nokes' life means nothing to Shakes. Shakes tells him and Carol everything that happened while he Michael Tommy and John were at Wilkinson's. Afterward Father Bobby says he has some thinking to do and tells them goodnight.In court Michael successfully begins to throw the case conveniently forgetting to present the jury with a motive. With the help of a list of questions and answers Michael previously provided him Snyder successfully displays one of the witnesses as a ""scared woman who had too much to drink"" making it questionable whether Tommy and John were ever in the bar to begin with. Michael calls a character witness for Nokes by the name of Ralph Ferguson. Ferguson tells the jury that Nokes was a good man and didn't deserve to be killed by two street punks. Snyder uses Michael's question list to grill Ferguson on the goings-on of the Wilkinson Home for Boys. He asks him about the beatings and rapes and whether he and Nokes participated. Ferguson realizing who the defendants are breaks down and confesses. He's dismissed by the judge but told not to stray too far from home since there are people who will ""want to talk to him"".The next day Father Bobby gets on the stand swears to tell the truth and says that Tommy and John were with him at a Knicks game the night of the murder. Michael asks him if he has any proof. Father Bobby produces three ticket stubs.The jury finds Tommy and John not guilty.Addison's body is found in a swamp by La Guardia airport. Shot to death by Little Caesar's men. Adam Styler is arrested by internal affairs.The four friends and Carol meet for a private party. They share stories of their childhood and sing ""Walk Like a Man"" for Carol. Shakes' narration explains that this was the last night they would ever be together. Not long after that John's body is found in an apartment stairway next to a bottle of booze that killed him. About a year after that Tommy's body is found by the river with five bullets in his head. Both of them never reached thirty. Michael moves to England becomes a carpenter and never marries. Shakes still lives in Hell's Kitchen and writes for the paper. Carol is an unwed mother compliments of John and named her son John Michael Thomas. She calls him 'Shakes'."
After a prank goes disastrously wrong a group of boys are sent to a detention center where they are brutalized. Thirteen years later they get their chance for revenge.::Murray Chapman <muzzle@imdb.com>
As children Lorenzo Carcaterra - Shakes to his friends - Michael Sullivan Tommy Marcano and John Reilly were inseparable. They grew up in Hell's Kitchen a far from perfect neighborhood one filled as Shakes says with scams and shake downs but one where the rules were known by its residents. The one adult who they admired was Father Bobby Carelli who understood them as kids more than most adults and more than he himself would like to admit. In 1967 their lives would change forever when a typical teenage prank went wrong which led to the four of them being sentenced to various terms at Wilkinson Home for Boys a reformatory. There they were physically emotionally and sexually abused primarily by Sean Nokes the head guard of their cell block and fellow guards Ralph Ferguson Henry Addison and Adam Styler although there were other caring figures of authority at the home including other guards. Their time at the home affected the four not all who were able to emerge from the experience to regroup their lives. In their want to forget about the experience they made a vow not to talk about it either between themselves or with others. Fast forward thirteen years with Tommy and Johnny being career criminals Michael an assistant district attorney and Shakes a newspaper writer their friendship on the surface more loose than it was when they were children. When Tommy and John spot Nokes it leads to Shakes and Michael banding together to exact revenge not only on Nokes but all four of the guards who abused them. Michael had long mapped out a plan even before Tommy and John saw Nokes but that sighting and its aftermath alters the plan.

A boy Antoine Doinel is often in trouble at school and doesn't get along with his parents especially his mother. He briefly runs away from home but then returns. After a while he ups the ante and turns to petty crime.::grantss
14-year-old Antoine Doinel is unfairly punished in school by his teacher in French literature. Next morning his friend René suggests that they play truant. Instead of going to school they go to the cinema play pinball and visit a huge amusement rotor. The following day Antoine tells his teacher that his absence was due to his mother's death; unfortunately his parents turn up at school. Antoine loves his mother but she dislikes him because he is the result of an episodic intercourse in her youth before she met Antoine's stepfather. When things get worse both in school and at home Antoine runs away. René lives in a huge apartment with his rich parents who won't notice if Antoine sleeps in René's room. To get money Antoine steals a typewriter from his father's office. The machine is unsellable so he brings it back to the office where he is caught by an office janitor. Antoine's stepfather takes him to the police who imprison him for vagrancy and theft. A juvenile-court judge sends him to an observation centre in the countryside from where he runs away and doesn't stop until he reaches the sea.::Maths Jesperson {maths.jesperson1@comhem.se}
In Paris early-teen Antoine Doinel always seems to be in trouble. He has a short attention span and is easily distracted which leads to him doing poorly in school. Some of his problems stem from his home life with his mother Gilberte Doinel and his stepfather Julien Doinel who is the only father he has ever known as Gilberte and Julien married when Antoine was an infant. When Julien and Gilberte aren't working they leave Antoine alone to fend for himself. And even when they are home they are often arguing and their parenting is inconsistent leading to Antoine having no clear boundaries. On the most part Antoine truly believes that his mother does not love him. Those issues for which he is blamed are not always his fault and many of his contemporaries just don't get caught as often as Antoine seems to get caught. Even when Antoine tries to do the right thing he often is not given credit for his efforts or his efforts lead to a bad result. The former issue is especially prevalent at school where his teachers just believe that his school work will not be worth a passing grade. In general punishments have been ineffective in curbing his behavior as he just rebels more against them. Antoine is often supported and/or egged on in his activities by his best friend René who often skips school with him. Unless something drastic changes in Antoine's life he is destined down a path that will lead to nothing good which is more problematic as he gets older.::Huggo

At the invitation of an old friend fellow cop Freddy Ross Berlin bolts from the LAPD for a supposedly quieter life in rural California with the Eureka police force. Instead Berlin prickles his new colleagues including John ""J.K."" Taylor who was passed over for promotion in order to make room for Berlin by re-opening the case of a serial killer of blind girls which went unsolved despite a full-time six-month effort by the department.

"Detective (Lilly) Rush is a homicide detective working for the Philadelphia Police Department in the present day. Although she initially dabbled in current crimes she begins focusing on ""cold cases"" (murder cases in the past that were originally never solved). Assisting her along the way are her colleagues. Her boss and at times surrogate father figure John Stillman is her mentor and the one who was there for her in the past after she was assaulted as a child. Her partner Detective Scotty Valens is also her best friend and a street-smart guy who struggled with extreme grief and guilt after his schizophrenic girlfriend began seeing imaginary friends from childhood called ""the giants"" and eventually took her own life. Lilly grew up with an alcoholic mother who acted more like a needy child than a mom. Her father was out of the picture throughout childhood and her promiscuous sister Christina was known as the family tramp after Lilly's boyfriend cheated on her while he was drunk. Because of the ordeal Lilly often resents her entire family although she does care about them all the same.Among Lilly's other colleagues are:Detective Will Jeffries: Jeffries is a former Vietnam war vet and high school D.J. who while working as a police officer before getting into the homicide career lost his wife in a fatal truck hit-and-run accident. Because of the accident he often despises people who drive unsafely and ignore the rules of the road. He's one of the most valued members of the team and a good friend to the other detectives.Detective Kat Miller: Miller worked in narcotics and was introduced to homicide in Season 4. She's one of Lilly's best friends and knows the areas of Philadelphia like the back of her hand a useful skill as a detective. She has a daughter called Veronica whose deadbeat father is an ex-gangster. Initially Miller wants to keep Veronica away from her father at all costs because of his criminal past but by Season 7 she eventually decides to compromise with her former husband after he tries to gain full custody of the child.Detective Nick Vera: Vera is an overweight big-mouth at times but is actually very caring and really wants to have a family (his wife left him and started a family with another man). Vera is revealed in Season 7 to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown after unintentionally having an innocent man convicted of murder. Despite this he's a great cop.Franny: Franny is a medical forensics expert who often examines cadavers and crime scene evidence throughout the first half of the show.Louie: Louie is an expert at the science of fire and explosives using his skills to help solve crimes where these things were present as a weapon. Lilly likes him as a good friend and eventually he gets married to a science teacher and invites the Cold Case team to his wedding.Frankie: Frankie studies photography in the police department mostly working with traditional film. She has a brief relationship with Scotty.Cold Case is unique because unlike most crime shows it focuses on the past celebrating nostalgia and combining present technology and police methods with old-school music and references to things like vinyl records disco super 8 film roller rinks and the hippie counterculture among other things. As the show progresses it gets much more intense and several side-stories arise. The show also bases several episodes on films like The Breakfast Club The Ice Storm Fight Club and The Big Chill. Unfortunately Cold Case was cancelled by CBS during Season 7 but rumors about a revival have been brought up by fans of the show ever since.

"Baltimore Maryland 1987...after midnight. Terry Lambert (Steve Guttenberg) is coming home from a party at his boss's house to his place on East Mount Vernon near the Washington Monument. He hurries up to his second floor apartment looks the place over hastily stows a few stray items of bachelor clutter. He glances out the bedroom window sees that his guest is arriving and goes to meet her at his front door. She is a beautiful elegant Frenchwoman and we soon learn she is Sylvia Wentworth (Isabella Huppert) his boss's wife.They retire to the bedroom for a lengthy session of love-making. When they are through Terry excuses himself to go to the bathroom. A muffled scream outside attracts Sylvia's attention. She goes to the window and looks out...a man has grabbed a young woman from behind and is attempting to drag her toward the street. She calls to Terry and tries to open the window. It sticks at first...then it opens suddenly with a loud crack. The man startled looks directly up at her. She remembers she's naked and steps back behind the curtain. The distraction gives the victim a chance to get her breath and scream loudly for help. Lights come on doors open...and the man runs away. Terry comes out of the bathroom and joins Sylvia at the window. She tells him what she saw but it's all over now and people are helping the woman to safety. So they dress and he walks her to her car. ""Any regrets?"" he asks. ""None"" she replies. ""In spite of what happened...or perhaps because of it...it was the most exciting night I can remember.""Terry arrives late for work the next day at Wentworth Construction. The receptionist advises him that the boss Collin Wentworth (Paul Shenar) has been asking for him. Terry goes directly to his office. Collin asks where he disappeared to last night and Terry replies that he just went home. An office assistant brings a newspaper to Collin while they're talking and he separates out the business section to check his stocks. As Terry turns to leave an item on the front page of the Metro section catches his eye...a girl who was murdered the previous night a few blocks from his apartment. He borrows that section to read more about it.He meets Sylvia at his apartment at lunch. They discuss the murder and decide it could be related to the attack she witnessed. She says she wishes she could come forward and give a description of the man she saw to the police but she has so much to lose. On an impulse (and to impress her) Terry picks up the phone and calls the police. He tells them HE witnessed an attack from his bedroom window and wants to report it. Sylvia is alarmed but also excited. She coaches him on details tells him she'll wait in her car on the other side of the Washington Monument and leaves just before the police arrive.Detectives Quirke (Carl Lumbly) and Jessup (Frederick Coffin) seem quite pleased with Terry's story. They ask about a point or two but for the most part they accept it without question. It turns out they think the two incidents are related too...and this is a welcome lead.After they leave Terry goes out to where Sylvia is waiting and directs her to drive to the murdered girl's apartment. Terry explains to Sylvia (and we see in flashback) how the murder was done. Sylvia listens soberly then thanks him for helping her do the right thing. He asks when he'll see her again. ""Soon"" she promises ""very soon.""When Terry returns from lunch Collin stops him and jokingly asks him if he's been up to something he shouldn't. ""The police were trying to contact you"" he says and gives him the number to call back. Terry explains that he witnessed an assault the night of the party. Collin curious follows him back to his office to listen in on the call. Detective Quirke asks if Terry can come to the precinct that night at 7 p.m. He agrees and hangs up. Collin has already lost interest...implies that Terry is a fool to get involved.At the precinct that night Terry stops at the desk and asks for Detectives Quirke and Jessup. The desk officer (Joyce Greer) tells him they're a little late getting set up and to wait over there pointing to a bench in the lobby. He goes to the bench and sits down. A young woman--tall slim pretty with short curly dark hair--sits next to him. She looks at him expectantly. He glances at her distractedly then goes back to the desk officer to ask what she meant by getting set up. ""You're here for the line-up right?"" she says. He is completely gob-smacked. The young woman approaches now and says ""You must be the one!"" She pauses sensing a problem and adds uncertainly ""I mean they told me there was a witness..."" Detectives Quirke and Jessup join them at this point and confirm that they are indeed here for a line-up. The young woman Denise Connelly (Elizabeth McGovern) reminds them that she didn't see her assailant at all. Detective Quirke tells her that sometimes people see more than they realize...""but anyway Mr. Lambert here got a good look."" Terry looks cornered...he hadn't bargained for this.True to her word Denise is unable to identify her attacker. Terry looks uneasily at all the subjects. We see that the suspect is among them and Terry hesitates when he looks at him...something about Sylvia's description clicks. But he doesn't feel confident enough to positively identify him. Detectives Quirke and Jessup are disappointed. ""One of these men has done this kind of thing before"" Quirke admits. ""From your description I thought... I guess I was wrong. I guess we keep looking.""Terry walks out of the station with Denise. She has seen him before she says at Edgar's the Poe-themed cocktail bar where she works. ""My night for not recognizing anyone"" he mumbles. She also tells him she's sorry he wasn't able to identify the suspect because she won't feel safe again until they catch her attacker. In spite of himself Terry is beginning to feel involved. As he walks her to her car he sees the suspect come out of the police station and get into an old beat-up pickup truck. When Denise drives away Terry jumps in his own car and follows him to a rough-looking neighborhood by the shipyards. The suspect parks in front of the house on the corner and goes inside. Terry drives by slowly looking in the windows...sees him get a beer from the fridge and go to stand behind an older woman (mother?) watching a flickering TV. ""Didn't even tell her"" says Terry to himself musing.He is there in the morning to follow the suspect to his work as a welder in a shipyard. He returns with Sylvia at lunch. The adventure is wearing thin for Sylvia...she says she isn't sure he's the one and she still can't go to the police anyway. She tells him pointedly that next time they get together they shouldn't spend all their time driving around.But Terry continues to follow the suspect. That night they wind up in the Fells Point Saloon downtown. The suspect positions himself near the bar where he can watch the girls. Terry finds a place across the room where he can watch the suspect. He seems to be paying extra attention to a pretty girl in a brown-checked shirt (Sara Carlson) who's engaged in a rowdy popcorn-throwing fight with her friends at a nearby table. Suddenly she stands up and begins to dance. She gives one of her male friends a pretend lap dance...then climbs up on a table and dances for everyone. She's good...has good moves a good body an eye-catching sheaf of light-blonde hair and a slew of gold bracelets jangling on her arm. Almost everyone in the bar cheers her on. When she finally sits down the suspect steps quietly up behind her and looks down...At this moment someone bumps the cocktail waitress (Jodi Long) and she spills her tray of drinks on Terry. She apologizes profusely tries to wipe his jacket off with her towel offers to buy him another drink...he finally agrees to get her to leave him alone. When he looks up again the suspect is gone. He goes outside...the suspect's truck is also gone. He goes back to the suspect's house and waits for him there. It's very late when he finally drives up. He tries to sneak in without waking his mother but her light goes on and she begins to scold loudly. Terry smiles a little. The suspect goes down into the basement strips and goes to bed. Terry calls it a night too and drives away.He passes emergency vehicles police medics and an ambulance parked near an alley. With a sense of foreboding. he stops and gets out to look. EMT's are lifting a body onto a gurney covering it with a plastic sheet. ""What happened?"" he asks another man standing nearby with an armload of groceries (Richard K. Olsen). ""Found a body in the dumpster"" he replies. ""Some girl."" Terry watches as they wheel the body to the ambulance. An arm slips out to one side...with a slew of gold bracelets jangling. There's a hint of that checked shirt visible under the clear plastic sheet and the swath of light blonde hair is unmistakable.Terry goes to the police the next day and tells them that he is now ready to identify Denise's attacker. They ask him why he is so sure now. He tells them that he followed him the night of the line-up to see him under more similar circumstances to confirm he was the right one. The officers are excited again. They call in State Attorney Peters (Robert Schenkkan) and ask him to get a search warrant for the suspect's home and vehicle...whose name we learn is Chris Henderson (Brad Greenquist).But the searches don't go as they'd hoped. They are unable to find any blood hair or fibers in his home or truck. They do find a handful of mint-flavored toothpicks in the glove compartment of his truck but those are available free in a number of downtown restaurants and don't provide enough of a link to the murders on their own. (""We held that back from the press"" explains Detective Quirke. ""Henderson stuck a toothpick in the locks at the apartment buildings of both the murdered girls so their keys wouldn't work and they'd have to go around to the side door."") They have called Terry in to explain all this to him and tell him that they now have no choice but to charge Henderson with Denise's assault. With Terry's help they can get him put away and while he's serving time for that they'll get lucky and find evidence to connect him to the murders.Terry meets Sylvia in the square near the Washington Monument to break the news. She is frightened and angry that the situation has progressed to this point. Terry assures her that whatever happens he won't involve her. But she doesn't trust him. ""All you've done so far is grandstand"" she says ""and I'm the one with everything to lose."" She flounces off leaving him there in the square. Denise Connelly who has been out running happens along just in time to see the back of her as she walks away. She calls to Terry and walks over to join him. She tells him it means a lot to her that he decided to come forward. This makes him feel both a little better...and a little worse.He goes home dejected but finds Sylvia waiting for him in the foyer of his apartment building. She apologizes for lashing out at him. She tells him she'll support him even go to court (secretly!) And when he testifies it will be for both of them.At the trial State Attorney Peters allows Terry to tell his story with little interruption. Confident articulate and personable he makes a splendid witness. He delivers his evidence without faltering and when he is finished he stands up to leave. ""One moment Mr. Lambert"" admonishes the judge (Penelope Allen) ""there are two attorneys present."" Everyone titters a little including Terry and he sits back down. Henderson's attorney (Wallace Shawn) steps forward and says ""Okay Mr. Lambert let's take you through this again in perhaps a little more detail."" He establishes that Terry was alone and asleep when Denise's screams awakened him that the whole incident happened very quickly. He proposes that they test Terry's eyesight under conditions similar to the night of the attack. ""And we'll start by having you remove your contact lenses"" he finishes.Terry is stunned...again he clearly hadn't counted on this. Henderson's attorney reminds him that he wears hard contact lenses which he would have removed prior to going to bed so he would have witnessed the incident without the lenses and they need to determine whether that would have been possible.Peters also taken by surprise objects...but the judge overrules him. Terry removes his contacts and the courtroom is darkened. Henderson's attorney goes to the back of the room holds up an object and asks Terry to identify it. Stumped Terry's eyes stray to Sylvia watching from the gallery as she'd promised. She tries to mime that Henderson's attorney is holding up a small red book. Henderson sees where Terry is looking and recognizes Sylvia as the woman in the bedroom window the true witness. Denise also sees where Terry is looking puts two and two together and comes to the same conclusion.Terry is unable to identify the book even after they turn the lights on in the courtroom. With his testimony discredited Henderson is acquitted. Peters is in a towering rage. The detectives are also angry...worse they are now looking suspiciously at Terry.He slinks home to hide but finds no peace there: a neighbor a middle-aged woman (Kate McGregor-Stewart) from the first floor ambushes him on the stairs. Clearly enjoying herself she tells him that the police came to ask her a lot of questions about him today. He goes on upstairs to his apartment but he's only there for a minute when there's a knock at the door: Denise is standing outside when he answers looking reproachful. ""You heard they let him go?"" he asks; she nods slowly. ""Sickening isn't it?"" he says; she nods again. ""Would you like a beer?"" he asks. ""Thanks I would"" she replies and comes inside. ""Is that the famous window?"" she asks looking into his bedroom. He nods she asks if she can have a look. He hands her a beer and they stand together looking out the window in silence for a moment. ""I know Terry"" she says. He looks at her startled and she repeats ""I know. I saw you with her in the park and I saw her today in court coaching you...it was pathetic. It was her not you who witnessed the attack and she can't come forward for some reason so you were idiot enough to come forward in her place."" Terry tries to deny it but she's not buying it. He asks her what she's going to do. She tells him she'll be waiting to see what HE does...and what SYLVIA does. She thanks him for the beer and leaves.Terry picks up the phone to call Sylvia but stops when he hears a couple of odd clicks on the line. Afraid the police are tapping his line he makes arrangements to meet her another way at the National Aquarium. He tells her Denise knows about her. He also tells her he thinks the police suspect him that they may be tapping his phone and following him. Sylvia is sure Terry is exaggerating about the police but the news about Denise upsets her. She tells him to ask her to give them more time. She still can't come forward she needs time to think. As she is leaving she makes an unkind remark about his bad eyesight. Apparently the flirtation is over.Terry goes back to Denise and asks her to hold off on going to the police. ""All right"" she says ""But I'm giving the time to you because you're the one who needs it. SHE knows EXACTLY what SHE'S doing.""When Terry comes out of his apartment building the next day Detective Jessup is waiting to take him to the precinct for another interview. The detectives aren't so friendly this time. They ask what he was doing the night of the attack then they ask about the girl from the Fells Point Saloon. They tell him that the barmaid doesn't remember seeing Henderson there but clearly remembers Terry. He is pretty shaken by all this but tries to remain cool. He asks if he is under arrest; they tell him not yet...this time they're moving more slowly. He decides enough is enough. He calls Sylvia and tells her she must go with him to the police. She is dressing to go out for the evening with Collin and she is furious he has called her at home. She hangs up on him but Collin has heard and asks who it was. She hesitates comes to a decision...replies ""Terry Lambert.""Meanwhile Terry angry and desperate drives to Sylvia's house...only to be told that the Wentworths have gone to the ballet for the evening. He drives to the theatre to talk to her there. She and Collin are sitting toward the front of the theatre in the center section. She turns sees him at the back of the theatre and goes to go talk with him. They step into the foyer and he tells her the police definitely suspect him and she's the only one who can tell them what's going on. She replies that she can't. She confessed to Collin that she had slept with him...one time only...for which Collin has forgiven her on condition that she agrees to say that she was at home that night so they are not involved further in the mess. ""So you'll have to find another solution to your problem"" she finishes. ""Sylvia there IS no other solution"" he exclaims so vehemently that one of the ushers approaches and asks Sylvia if she's ok. They are at an impasse. He stops her though as she turns to walk back into the theatre: ""Tell me one thing"" he asks ""it was him wasn't it? You were sure right from the beginning it was Henderson."" Sylvia replies in a tired voice ""All right I was sure. Of course I was sure. There's nothing wrong with MY eyes."" She goes back into the theatre and he leaves. A man standing in the back of the theatre tells her softly that the act is almost over it would be better to wait. She complies.Terry goes back to his car but as he is getting in he notices the vehicle parked behind his: an old beat-up truck...Henderson's truck. Alarmed he runs back into the theatre. He is just in time to see Henderson stab Sylvia. Henderson smiles triumphantly and shoves the dying woman toward Terry who catches her getting his shirt soaked with her blood. Collin has come back to see what's keeping Sylvia sees Terry with her lifeless body in his arms and raises the alarm. With ushers in pursuit Terry flees down onto the stage and escapes through the back of the theatre. Henderson walks calmly out the front door and no one notices.At Edgar's Sylvia's picture flashes up on one of the TVs as the socialite victim of a heinous murder. Denise asks the bartender to turn up the sound. Terry's picture is shown next as a person of interest in Sylvia's slaying. One of Denise's co-workers asks ""Isn't that the guy who.....?"" Denise nods thoughtfully.When she goes out to her car after the bar has closed someone approaches her suddenly urgently. Startled she lashes out hitting him in the face and knocking him down. It is Terry. She takes him home and sneaks him into her apartment. He tells her what happened tells her that he knew he was being followed but he'd thought it was the police. Henderson couldn't have planned it better...taking care of the one person who could accuse him and clear Terry at the same time.Denise believes him. Terry is curious about that...why she never suspected him. ""I knew something the police didn't know"" she replies. ""Even that first night at the station I knew something was wrong. It was obvious you didn't know me. You hadn't seen me from your bedroom window or anywhere else and you weren't interested. Not flattering perhaps...but on reflection trustworthy."" She asks what he's going to do. He tells her that he has no other choice he'll take his chances with the police. She tells him he can stay the night at her place and surrender in the next morning.She points out that between the two of them they probably know more about Henderson than anyone else. She asks if she and the other girl looked alike. ""Not really"" Terry replies. Denise asks ""What made him notice her in particular?"" ""Everybody noticed her"" he replies. ""She danced. She was good too she was sexy...and her friends egged her on."" He asks her with a little smile ""Did you dance the night you were attacked?"" ""On a Thursday night the place is so busy I don't have time to breathe"" she says. ""Did anything unusual happen that night?"" he persists. ""Well there was the kiss"" she says. It had been Peter the bartender's birthday (Francis V. Guinan Jr.). They had gotten him a cake and she had brought it out at midnight. She had given him a little kiss and everyone had cheered and applauded. So she'd given him another longer kiss...that brought more cheers and applause. Then he'd grabbed her and given her a really long kiss...and the crowd had gone wild. ""Two girls"" says Terry ""both young and pretty both did something that made them the center of attention. Something sexual...something that would turn a normal guy on."" Denise adds ""Turns him on too but makes him want to kill.""She asks if he loved Sylvia. He told her he probably had a crush on her but that he really hadn't known her at all...and he was just something for her to do. ""I can think of worse things to do"" says Denise and hands him a set of sheets and a blanket for the couch. Sometime in the night she comes out to him and asks him to join her in her bedroom. She tells him that she has not been able to be with a man since the attack...but tonight with him she thinks she could. He tenderly holds out his hand to her and she joins him on the couch.The next day she tells him that sooner or later Henderson will attack someone again. He replies that he'll be in jail the perfect alibi. She says they could make it happen sooner rather than later by setting a trap for him...by getting a girl who's his type to do something they know will push his buttons. Terry refuses...doesn't want to put her in danger. ""Besides"" he adds ""He'd know you know it was a set-up."" Denise dresses up in a short leather miniskirt and halter top with a hot pink jacket and stiletto heels...puts on a long auburn wig and changes her make-up. He's impressed decides maybe it could work.He calls Detectives Quirke and Jessup and tells them to wait at the precinct...he'll call and let them know where they can meet him later that night. Denise rents a car for Terry so that he can follow her and Henderson and they go to his workplace to wait for him to get off. This night of all nights he works late. And then he goes to a neighborhood pool hall to have a beer rather than going to hunt for another victim. ""Not one of your better places in town"" she says to Terry...but she musters up her courage and walks in.There are no other females there...all the blue collar guys howl and growl and catcall as she walks to the bar. She orders a beer and a bump and puts a quarter in the juke box...dances a little to the tune when it comes up. A man at the other end of the bar (Maury Chaykin) sends her another drink and invites her to play pool with him. Henderson is watching her but makes no move toward her. Terry watches him from outside through the window. At one point Henderson goes over to the bar where Denise left her jacket and purse and stares down at her open wallet on the bar. Terry realizes that he saw Henderson do this before at the Fells Point Saloon. This is how he found out where the other two girls lived. Henderson goes to the restroom...Terry comes into the bar and tells Denise what he saw and that Henderson's apparently decided to go for it. He goes back outside to call Detectives Quirke and Jessup from the phone booth on the corner.Henderson comes out of the restroom and leaves. Denise wraps up the game of pool. Her pool partner tries to put a move on her but she's had extensive experience shutting down unwanted advances. A bold grab of the ""family jewels"" and a threat to put them in the corner pocket along with the 8-ball does the job.Terry has discovered that the phone booth is in use: a transient (Mark Margolis) seems prepared to talk all night. Terry tries to persuade him to leave offers to pay him then winds up demanding that he leave. The transient ignores him at first then they start to fight. Denise comes out of the bar gets in her car and leaves. Terry calls to her to get her to stop and wait for him but she doesn't hear and he can't get away from the transient. A patrol cop (Kevin O'Rourke) pulls over to break it up. While the cop is dealing with the transient Terry steals the patrol car and heads out after Denise calling on the way for help on the police radio.Denise arrives at her apartment building and sees that Henderson's truck is parked a few stalls away. She takes a can of mace from her pocket to keep ready. She discovers that the elevator from the underground parking garage has been disabled in some way. Thinking Terry is right behind her she starts up the stairs slowly cautiously checking corners and glancing behind her from time to time. On the first floor landing she pauses looking up the next flight of stairs...and Henderson steps out from behind the door and grabs her.Terry arrives and jumps out of the cop car. He sees Henderson's truck and pauses.Denise and Henderson are struggling on the stairs....she tries to spray him but he knocks the mace out of her hand. She falls and he grabs her by the hair to drag her to her feet. He is shocked to his shoes when it comes off in his hand! He turns her over and looks at her recognizes her just as Terry appears on the landing below him. ""You!"" he growls...and Terry jumps on him. Denise is able to get clear and find the can of mace. She grabs Henderson by the hair pulls his head back and lets him have a full dose right in the eyes. He screams pulls away from Terry who also falls and makes a desperate dash for his truck. Terry checks to make sure Denise is all right then goes after him.Officers are arriving now Denise directs them to help Terry. Henderson is in his truck trying to get it started but something has been jammed in the ignition. He pulls it out and throws it away. He starts the truck but Terry is on him again...grabbing him through the open window trying to drag him out of the truck. Henderson takes off with Terry hanging off the side...they pull out of the parking garage and out onto the street. Detectives Quirke and Jessup arrive just in time for Henderson to crash into their car. Terry is thrown clear skinned and bruised but without serious injury.Later Henderson has been strapped to a gurney and loaded into an ambulance. Terry and Denise sit on the fountain at the foot of the Washington Monument and wait for the police to decide their fate. Detective Quirke approaches them looking stern and says ""You know we'd have gotten him eventually. Sooner or later we'd have muddled through. What did you put in his ignition...a toothpick?"" Terry smiles slightly. ""Paper clip"" he replies. Quirke shakes his head. ""It was a stupid move"" he remarks. ""You seemed like such a level-headed girl"" he says to Denise. ""What happens now?"" she asks. ""Well for your friend here there's still the question of perjury...obstruction of justice"" he says. ""I'd say you're looking at ten to twelve years."" Denise and Terry both look alarmed. ""Just kidding"" he says with a smile. ""Get yourself a good lawyer."" He walks off. Terry puts his arm around Denise and they smile at each other...the camera pans up to the statue of George Washington the music comes up and the credits roll."

The case is assigned to detectives Cassie 'the hyena' Mayweather who carries a sequoia-size chip on the shoulder from her previous life and her brilliant new partner Sam Kennedy who just transferred from the vice squad; they can work together very well and even fit romantically but fall out over different professional attitudes towards the investigation which Captain Rod Cody and her understandably vindictive abused ex Assistant D.A.

Richard is wealthy extroverted popular smart but an underachiever. Justin is an introverted intellectual loner. These outward appearances belie the fact that unknown to anyone that knows them they are indeed friends at least in their joint fascination with committing what they consider the perfect murder which includes framing someone else for the act. Justin is largely the planner Richard the director of executing the plan. When a young woman who is eventually identified as Olivia Lake is found murdered Richard and then Justin eventually come into the radar of San Benito homicide detective Cassie Mayweather the lead investigator in the case. Richard being identified as peripherally related to the case was always part of their plan to allow the pair to monitor the investigation. Richard and Justin expect the investigators to find the physical evidence they have left behind and piece together a story that they have concocted a path which Cassie's partner newly minted detective Sam Kennedy seems to be following. But an issue from Cassie's past which few if any of her colleagues know about and which is the reason behind her difficult but dogged nature places her drive to get Justin and particularly Richard who she is certain is the one dictating the plan are brought to justice despite the physical evidence not pointing in their direction. Richard and Justin's plan may be affected by their relationship with an unwitting third party classmate Lisa Mills. Conversely Cassie may have troubles getting the justice she wants because of her nature leading to the thought that her biases are getting in the way of seeing the evidence for what it is.

Trapped realizing there is no way out Jennifer pleads and screams to anyone that might hear her. During her confinement she is subjected to various forms of psychological and sensory torture. She is forced to drink a blended mixture of an eye ear and nose of a previous victim. Then she is made to decide who dies within 30 seconds: herself or her dog Suzy.Jennifer eventually finds she is not alone. A young man Gary (Daniel Gillies) is being held captive in an adjoining cell. The two make contact and try to find out why they are being held.After watching the horrific scene they find their way out. A fight ensues between Gary and the captor. Ultimately Jennifer is drugged once again and wakes up confined to a ""torture chair"" with Gary. Ready to pull out Jennifer's tooth Gary insists the captor take his out instead.After a moment of consensual sex Gary awakens to find Jennifer who has been drugged once again. He takes out a key to an adjoining cell.A tape is shown where a woman lying on her bed with cigarettes and pills scattered everywhere is apologizing to her son for ""touching"" him. The boy then repeatedly stabs his mother several times killing her. He then snaps a picture of his dead mother. In a little corner glancing at the photo a smirk appears on his face.Meanwhile Gary's key opens a door into a house revealing that Gary and his older brother Ben (Pruitt Taylor Vince) are actually the captors. Gary joins Ben in the kitchen where they make sushi.Gary tells Ben that he is falling in love with Jennifer. Ben strikes Gary and says ""play them don't play with them."" Ben then puts something in the fridge. When he turns around Gary stabs him. Gary then watches the same tape of the woman lying on the bed that was shown earlier. The boy stabbing his mother is revealed to have been Gary looking at a smirking Ben.After the tape Gary is seen reviewing a series of pictures in an album and then there is a knock at the door. At the sound of knocks he quickly rushes and puts the albums in a cabinet. He slams the cabinet's door but it does not fully close. The knock at the door are two detectives looking for Ben. Gary tells them that his brother is not at the house. The detectives enter the house getting comfortable and asking to watch a big sports game on TV. One of them flips the channel to the surveillance video of Jennifer sleeping. Seeing this Gary shoots them both.He runs down to where Jennifer is being held and tells her that he has killed ""them"" and that it is time to go. He places Jennifer in a room and tells her not to go. One of the detectives not dead after all jumps out at her but she bashes him with a bat believing him to be one of her captors. Jennifer then discovers the ajar cabinet and begins viewing the albums. Gary is in all of them. While looking through albums Ben also not yet dead jumps out at her. However Jennifer finishes him off by stabbing the knife more deeply into him.After viewing the albums Jennifer hears the detective's pager ring and she goes through his personal belongings. Gary is seen recording Jennifer and claims she belongs to him and will help her clean the mess up. She tricks him and sprays ammonia in his eyes before running off.On her way she cuts a series of wires and electrical cords preventing doors code entries and lights from working. Jennifer picks up a flashlight and the gun used on the detectives. She does not know how to use a gun and fails to 'cock' it. Gary then throws her on a bed and points the gun at her face explaining why the gun had not fired while firing a round into the ceiling to demonstrate and terrify her. She kicks him in the groin and retrieves the gun from him. This time she cocks the gun. Instead of then shooting him in the head she shoots him in the groin and says ""thanks"" to him. She then shoots him in the heart and exits the room. She leaves the house and the last scene shows posters of Jennifer's new film DARE.

"""Neuropsychologists say that 'we don't have one brain. We have
three--one that is human built over another that is mammalian built over
yet another that's reptilian. So when a psychiatrist asks you to lie down
on the couch you're being asked to lie down with a horse and with a
crocodile.'"" [Steven Grlscz]A wrecked car is suspended in the treetops the driver a young woman.
Investigators notice that there is no blood but they make nothing of it.
Nor do they notice her fiancé Steven Grlscz [Jude Law] among the bystanders.
Later that day Steven writes one word in his diary: despair.
While waiting for the Tube Steven saves Maria Vaughan from jumping
in front of the train. He gives her his card she calls him and they
begin a love affair. When Steven is assured that Maria has feelings for
him he takes her to his bed drinks her blood and then drives to the
coast where he disposes of her body in the sea. This time the word entered
in his diary is: disappointment.
Steven Grlscz is a vampire but far from typical. He can go out in
the sunlight eat regular food does not sleep in a coffin and has no
fangs. Yet he needs to drink blood once a month or he will die. His
favorite target is young women with whom he first develops a relationship.While touring a museum or industrial plant of some sort Steven
sketches asthmatic Anne Levels [Elina Löwensohn]. When they meet later in a cappucino
shoppe she asks to see the drawings. They exchange names and make a date
for Wednesday night. When Anne breaks the date in order to work on some
waterproof concrete (she's a structural engineer) Steven brings her
Chinese takeout. So begins the carefully choreographed relationship
between vampire and new prey.However Stephen is worried when he overhears a news broadcast about
the body of Maria Vaughan being found in a fishing net. He immediately
telephones the police probably because he knows that the trail will
eventually lead to him. Inspector Healey [Timothy Spall] and Sgt Roche [Jack Davenport] come to question
him. Steven makes up a story about not seeing Maria after they had an
argument over her wanting to marry him and him not wanting to continue the
relationship with her. Steven becomes their prime suspect and Inspector
Healey begins to tail him. One evening after Steven sees Anne off on the
train Healey is attacked by a gang of hoods who beat him and steal the
crucifix he wears around his neck. Steven intervenes and saves Healey. So
begins the carefully choreographed relationship between vampire and
detective.Meanwhile things with Anne are going nicely. In his diary Steven
describes her as confident independent witty and full of strange little
stories and sayings. Steven keeps notes on all his intendeds because the
goal is to woo their trust and love. Anne visits him where he works as a
medical researcher investigating crystals from human kidneys and bladders.
Steven contends that extreme emotional states can cause the body to form
crystals and he shows her a number of them which he names ""rage
resentment spite malice and bad temper."" When Steven and Anne are
attacked by the gang of hoods from the Tube Steven saves Anne in an
amazing show of superstrength and speed apparently some of the vampiric
qualities that he *does* possess.Anne is falling in love but Healey and Roche are still suspicious of
Steven. They question people along the route that Steven might have taken
to the seashore and find a toll collector who may remember him. Steven is
brought in for a line-up but the toll collector fingers someone else.
Steven and Healey strike up a friendship in which they confide personal
things with each other. Steven retrieves the crucifix from Healey's
attacker and returns it to Healey. When Healey learns that Steven actually
saved Maria from committing suicide he begins to doubt that Steven has it
in him to be a killer.One night Anne is in a bad mood and snaps at Steven. She immediately
apologizes but Steven leaves in a huff and hides out refusing to return
Anne's phone calls. After Anne has to perform a tracheostomy on an injured
man she admits to herself that she misses Steven and calls him. Steven
has been drawing pictures of her and admits that he misses her too. They
plan to meet at his apartment the first time that Anne has been invited
there.Steven knows that he is dying and that he needs blood. His body is
breaking down he bleeds and doesn't heal and he has to wear an alarm to
remind him to breathe while he's sleeping. It's time to feed on Anne but
when he tries he can't bring himself to kill her. Instead he explains to
her that he is a vampire who feeds on the emotions in blood. Like kidney
stones he says emotions are ""things"" carried in the blood. Some
emotions e.g. resentment malice despair and disappointment only
serve to make him sick. He prefers to feed on love. He thinks that perfect
love might cure him if he ever finds it. Could Anne be this perfect love?
Anne isn't buying it. To show his love for her Steven lets her go. He
even hands her a knife and informs her that with one cut he will bleed
to death in 20 minutes.Anne puts down the knife and rather than run she stays with him
tending him as he grows weaker and weaker bathing his eyes when he goes
temporarily blind waking him when he forgets to breathe offering to go
to the chemist when they run out of elastoplasts (bandaids). Steven is
even more convinced of Anne's love for him and as his end approaches he
knows what he must do. While Anne is at the chemist he prepares for his
dinner. When Anne realizes what he is doing she runs to the roof
intending to kill herself rather than let him kill her. As she rescinds
her love for him (""I know you for what you are...I don't love you!"") and
Steven replies ""It may not be in your heart but it's still in your
blood"" a big tear runs down his cheek.Anne jumps but Steven catches her hand just in time. She removes a
large stickpin from her hair and plunges it through Steven's hand. Still
he succeeds in pulling her back to the roof whether to save her life or
his dinner is up to you to decide. As Steven lay dying he muses. ""When I
was a boy"" he says ""I fell out of a tree but I managed just to grab a
branch. I hung there for a long time terrified the silence and the pain
in my arms and the blood pounding in my ears. And then I fell. I don't
remember what happened when I hit the ground. All I can remember now is
the agony of holding on and the wonderful feeling of letting go.""
With that Steven lets go of life and Anne walks home in tears.

"One night while driving down a dark road near Los Angeles private detective Mike Hammer (Ralph Meeker) nearly runs down a young woman named Christina (Cloris Leachman) standing in the road who begs for a ride. Hammer gives the blonde a ride thinking she may be an escaped lunatic since she is only dressed in a trenchcoat. When they confront a road block Hammer covers for the young woman after she gives him a story about some mysterious characters who are chasing her. Hammer shrugs it off until a car cuts them off and several shady men grab them kidnap Christina and run Hammer off a cliff destroying his car and putting him in the hospital. When Hammer comes around he is bent on vengeance but more on solving the mystery of who these guys are and why they killed Christina. So he begins to investigate the woman's past based on a clue that she left before she died. Hammer turns to his affectionate assistant Velda (Maxine Cooper) and Nick (Nick Dennis) his garage mechanic to track down helpful information and she finds the addresses of Christina's roommate Gabrielle (Gaby Rodgers) scientists and art dealers who all have an interesting connection to a group of thugs composed of Carl Evello (Paul Stewart) Charlie Max (Jack Elam) and Sugar Smallhouse (Jack Lambert) and a mysterious box that holds the key to the mystery. An evil doctor named Soberin (Albert Dekker) catches up with Hammer and a finale brings about tremendous happenings.======================================================This is a more detailed Synopsis.The movie opens with a woman Christina Bailey (Cloris Leachman) running down the middle of a street wearing just a trench coat. It is dark and she tries to flag down several cars with no luck. Finally in desperation she blocks the street forcing Mike Hammer (Ralph Meeker) to swerve his sports car into the soft shoulder of the road. Very annoyed he tells her to get into his car. He drives down the road. Credits roll in reverse from top to bottom to the Nat King Cole song ""Rather Have the Blues"" playing on the radio. Christina keeps looking back. She tells Mike she's heading for Los Angeles. They come to a road block. ""A woman escaped from an asylum upstate"" is the reason given by the police. Mike tells the officer his wife was asleep explaining her appearance in ""his"" trench coat in an open top roadster. Mike stops at a service station. The mechanic finds and dislodges a shrub caught in the front wheel. Christina uses the bathroom and then asks the mechanic (Robert Sherman) to mail a letter for her. They resume their journey. She tells Mike if they don't make it to her bus stop to ""remember me."" A large black Cadillac pulls out and blocks the road. Three men get out. Next we hear screaming and see a woman's legs twitching. Christina is being tortured with a pair of pliers (discreetly off camera). Mike is unconscious on a bare metal bed spring mattress. Mike awakens and learns Christina is dead. He and Christina are put in his car and pushed over a cliff. He is thrown clear before the car crashes and burns. The Cadillac pulls away.Mike wakes in a hospital room to the faces of a nurse (Mara McAfee) and his secretary Velda Wickman (Maxine Cooper). The doctor enters and tells Lt. Pat Murphy (Wesley Addy) he has five minutes. Pat asks Mike what happened. Sometime later Mike is discharged. As he leaves with Velda he is immediately detained for questioning by the Interstate Crime Commission. Pat waits outside the hearing room. FBI agents (Robert Cornthwaite and James Seay) ask Mike about his business. They are investigating Christina's death. Mike deduces Christina was involved ""in something big."" He sees a potential business opportunity.Mike takes a cab to see his mechanic Nick (Nick Dennis). He is told the car was totaled and that a couple of tough guys were looking for him. The tough guys are waiting outside Mike's apartment building when he gets home. He carefully approaches his apartment door expecting someone waiting to ambush him but the place is empty. The phone rings and the answering machine picks up; it is Velda she tells him she is on her way over. Velda arrives followed shortly by Pat--official business. Pat lets himself in. He revokes Mike's Private Investigator license and his gun permit. Mike asks Pat about a science reporter Ray Diker. Mike and Velda discuss a return to their usual business--divorce investigations.In a different sports car Mike is on his way to visit Ray Diker (Mort Marshall). He is followed by an attacker (Paul Richards). Mike gets the drop on him and easily disarms and dispatches the guy. He proceeds to Diker's apartment. It is clear the man is terrified as he shows signs of an earlier beating. He tells Mike he's afraid just like Christina. He provides Mike her last name and address. Mike drives to Christina's last known address where he gains the confidence of an old furniture mover (Silvio Minciotti). He gives Mike the current address of Christina's roommate. The apartment manager Horace (James McCallion) shows Mike the apartment. There he collects a volume of poetry by Christina Rossetti. Mike drives over to see the roommate Lilly Carver (Gaby Rodgers). She greets him with a gun. They talk. She tells Mike about Christina and the night she was taken away.In his apartment Mike gets a phone call. He lets the answering machine screen his call. A man's voice recounts the events to date; Mike picks up the phone to talk to the stranger. Mike is told if he ""forgets"" about events he will be rewarded. The next morning a brand new Corvette is parked in front of the building. Nick sees it first and gets in; he intends to drive it around the block before Mike gets there. Mike warns him in time not to touch the car--it is wired with explosives. He finds and removes the bomb but Mike tells Nick to drive slowly over to the shop to find the second bomb. Mike asks Nick to discreetly find out who planted the bombs. This little task will prove to be a fatal one.Mike stops at Velda's apartment to tell her the divorce business is a little too small time; he has something better ""That girl I picked up was mixed up in something big."" Velda tells Mike that Diker called and left two names and contacts. Leopold Kowolsky / Harvey Wallace and Nicholas Raymondo / Carmen Trivago. Velda tells Mike that Kowolsky was a pro fighter but she had nothing on Raymondo. She emphasizes ""was"" as they both knew Christina and are both dead.Mike questions Harvey Wallace (Strother Martin) at home while he and his family are eating dinner. Wallace finally admits Kowolsky was pushed in front of his truck and killed. Next on his list is the gym where Kowolsky trained. He sees an old friend and trainer Eddie Yeager (Juano Hernandez). Mike inquires about Lee Kowolsky. Eddie is shocked and scared. He tells Mike he has ""forgotten"". Two men Charlie Max (Jack Elam) and Sugar Smallhouse (Jack Lambert) told him if he said anything about Kowolsky he would be killed. Mike calls Pat at police headquarters and asks who Max and Smallhouse work for. He is told Carl Evello (Paul Stewart).At the Evello home Max and Smallhouse are playing cards and Evello is sitting by the pool having a drink and playing solitaire. Mike arrives in his new car. Evello's half sister Friday (Marion Carr) is right behind him in her car. She kisses Mike and then introduces herself. They go into the house and have a drink. Friday is what used to be called ""a very loose woman."" Evello recognizes Mike Hammer and sends Charlie and Sugar to the pool house to see him. Expertly wielding a sap or blackjack Mike coldcocks Sugar. Charlie is so surprised he exits quickly and quietly back to see his boss. Evello tells Friday to ""send him into the house."" They talk. Evello admits to placing the explosives in Mikes new car ""I'll admit that was a little crude...We keep underestimating you."" Their meeting ends on an ominous note--play ball or die.Mike drives over to see Carmen Trivago (Fortunio Bonanova). Like all his other leads this one is scared. He tells Mike ""I know nothing."" He does manage to get that whatever ""it"" is it is small and can be hidden. That evening he returns to see Lilly Carver; she is hiding on the stairs and tells Mike ""they came again last night I hid in the basement."" He takes her back to his apartment. Nick has done a little investigating earlier in the day so when Mike drops by he tells him he has some information about the car bomb. Mike still needs to secure Lilly Carver at his place so he tells Nick he will be back to talk. Nick crawls under a car to work and is killed by a man we never see. Mike gets Lilly to his apartment and tells her to lock the door and not to answer the phone. Mike drives back to Nick's garage and finds another mechanic Sammy (Jerry Zinneman) holding Nick's dead hand and sobbing. Mike leaves when he hears a police siren.Mike drives to Velda's apartment; They kiss. She asks ""what kind of trouble are you in this time?"" He tells her Nick is dead. She gives Mike another lead Dr. Soberin. The next day Mike stops at a nightclub and gets very drunk. The bartender wakes him and says ""They got Velda."" Mike drives back to the gas station and talks to the attendant. He asks if he remembers who to whom Christina addressed her letter. The attendant tells him ""Some joker named Mike."" He goes to his office and opens the letter. It only says ""Remember Me."" Charlie Max and Sugar Smallhouse are there to greet him. Sugar returns the favor with a blackjack of his own. They take Mike to a beach house in his own car. Mike makes a run for it when he gets the chance but Charlie and Sugar give him a good beating for his attempt. He wakes tied securely to a bed. A man tells Mike he will die but he can save Velda. The man drugs Mike with sodium pentothal then exits the bedroom. Mike mumbles under the influence of the drug. Carl Evello comes in to question him but gets nothing. Mike manages to work one hand free from the ropes. He calls out and Carl returns. He lures Carl over and knocks him out. Mike pretends to be Evello and summons Sugar in to kill Mike. Sugar enters the darkened room and stabs his boss thinking it is Mike. Mike kills Sugar and escapes.Mike returns home; Carver is there and dressed. Mike picks up the book of poetry and reads the sonnet ""Remember Me."" He gets a clue that something may have been inside of Christina. Mike and Lilly visit the coroner's office. The Autopsy Surgeon Doc Kennedy (Percy Helton) is corrupt and wants money for the key he found in Christina's stomach. Mike pays him but the doctor tries to welch on the deal. Mike smashes his hand in a desk drawer to get the key. It has HAC stamped on it. They drive over to the Hollywood Athletic Club. Mike has to get tough with the attendant (Leonard Mudie). The attendant tells him it is a locker key and escorts Mike to Nicholas Raymondo's locker. Inside the locker is a leather covered box that Mike notices is very hot to the touch. He opens it slightly and an intense light shines from it. It burns his wrist. He tells the attendant not to touch it. When Mike returns to the car Lilly Carver is gone.At his apartment Pat and three policemen are waiting for his return. Pat demands the key. Mike confronts Pat with Pat's complicity in all the deaths and his inability to protect all the people who were killed. When he mentions Carver he is told Carver was killed over a week ago. Then who was that woman? Pat notices the radiation burn on Mike's wrist. Mike gives Pat the key. The police depart. Mike calls the Hollywood Athletic Club but there is no answer. The locker is broken open the attendant is dead and the box is missing. That evening Mike makes another call on Ray Diker. He gets another name William Mist owner of Mist's Gallery of Modern Art. Mike breaks in but Mist (uncredited) takes a hand full of sleeping pills prescribed by Dr. G.E. Soberin. Mist is unable to tell Mike anything despite being slapped around. Mike does manage to get Soberin's location through his answering service. On a hunch he goes to the beach cottage and recognizes the place from his encounter with Evello Charlie and Sugar.Dr. Soberin (Albert Dekker) is packing to leave. He talks to Lilly Carver whose real name is Gabrielle and we learn she was employed by Soberin to get the key from Christina and keep an eye on Mike Hammer. Gabrielle wants her share half and before Soberin leaves. When Soberin brushes her off she kills the doctor. With his dying breath he begs her not to open the box. Mike enters the room and gets a bullet for his trouble. He demands to know where Velda is located. Gabrielle opens the box and is immediately consumed by fire. Mike comes to and exits the room. He finds Velda in a locked bedroom frees her and they leave the house. They run along the beach occasionally looking back at the strobe effects lighting up the house and beach. They make their way into the surf as the house explodes. We close with Mike and Velda in the surf watching the house disintegrate."

"A white background. Red drops begin to fall past the opening credits. The drops become a red sauce on a plate. A slab of meat is cut with a knife and garnished with raspberries then placed on a table. The camera moves over various dishes most of which are very small and look very expensive. The restaurant is furnished in pinks and greens and everyone is well-dressed. Waiters tell customers ridiculously decadent specials like squid ravioli and swordfish meatloaf.The setting is New York City sometime in the 1980s. The vice-presidents of Pierce and Pierce a Wall Street financial institution are seated around a table. They include Timothy Bryce (Justin Theroux) Craig McDermott (Josh Lucas) David Van Paten (Bill Sage) and Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale). Bryce says ""This is a chick's restaurant. Why aren't we at Dorsia?"" McDermott replies ""Because Bateman won't give the maitre d' head."" Bateman flicks a toothpick at him. They discuss various people in the restaurant including who Bateman believes to be Paul Allen across the room. Van Paten returns from the bathroom and says that there's no good place to do coke in. They discuss the fact that Allen is handling the Fisher account which leads McDermott to make racist remarks about Allen being Jewish. ""Jesus McDermott what does that have to do with anything?"" says Patrick. ""I've seen that bastard sitting in his office spinning a fucking menorah."" Bateman rebukes him. ""Not a menorah. A dreidel you spin a dreidel."" McDermott replies ""Do you want me to fry you up some potato pancakes? Some latkes?"" ""No just cool it with the anti-Semitic remarks."" ""Oh I forgot. Bateman's dating someone from the ACLU!"" Bryce calls Bateman the voice of reason. Looking at the check he remarks ""Speaking of reasonable only $570."" They all drop their Platinum American Express cards on top of the bill.At a nightclub Bryce takes some money out of a clip and gives it to a man in drag who lets them inside. As some 80's pop music plays from overhead the men dance while strobe lights flash and some women on stage wave around prop guns like something out of a grind house flick. Bateman orders a drink and hands the bartender a drink ticket but she tells him drink tickets are no good and that he has to pay in cash. He pays and then when she's out of earshot he says ""You're a fucking ugly bitch. I want to stab you to death then play around with your blood."" He takes his drink with a smile.The camera pans through Bateman's apartment the next morning. Everything is shades of white with black counters and shelves. It is sparsely decorated but looks expensive. ""I live in the American Gardens building on West 81st street on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I'm 27 years old."" He describes his diet and exercise routine and his meticulous daily grooming rituals which involves no less than 9 different lotions and cleansers. ""There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman"" he says while peeling off his herb-mint facial mask. ""Some kind of abstraction. But there is no 'real me'. Only an entity. Something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable I simply am not there.""Sweeping over the skyline of downtown New York the song Walking on Sunshine starts playing. Walking down the hallway to his office Bateman listens to this song on his headphones with absolutely no expression on his face. Someone passes by him and says ""Hey Hamilton. Nice tan."" Everyone in the hallway has expensive suits and slicked-back hair. He walks by his secretary Jean (Chloe Sevigny) to his office door. She's dressed in a long coat and shirt that are too big for her. ""Aerobics class sorry. Any messages?"" She follows him into his corner office. She tells him someone cancelled but she doesn't know what he cancelled or why. ""I occasionally box with him at the Harvard Club."" She tells him someone named Spencer wants to meet for drinks. He tells her to cancel it. ""What should I say?"" ""Just say no."" He tells her to make reservations for him at a restaurant for lunch as well as dinner reservations at Arcadia on Thursday. ""Something romantic?"" ""No silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Just get me a mineral water."" She tells him he looks nice. Without looking at her he tells her not to wear that outfit. ""Wear a dress or a skirt. You're prettier than that."" The phone starts ringing and he tells her to tell anyone who calls that he isn't there. ""And high heels."" She leaves. He puts his feet up and starts watching Jeopardy on his office TV.A taxicab makes its way through Chinatown. Inside Bateman is trying to listen to the new Robert Palmer album on his headphones but his ""supposed"" fiancée Evelyn (Reese Witherspoon) keeps distracting him with ideas for their wedding. He says he can't take the time off work to get married. ""Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like silly. You hate that job anyway I don't see why you don't just quit."" ""Because... I want... to fit... IN."" The cab drives up to a restaurant called Espace. ""I'm on the verge of tears as we arrive since I'm positive we won't have a decent table. But we do and relief washes over me in an awesome wave."" Bryce it already seated next to two punk-rock teens smoking cigarettes. ""This is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend Stash"" says Evelyn. Bryce kisses Evelyn on both cheeks and then starts kissing her neck slightly crossing the line. Bateman looks at his blurry reflection in a metal menu. As they eat sushi he remarks ""I'm fairly certain that Timothy Bryce and Evelyn are having an affair. Timothy is the only interesting person I know."" Bateman doesn't care because he's also having an affair with Courtney Rawlinson her best friend. ""She's usually operating on one or more psychiatric drugs tonight I believe it's Xanax."" She's also engaged to Luis Carruthers ""the biggest doofus in the business."" Courtney and Luis are seated beside him and Courtney slurring her words asks Stash whether he thinks Soho is becoming too commercial. ""Yes. I read that"" says Luis. ""Oh who gives a rat's ass"" says Bryce. ""That affects us"" says Vanden. ""What about the massacres in Sri Lanka honey? Don't you know that the Sikhs are killing like tons of Israelis over there?"" Bateman tells him there are more important problems to worry about than Sri Lanka. He tells them they include Apartheid nuclear arms terrorism and world hunger. ""We have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while also promoting equal right for women. We have to encourage a return to traditional moral values. Most importantly we have to promote general social concern and less materialism in young people."" Bryce almost chokes on his drink as he starts laughing. ""Patrick how thought-provoking"" Luis says feigning tears. Patrick takes a swig of his whiskey.It's nighttime. Patrick takes some money out of an ATM. A woman walks by and he starts following her. They stop at a crosswalk and he says ""hello"". She hesitantly says hello back. The sign changes to walk and they cross the street.The next day Bateman argues with an old Chinese woman who runs a dry cleaners. Another Chinese man is looking at some bed sheets with a huge red stain on them. Bateman is trying to tell her that you can't bleach that type of sheet and that they are very expensive. She continues to babble in a language he can't understand. ""Lady if you don't shut your fucking mouth I will kill you."" She is shocked but still won't speak English. ""I can't understand you! You're a fool! Stupid bitch-ee!"" A woman comes in the door and recognizes him. Her name is Victoria. He says hi to her. ""It's so silly to come all the way up here"" she says ""but they really are the best."" ""Then why can't they get these stains out?"" he says showing her the sheets. ""Can you get through to them? I'm getting nowhere."" ""What are those?"" she says looking wide-eyed at the stains. ""Uh well it's cranberry juice. Cran-apple."" She looks skeptical. He tells her he has a lunch date in 15 minutes and she tries to make plans with him. He tells her he's booked solid. ""What about Saturday?"" ""Next Saturday? Can't. Matinee of Les Mis."" He promises to call her and then leaves.Patrick paces his apartment in his underwear on the phone with Courtney Rawlinson (Samantha Mathis). A porno movie is playing on his TV. ""You're dating Luis he's in Arizona. You're fucking me and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight?"" She says she's waiting for Luis to call. ""Pumpkin you're dating an asshole. Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York. Pumpkin you're dating a tumbling tumbling dickweed."" She tells him to stop calling her pumpkin. He insists that they have dinner and when she says no he says he can get them a table at Dorsia. This perks her interest. He tells her to wear something nice. He calls the restaurant and asks if he can make a reservation for two at 8:00 or 8:30. There is a moment of silence on the other end of the phone then the man on the other end starts laughing uncontrollably. Patrick hangs up.In a limo Patrick listens to Courtney describe her day while she is almost passing out from her medication. ""Is that Donald Trump's car?"" he asks looking out the window. Patrick's face is blurred through the plastic divider of the limo. She tells him to shut up. He tells her to take some more lithium or coke or caffeine to get her out of her slump. ""I just want a child"" she says absently looking out the window. ""Just two... perfect... children.""At the restaurant she nearly falls asleep at the table and Patrick touches her shoulder and wakes her up. ""Are we here?"" she asks sleepily. ""Yeah"" he says sitting down. ""This is Dorsia?"" ""Yes dear"" he says opening the menu which clearly says Barcadia across it. He tells her she's going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. ""New York Matinee called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish. You'll love it."" He orders her the red snapper with violets and pine nuts to follow. She thanks him and then passes out in her chair.A conference table at P&P the next day. Luis thanks Patrick for looking after Courtney. ""Dorsia how impressive. How on Earth did you get a reservation there?"" ""Lucky I guess"" replies Patrick. Luis compliments him on his suit. ""Valentino Couture?"" ""Uh-huh."" Luis tries to touch it but Patrick slaps his hand away. ""Your compliment was sufficient Luis."" Paul Allen comes up to them. ""Hello Halberstram. Nice tie. How the hell are ya?"" Narrating Patrick explains that Allen has mistaken him for ""this dickhead Marcus Halberstram."" They both work at P&P and do the same exact work and wear the same glasses and suits. ""Marcus and I even go to the same barber. Although I have a slightly better haircut."" Allen and Patrick discuss accounts. He asks him about Cecilia Marcus' girlfriend. ""She's great I'm very lucky"" replies Patrick. Bryce and McDermott come in congratulating Allen on the Fisher account. ""Thank you Baxter."" Bryce asks him if he wants to play squash. Allen gives him his card out of his case. An audible tremor goes through the room. ""Call me."" ""How about Friday?"" says Bryce. ""No can do. I got an 8:30 rez at Dorsia. Great sea urchin seviche."" He leaves. Bryce wonders how he managed to swing that. McDermott thinks he's lying. Bateman takes out his new business card which reads ""Patrick BATEMAN - Vice President"". ""What do you think?"" ""Very nice"" says McDermott. ""I picked them up from the printers yesterday."" ""Nice coloring"" says Bryce. ""That's 'bone'. And the lettering is something called 'silian rail'."" ""Cool Bateman. But that's nothing"" says Van Paten laying his card down next to Patrick's. ""That is really nice"" says Bryce. ""Eggshell with romalian type. What do you think?"" Van Paten asks Patrick. ""Nice"" Patrick says visibly jealous. ""How did a nitwit like you get so tasteful?"" says Bryce. Biting his nails Patrick can't believe Bryce prefers Van Paten's card. ""You ain't seen nothing yet"" says Bryce taking out his own card. ""Raised lettering pale nimbus white."" Another tremor goes through the room. Holding back his rage Bateman tells him it's very nice. ""Let's see Paul Allen's card."" Bryce takes it out of his pocket and hands it to Bateman. It shines with an ethereal glow in the dim light of the conference room even though it is basically identical to the rest of their cards. Narrating Patrick says ""Look at the subtle off-white coloring. The tasteful thickness of it. Oh my God. It even has a watermark!"" He drops the card on the table. ""Something wrong?"" asks Luis. ""Patrick? You're sweating.""Nighttime. Patrick walks by a courthouse on his way home. Steam rises from underground vents. He walks through an alley a black shadow under a pale streetlight. He stops and looks behind him to see a homeless man by some piles of trash. ""Hello. Pat Bateman. Do you want some money? Some food?"" He starts taking out some money. ""I'm hungry"" says the bum. ""It's cold out too isn't it? If you're so hungry why don't you get a job?"" The bum says he lost his job. ""Why? Were you drinking? Insider trading? Just joking."" He asks him his name and the bum says his name is Al. ""Get a god-damn job Al! You have a negative attitude. That's what's stopping you."" He promises to help him get his act together. Al tells him he's a kind man. He puts his hand on Patrick's arm and Patrick pulls it off visibly disgusted. ""You know how bad you smell? You reek of shit. You know that?"" He laughs and then apologizes. ""I don't have anything in common with you."" He bends down and opens his briefcase. ""Oh thank you mister thank you. It's cold out here..."" ""You know what a fucking loser you are?"" Patrick suddenly takes a knife out of the briefcase and stabs the bum three times in the stomach than pushes the shocked man to the ground. The dog barks at Patrick so he stomps it with his foot hard enough to kill it. He picks up his briefcase and walks away down the alley.A health spa. A young Asian woman rubs some lotion on Patrick's face. She compliments him on his smooth skin. Later another Asian woman gives him a manicure. ""I have all the characteristics of a human being. Flesh. Blood. Skin. Hair. But not a single clear identifiable emotion except for greed and disgust. Something horrible is happening inside me and I don't know why."" He is lying in a tanning bed now. ""My nightly bloodlust has overflowed into my days. I feel lethal on the verge of frenzy. I think my mask of sanity is about to slip.""A Christmas party. A short man in an elf costume hands out glasses of champagne. 'Deck The Halls' is playing in the background. Patrick takes one scowling at the bizarre costumes. Someone comes up to him and calls him by the wrong name. ""Hey Hamilton. Have a holly-jolly Christmas"" says Patrick. ""Is Allen still handling the Fisher account?"" He points to Paul Allen across the room. ""Of course. Who else?"" Evelyn comes up to them. ""Mistletoe alert! Merry X-mas Patrick. You're late honey."" ""I've been here the entire time you just didn't see me."" A man behind him puts cloth antlers on Patrick's head without him noticing. ""Say hello to Snowball. Snowball says 'hello Patrick'"" she says in a childish voice. ""What is it?"" Patrick looks with disgust at the creature in her arms. ""It's a little baby piggy-wiggy isn't it? It's a Vietnamese potbellied pig. They make darling pets. Don't you? Don't you?"" Patrick looks ready to vomit as she pets the animal. ""Stop scowling Patrick. You're such a Grinch. What does Mr. Grinch want for Christmas? And don't say breast implants again."" Ignoring her he goes to mingle with the rest of the party. 'Joy to the World' is playing. He says hi to Paul Allen. ""Hey Marcus. Merry Christmas how've you been. Workaholic I suppose?"" He calls to Hamilton that they are going to Nell's bar and that the limo is out front. Patrick says that they should have dinner. Paul suggests that he bring Cecilia. ""Cecilia would adore it."" ""Then let's do it Marcus."" Evelyn comes up to them. Paul compliments her on the party and then walks away. ""Why is he calling you Marcus?"" asks Evelyn. Ignoring this Patrick says ""Mistletoe alert!"" and kisses her while waving a leafy branch.A restaurant. Most of the tables are empty. Patrick takes his reservation under the name Marcus Halberstram. He is led to a table where Paul is already seated and he is arguing with a waiter. ""I ordered the cilantro crawfish gumbo which is of course the only excuse one could have for being at this restaurant which is by the way almost completely empty."" Patrick ignores this and orders a J&B straight and a Corona. The waiter who looks slightly effeminate and has a red bandana around his neck starts to list the specials but Paul cuts him off and orders a double Absolut martini. ""Yes sir. Would you like to hear the specials?"" ""Not if you want to keep your spleen"" says Patrick. The waiter leaves. ""This is a real beehive of activity Halberstram. This place is hot very hot"" Paul comments sarcastically. ""The mud soup and charcoal arugula are outrageous here"" replies Patrick. Paul derides him for being late. ""I'm a child of divorce give me a break. I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime Jell-o."" Paul says he could have gotten them a table at Dorsia instead. ""Nobody goes there anymore. Is that Ivana Trump?"" Patrick says looking behind him. ""Oh geez Patrick. I mean Marcus. What are you thinking? Why would Ivana be at Texarkana?"" He asks how Paul ended up getting the Fisher account. ""Well I could tell you that Halberstram... but then I'd have to kill ya!"" He laughs. Patrick simply stares at him with a vicious smile.They pick at their meals. Patrick says ""I like to dissect girls. Did you know I'm utterly insane?"" Paul doesn't seem to hear him. He compliments him on his tan. When Patrick says he goes to a salon Paul says he has a tanning bed at home. ""You should look into it."" Patrick can barely suppress his rage. Paul asks about Cecilia. ""I think she's having dinner with Evelyn Williams."" ""Evelyn! Great ass. She goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman what a dork!"" Patrick chuckles with inner contempt. ""Another martini Paul?""Patrick's apartment. Paul lounges drunk on a chair with a bottle of liquor on the floor beside him. Newspapers are taped to the floor of the living room. Patrick picks up a CD. ""Do you like Huey Lewis and the News?"" ""They're OK"" says Paul. Patrick continues ""Their early work was a little too new wave for my tastes but when 'Sports' came out in '83 I think they really came into their own. Commercially and artistically."" He goes to the bathroom and puts on a raincoat. ""The whole album has a clear crisp sound and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost!"" He takes a valium washes it down looks at himself in the mirror and walks back into the living room. On his way back he grabs an axe. Moonwalking backwards he says that Huey has been compared to Elvis Costello but that Huey has a more cynical sense of humor. He puts the axe down and starts buttoning up the raincoat behind Paul. ""Hey Halberstram"" says Paul. ""Why are there copies of the Style section all over the floor? Do you have a dog? A little chow or something?"" He laughs. ""No Allen."" ""Is that a raincoat?"" ""Yes it is!"" He goes over to the CD player and presses a button. The song 'Hip to Be Square' starts playing. ""In '87 Huey released this Fore their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece is 'Hip to Be Square'."" He dances over to the kitchen where he left the axe. ""The song is so catchy most people probably don't listen to the lyrics but they should because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of trends it's also a personal statement about the band itself! Hey Paul!"" Paul looks around too late to see Patrick charge at him with the axe. Screaming he swings it into Paul's head splattering blood all over his own face. Paul falls to the floor pouring blood all over the newspapers. Patrick yells ""Try getting a reservation at Dorsia now you fucking stupid bastard!"" He swings it down again and again screaming decapitating him. ""You... fucking... bastard!"" He finally drops the axe and begins composing himself. He takes off the raincoat. He fixes his hair and lights up a cigar. 'Hip to Be Square' continues to play from the stereo.Patrick drags the body through the lobby of his building in a black bag. A trail of blood pours from the bottom of the bag. The doorman looks up at him and then goes back to writing something. Patrick hails a cab outside and starts stuffing the bag into the trunk. A voice says his name from the sidewalk. It's Luis. ""Patrick. Is that you?"" ""No Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken."" He introduces Patrick to an attractive Asian woman. ""We're going to Nell's. Gwendolyn's father is buying it. Ooh. Where did you get that overnight bag?"" He eyes the bag with the corpse inside it. ""Jean-Paul Gaultier."" Patrick slams the trunk and heads off.Later he arrives at Paul's apartment. ""I almost panic when I realize that Paul's place overlooks the park and is obviously more expensive than mine."" He finds his suitcases and starts to pack. ""It's time for Paul to take a little trip."" He throws some clothes in a suitcase and then goes to the answering machine. In his best imitation of Paul's voice he records ""It's Paul. I've been called away to London for a few days. Meredith I'll call you when I get back. Hasta la vista baby."" He takes the suitcase and leaves.In his office the next day Patrick listens to the song 'The Lady in Red' by Chris De Burgh on his headphones. Jean comes in and tells him that there's someone named Donald Kimball there to see him. ""Who?"" ""Detective Donald Kimball."" He looks through the office window. ""Tell him I'm at lunch."" ""Patrick it's only 10:30. I think he knows you're here."" ""Send him in I guess"" he says resignedly. Jean goes to get him. Patrick picks up the phone and starts having a pretend conversation with someone giving him advice on clothes and salons. ""Always tip the stylist fifteen percent. Listen John I've gotta go. T. Boone Pickens just walked in. Heh just joking. No don't tip the owner of the salon. Right. Got it."" He hangs up and apologizes to Kimball. ""No I'm sorry I should have made an appointment. Was that anything important?"" Patrick gives a vague synopsis of the call. ""Mulling over business problems examining opportunities exchanging rumors spreading gossip."" They introduce themselves to each other and shake hands. Kimball apologizes again for barging in. Patrick stuffs some magazines and his walkman into a desk drawer. ""So what's the topic of discussion?"" Kimball explains that Meredith hired him to investigate the disappearance of Paul Allen. ""I just have some basic questions."" Patrick offers him coffee which he turns down. He offers him a bottle of water which he also turns down. Bateman presses the intercom button anyways and tells Jean to bring some water. ""It's no problem."" He asks what the topic of discussion is again and Kimball repeats he's investigating the disappearance of Paul Allen. Jean comes in with a bottle and Patrick quickly puts a coaster down before she can put it on the desk. He tells Kimball he hasn't heard anything. ""I think his family wants this kept quiet."" ""Understandable. Lime?"" offers Bateman. Kimball insists he's ok. He asks Patrick his age where he went to school and his address the American Gardens building which Kimball says is very nice. ""Thanks"" Patrick says smugly. Kimball asks what he knew about Paul Allen. ""I'm at a loss. He was part of that whole Yale thing."" Kimball asks him what he means. ""Well I think for one that he was probably a closet homosexual who did a lot of cocaine. That Yale thing."" Kimball asks what kind of person Paul was. ""I hope I'm not being cross-examined here."" ""You feel like that?"" ""No. Not really."" Kimball asks where Paul hung out. Patrick names some places including a yacht club. ""He had a yacht?"" ""No he just hung out there."" ""And where did he go to school?"" ""Don't you know this?"" ""I just wanted to know if you know."" Patrick tells him St. Paul's then says he just wants to help. ""I understand."" Patrick asks if he has any witnesses or fingerprints. Kimball tells him about the message on the answering machine and that Meredith doesn't think he went to London. ""Has anyone seen him in London?"" ""Actually yes. But I'm having a hard time getting actual verification."" He tells him that someone thought they saw Paul there but mistook someone else for him. Patrick asks whether the apartment had been burglarized. Kimball tells him about the missing luggage. Patrick asks whether the police had become involved yet but Kimball says no. ""Basically no-one's seen or heard anything. It's just strange. One day someone's walking around going to work alive and then..."" ""Nothing."" ""People just disappear"" says Kimball with a sigh. Bateman says ""The earth just... opens up and swallows them."" ""Eerie. Really eerie."" Bateman excuses himself by telling Kimball he has a lunch appointment with Cliff Huxtable at the Four Seasons in 20 minutes. ""The Four Seasons? Isn't that a little far up town? I mean aren't you going to be late?"" ""No there's one down here."" Patrick promises to call him if he hears anything and shows him the door.Patrick does stomach crunches while watching The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and then does some jump-rope.Nighttime. A seedy part of town. A blonde woman in a blue coat a hooker stands in front of a warehouse on a street corner. She has a face that says she's been hooker for too long. A limousine drives up. Patrick rolls the window down as the car stops in front of her. ""I haven't seen you around here"" he tells her. ""Well you just haven't been looking."" ""Would you like to see my apartment?"" She is reluctant. He holds out some money and asks again. ""I'm not supposed to but I can make an exception"" she says taking the money. ""Do you take a credit card? Just joking."" He opens the door and invites her in. The car drives away.Patrick makes a phone call on a large cordless phone. ""I'd like a girl early 20's blonde who does couples. And I really can't stress blonde enough. Blonde."" He hangs up. He tells her his name is Paul Allen and that he's going to call her Christie. ""You'll respond only to Christie is that clear?"" She nods.Patrick's apartment. Patrick pours some mineral water into a bathtub where Christie is bathing and drinking champagne. ""That's a very fine chardonnay you're drinking."" The song 'If You Don't Know Me by Now' is playing in the background. Patrick is dressed in a suit and bow tie. ""I want you to clean your vagina"" he tells her. She puts down the champagne and picks up a bath sponge. ""From behind. Get on your knees."" He tells her she has a nice body playfully splashing her with water. The phone rings. It's the second girl in the lobby downstairs. He tells the doorman to send her up. He tells Christie to dry off and choose a robe then come to the living room.He opens the door for the second girl and takes her coat. ""I'm Paul. Not quite blonde are you? More like dirty blonde. I'm going to call you Sabrina. I'm Paul Allen."" He asks both girls if they want to know what he does for a living. They both say no lewdly. ""Well I work on Wall Street. At Pierce and Pierce. Have you heard of it?"" Sabrina shakes her head and Patrick clenches his jaw. ""You have a really nice place here Paul"" says Christie. ""How much did you pay for it?"" ""Well actually Christie that's none of your business. But I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap."" Sabrina starts to take out a cigarette. ""No! No smoking in here."" He offers them chocolate truffles. ""I don't want to get you drunk but uh that's a very fine chardonnay you're not drinking."" He goes over to the stereo and puts on a Phil Collins CD. ""I've been a big Genesis fan ever since the release of their 1980 album 'Duke'. Before that I really didn't understand any of their work. It was too artsy. Too intellectual. It was on Duke where Phil Collin's presence became more apparent."" He goes and stands in the doorway of the bedroom invitingly. ""I think Invisible Touch is the group's undisputed masterpiece."" The girls follow him into the bedroom. ""It's an epic meditation on intangibility. At the same time it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three albums."" He tells Christie to take off the robe which she does. ""Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks Collins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance of each instrument"" he says setting up a video camera on a tripod. He tells Sabrina to remove her dress. ""In terms of lyrical craftsmanship and sheer songwriting this album hits a new peak of professionalism. Sabrina why don't you dance a little? Take the lyrics to 'Land of Confusion'. In this song Phil Collins addresses the abuse of political authority. 'In Too Deep' is the most moving pop song of the 1980s"" he continues wrapping a scarf around Christie's neck while Sabrina dances in her lingerie. ""About monogamy and commitment. The song is extremely uplifting. Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything I've heard in rock."" He turns the camera on and points it towards the bed. ""Christie get down on your knees so Sabrina can see your asshole. Phil Collin's solo career seems to be more commercial and therefore more satisfying in a narrower way. Especially songs like 'In the Air Tonight' and 'Against All Odds'. Sabrina don't just stare at it eat it. But I also think Phil Collins works better within the confines of the group than as a solo artist. And I stress the word 'artist'."" He goes to the stereo and switches CDs. ""This is 'Sussudio' a great great song. A personal favorite."" He walks back to the bedroom unbuttoning his shirt.He has sex with both women at once. He flexes his muscles and admires himself in the mirror while doing them doggy-style. He makes them look into the camera. They do oral sex then missionary. Patrick flexes his muscles in the mirror again. Christie rolls her eyes. They do more doggy-style.Patrick sleeps with a woman on either side of him. He awakens some time later. Christie's arm touches his. ""Don't touch the watch."" He gets up and goes over to the dresser. The women get up and start to dress. He opens a drawer to reveal a collection of scissors carving tools and other sharp objects. He takes out a coat hanger. ""Can we go now?"" asks Christie. ""We're not through yet.""Some time later he pays them and shows them the door. They take the money quickly and appear to be in tears. Sabrina's nose is bleeding. They leave and he closes the door behind them.McDermott Van Paten and Bateman are seated in a bar lounge with drinks in front of them discussing women. ""If they have a good personality and they are not great looking who fucking cares?"" says McDermott. ""Well let's just say hypothetically what if they have a good personality?"" replies Bateman. There is a moment of silence and then all three men burst out laughing. ""There are no girls with good personalities!"" they say in unison high-fiving each other. Van Paten says ""A good personality consists of a chick with a little hard body who will satisfy all sexual demands without being too slutty about things and who will essentially keep her dumb fucking mouth shut."" McDermott continues: ""The only girls with good personalities who are smart or maybe funny or halfway intelligent or talented though god knows what the fuck that means are ugly chicks."" Van Paten agrees. ""And this is because they have to make up for how fucking unattractive they are."" Bateman asks them if they know what Ed Gein said about women. Van Paten: ""Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?"" ""No. Serial killer. Wisconsin. The 50's."" ""What did Ed say?"" ""He said 'When I see a pretty girl walking down the street I think two things. One part wants me to take her out talk to her be real nice and sweet and treat her right.'"" McDermott: ""And what did the other part of him think?"" ""What her head would look like on a stick!"" Bateman laughs heartily but Van Paten and McDermott just look at each other nervously. Luis comes up to their table and says hello. He takes out his new business card and asks their opinion on it. It is a nice looking card with gold lettering. Van Paten says it looks nice. McDermott is uninterested. Bateman swallows as a dramatic crescendo of music starts. Luis leaves and walks up the stairs. Bateman watches him go and Luis gives him look back over his shoulder. Van Paten asks about dinner. ""Is that all you ever have to contribute?"" snaps Bateman. ""Fucking dinner?"" McDermott tells him to cheer up. ""What's the matter? No shiatsu this morning?"" Bateman pushes his hand away as he tries to touch his shoulder. ""Do that again and you'll draw back a stub."" McDermott tells him ""Hang on there little buddy"" but Bateman stands up and goes up the stairs behind Luis.Putting on his leather gloves he enters a bathroom with nice wallpaper and gold mirrors. He slowly walks up behind Luis who is using a urinal. Hands shaking he slowly puts his fingers around Luis' neck. Luis turns around looks at Patrick's hands takes off one of his gloves and plants a kiss on the back of his hand. ""God. Patrick why here?"" Patrick is too shocked to say anything and he can't bring himself to kill Luis. ""I've seen you looking at me. I've noticed your... hot body"" Luis says rubbing a finger over Patrick's mouth. ""Don't be shy. You can't imagine how long I've wanted this ever since that Christmas party at Arizona 206. You know the one where you were wearing that red striped paisley Armani tie..."" Patrick walks over to the sink in a daze and starts washing his hands with his gloves still on. He looks like he's about to cry. Luis walks up behind him. ""I want you. I want you too!"" Patrick starts walking towards the door. ""Patrick?"" ""WHAT IS IT?"" he yells. ""Where are you going?"" ""I've got to return some videotapes.""He rushes down the stairs. He runs into a man holding a tray of glasses. Looking up the stairs he sees Luis make a 'call me' gesture with his hand. He leaves without saying a word to McDermott or Van Paten.Patrick walks down the hall to his office. He stops. Kimball is leaning over Jean's desk talking to her about any reservations Paul Allen might have made. ""I've been wanting to talk with you come into my office"" Patrick says shaking his hand. ""Jean. Great jacket. Matsuda?""Inside his office. ""Do you remember where you were the night of Paul's disappearance?"" asks Kimball. ""Which was on the 20th of December."" ""God. I guess I was probably returning videotapes."" He looks at his datebook. ""I had a date with a girl named Veronica."" ""That's not what I've got"" says Kimball. ""What?"" ""That's not the information I've received."" ""What information have you received? I could be wrong."" ""When was the last time you were with Paul Allen?"" ""We'd gone to a new musical called 'Oh Africa Brave Africa'. It was laugh riot. That was about it. I think we had dinner. I hope I've been informative. Long day. I'm a bit scattered."" ""I'm a bit scattered too. How about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all of this information?"" Patrick says okay. Kimball asks him to sort out exactly where he was on the night of the disappearance. ""Absolutely. I'm with you on that one."" Kimball takes a CD out of his briefcase. ""Huey Lewis and the News! Great stuff! I just bought it on my way over here! Have you heard it?"" Patrick is stunned and terrified of possibly becoming friends with this man. ""Never. I mean I don't really like singers."" ""Not a big music fan huh?"" ""No I like music just they're... Huey's too black sounding for me."" ""To each his own."" Kimball closes his briefcase. ""So lunch next week?"" ""I'll be there.""Patrick and Courtney are having sex. Patrick orgasms then rolls off her. He pulls a stuffed black cat from underneath himself putting it on Courtney's lap. He gets off the bed and starts getting dressed in front of a mirror. ""Will you call me before Easter?"" she asks. ""Maybe."" ""What are you doing tonight?"" ""Dinner at uh River Cafe."" ""That's nice"" she says lighting a cigarette. ""I never knew you smoked."" ""You never noticed. Listen Patrick can we talk?"" ""You look... marvelous. There's nothing to say"" he says shutting her out. ""You're going to marry Luis."" ""Isn't that special... Patrick? If I don't see you before Easter have a nice one okay?"" she asks with a hint of depression in her voice. ""You too."" He starts to leave. ""Patrick?"" ""Yeah?"" ""Nothing..."" He leaves.A club. Androgynous men and women pack the dance floor. The song 'Pump up the Volume' is playing. Bryce is telling Bateman about STDs while in line to use private stalls for drugs. ""There's this theory now that if you can catch the AIDS virus by having sex with someone who is infected you can catch anything. Alzheimer's muscular dystrophy hemophilia leukemia diabetes dyslexia!"" ""I'm not sure but I don't think dyslexia is a disease"" says Bateman. ""But who knows? They don't know that. Prove it."" Bryce snorts some white powder. ""Oh God. It's a fucking milligram of sweetener."" Patrick sniffs some. ""I want to get high off this not sprinkle it on my fucking oatmeal."" ""It's definitely weak but I have a feeling if we do enough of it we'll be okay"" says Bateman. Someone leans over the divider. ""Could you keep it down? I'm trying to do drugs!"" ""Fuck you!"" says Bryce. Bateman tells him to calm down. ""We'll do it anyway."" ""That is if the faggot in the next STALL thinks it's okay!"" ""Fuck you!"" says the man. ""Fuck YOU!"" says Bryce. ""Sorry dude. Steroids. Okay let's do it.""A club balcony. The song 'What's On Your Mind' is playing. Three blonde women are seated across from Patrick. One of them asks where Craig went. Bryce tells them Gorbachev is downstairs and McDermott went to sign a peace treaty. ""He's the one behind Glasnost."" Bryce makes a 'he went to get cocaine' gesture to Bateman by tapping his nose. ""I thought he was in mergers and acquisitions"" she says. ""You're not confused are you?"" asks Bryce. ""No not really."" Another woman says ""Gorbachev is NOT downstairs."" ""Karen's right Gorbachev is not down stairs. He's at Tunnel."" Bateman tells one of the girls to ask him a question. ""So what do you do?"" ""I'm into uh well murders and executions mostly."" ""Do you like it?"" ""Well that depends why?"" ""Well most guys I know who work in mergers and acquisitions really don't like it."" He asks her where she works out.On the street Patrick and the girl are talking. ""You think I'm dumb don't you. You think all models are dumb."" ""No. I really don't."" ""That's okay. I don't mind. There's something sweet about you."" They both get in the back of a cab. Somewhere a car alarm is going off.Patrick is lounging on the sofa in his office. He has sunglasses on. Between his fingers is a lock of blonde hair. Jean knocks on his door and he quickly stuffs the hair into his shirt pocket. He picks up a paper and starts twirling a pen. She enters slowly wearing a baggy brown coat and beige shirt. ""Doin' the crossword?"" she asks. Every line of the crossword is filled in with either 'meat' or 'bones'. She asks him if he needs any help but he ignores her. She puts something on his desk. As she walks back to the door he says ""Jean would you like to accompany me to dinner? That is if you're not doing anything."" She says she doesn't have any plans. He sits up and crosses his legs. ""Well! Isn't this a coincidence. Listen where should we go?"" She says she doesn't care where. ""How about anywhere you want?"" he tells her. ""I don't know Patrick I can't make this decision."" ""Come on!"" he says chuckling and pointing his pen at her. ""Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want just say it I can get us in anywhere."" She thinks for a minute. ""How about..."" Patrick flips through his Zagat booklet. ""Dorsia?"" Patrick looks up. ""So. Dorsia is where Jean wants to go."" ""I don't know we'll go wherever you want to go."" ""Dorsia is fine."" He picks up a phone and dials the restaurant. ""Dorsia yes?"" says the man on the other end. Can you take two tonight at oh say nine o'clock?"" ""We're totally booked."" ""Really? That's great."" ""No I said we are totally booked!"" ""Two at nine? Perfect! See you then!"" He hangs up. Jean gives him a quizzical look. ""Yeah?"" he asks taking off his sunglasses. ""You're... dressed okay."" ""You didn't give a name."" ""They know me"" he lies. ""Why don't you meet me at my place at 7:00 for drinks?"" She smiles and starts to leave. ""And Jean? You might want to change before we go out.""Jean looks out the window of Patrick's place. A telescope is pointed out the window. She's dressed in a pretty green strapless dress. ""Patrick it's so elegant. What a wonderful view."" Patrick gets some frozen sorbet out of the fridge. Next to the sorbet is a severed head wrapped in plastic. ""Jean sorbet?"" ""Thanks Patrick. I'd love some."" He gives it to her. ""Do you want a bite?"" ""I'm on a diet but thank you"" he says. ""No need to lose any weight. You're kidding right? You look great"" she tells him. ""Very fit."" ""You can always be thinner... look better."" ""Well maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower."" ""That's alright. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway."" He goes over to a kitchen drawer and starts running his finger over some steak knives. ""So what do you want to do with your life? Just briefly summarize. And don't tell me you enjoy working with children."" She tells him she'd like to travel and maybe go back to school. ""I don't really know. I'm at a point in my life where there seems to be so many possibilities."" Patrick runs his hand across some stainless steel meat cleavers on a triangular base. ""I'm just so unsure."" He asks her if she has a boyfriend. ""No not really."" ""Interesting."" ""Are you seeing anyone? I mean seriously?"" she asks. ""Maybe. I don't know. Not really"" he says with a smile. ""Jean do you feel fulfilled? I mean in your life?"" ""I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work. But now I've really begun to think about changing myself developing and growing."" Patrick reaches into a closet and takes out some silver duct tape. ""Growing. I'm glad you said that. Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog a collie was named Lassie?"" he laughs. ""Who's Ted Bundy?"" ""Forget it."" ""What's that?"" ""Duct tape. I need it for... taping something."" ""Patrick have you ever wanted to make someone happy?"" She starts to put her spoon down on his coffee table. ""No! Put it in the carton!"" ""Sorry."" He takes something else out of the closet and walks behind her. She repeats her question. ""I'm looking for uh..."" He holds up a nail gun and points it at the back of her unsuspecting head. ""I guess you could say I just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special."" His finger moves toward the trigger. The phone rings and the answering machine picks it up. It's Evelyn. ""Patrick... Patrick! I know you're there. Pick up the phone you bad boy. What are you up to tonight?"" He puts the nailgun down behind the couch. ""It's me. Don't try to hide. I hope you're not out there with some number you picked up because you're MY Mr. Bateman. My boy next door."" Jean sips some wine looking at Patrick as she listens. ""Anyway you never called me and you said you would and I'll leave a message for Jean about this tomorrow to remind you but we're having dinner with Melania and Taylor you know Melania she went to Sweetbriar. And we're meeting at the Cornell club. So I'll see you tomorrow morning honey!"" Patrick winces. ""Sorry I know you hate that. Bye Patrick. Bye Mr. Big Time CEO. Bye bye."" She hangs up. Jean says ""Was that Evelyn? Are you still seeing her?"" He doesn't answer. ""I'm sorry. I have no right to ask that. Do you want me to go?"" ""Yeah"" he finally says. ""I don't think I can control myself."" ""I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get involved with unavailable men."" She asks him if he wants her to go. ""I think if you stay something bad will happen. I think I might hurt you. You don't want to get hurt do you?"" ""No I guess not. I don't want to get bruised."" She gets up and starts leaving. On her way out she reminds him that he has a dinner date with Kimball the next day. ""Thanks. It slipped my mind completely.""A crowded restaurant. Bateman and Kimball sit across from each other eating some beef dishes. ""So. The night he disappeared. Any thoughts about what you did?"" asks Kimball. ""I'm not sure. Uh I had a shower and some sorbet?"" ""I think you're getting your dates mixed up."" ""Well where do you place Paul that night?"" He tells Patrick that according to his datebook Paul had dinner with Marcus Halberstram thought Marcus denied it. ""Does Marcus have an alibi?"" ""Yes. I've checked it out it's clean. Now where were you?"" ""Well where was Marcus?"" ""He wasn't with Paul Allen. He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott Fredrick Dibble Harry Newman George Butner and... you."" Patrick looks up. ""Oh right yeah of course."" Kimball makes a 'slipped your mind' gesture. ""We had wanted Paul Allen to come but he had made plans. And I guess I had dinner with Victoria the following night."" Kimball says ""Personally I think the guy just went a little nutso split town for a while maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing drinking whatever. Anyway I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or later. I mean to think that one of his friends killed him for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous. Isn't that right Patrick?"" he says with an eerie smile. Patrick smiles back faintly.Patrick takes a limo to the part of town where he met Christie. She's standing on the same corner. He rolls down the window and calls out to her. ""I'm not so sure about this"" she tells him. ""I had to go to emergency last time."" He promises that this won't be anything like last time. She says no. ""Just come in the limo and talk to me for a minute. The driver is here. You'll be safe."" He holds out some money. Reluctantly she takes it and gets in. He hands her a drink. ""Nothing like last time. I promise"" he repeats. ""Alright."" He tells her she's looking great and asks how she's been. ""I might need a little surgery after last time. My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer."" ""Lawyers are so complicated"" he says writing her a cheque. She takes it and bolts from the car. The car keeps pace with her as she walks. Bateman rolls down the window and whistles at her waving more money. She stops and looks at the wad. She tries to grab it but he pulls his hand back. He opens the car door again moving over to let her get back in. ""Half now half later."" He closes the door. He tells her her name is Christie again and that they are meeting a friend of his named Elizabeth. ""She'll be joining us in my new apartment shortly. You'll like her. She's a very nice girl.""Paul Allen's apartment. Patrick breaks open a capsule of ecstasy onto a spoon and puts it into a bottle of wine. A redhead woman in a white silk shirt and black jacket is sitting on the couch across from Christie. She tells her she looks familiar. ""Did you go to Dalton? I think I met you at a surf bar didn't I. It was spicy. Well maybe not spicy but it was definitely a surf bar."" She talks on and on in a self-important tone neither Patrick or Christie really listening to her. Christie tells Patrick that this place is nicer than his other one. ""It's not that nice"" he says. She asks where he and Elizabeth met. She says it was at the Kentucky Derby in 86. ""You were hanging out with that bimbo Alison Poole. Hot number."" ""What do you mean? She was a hot number."" ""If you had a platinum card she'd give you a blowjob. Listen this girl worked at a tanning salon need I say more?"" She sips her wine. She asks what Christie does. ""She's my... cousin. She's from... France"" says Bateman. Elizabeth asks for the phone to call someone. She asks if Christie summers in Southampton. The person she's calling doesn't answer. ""Elizabeth it's 3 in the morning."" ""He's a god damn drug dealer these are his peak hours."" She says that the wine tastes weird. She leaves the man a message on his answering machine. She looks at Bateman when she can't remember where she is. ""Paul Allen's."" ""I want the number idiot. Anyway I'm at Paul Norman's and I'll try you again later and if I don't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow I'm going to sic my hairdresser on you."" She hangs up. ""Did you know that guy who disappeared didn't he work at Pierce and Pierce? Was he a friend of yours?"" He says no. She asks if he has any coke. He shakes his head. ""Or a Halcyon? I would take a Halcyon."" ""Listen"" he says. ""I would just like to see the two of you *get it on*."" They stare at him. ""What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free."" ""Patrick you're a lunatic."" He asks her if she finds Christie attractive. ""Let's not get lewd. I'm in no mood for lewd conversation."" He says he thinks it would be a turn-on. She asks Christie if he does this all the time. Christie remains silent. He tells her to drink her wine. ""You're telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?"" he asks Elizabeth. ""No. I'm not a lesbian. Why would you think I would be into that?"" ""Well you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing."" ""Those are Sarah Lawrence GUYS Patrick. You're making me feel weird.""Some time later the drugs having kicked in and Elizabeth and Christie are feeling each other up on the couch. Patrick says wistfully ""Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP called simply 'Whitney Houston' had four number-one singles on it? Did you know that Christie?"" Elizabeth starts laughing. ""You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You own a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?"" she laughs falling off the couch. ""It's hard to choose a favorite amongst so many great tracks. But 'The Greatest Love of All' is one of the best most powerful songs ever written about self-preservation dignity its universal message crosses all boundaries and instills one with the hope that it's not too late to better ourselves."" Elizabeth is still laughing. ""Since Elizabeth it's impossible in this world we live in to empathize with others but we can always empathize with ourselves. It's an important message crucial really and it's beautifully stated on the album.""All three have sex Patrick on top of both of them. He moves his face down to Elizabeth's torso and she starts giggling. Christie rolls out from underneath them. She watches them as they fool around under the sheets and she starts gathering her clothes. A stain begins to form on the sheets: Blood. Elizabeth is screaming. Patrick looks up at Christie with blood on his mouth and a crazed look on his face. Christie runs out of the room and Patrick chases her naked. She runs to a door and throws it open to reveal a closet with two dead women in plastic bags hanging on coathangers. The full horror of Patrick's existence finally revealed to her she lets out a bloodcurdling scream. She enters another room and almost vomits. Spraypainted on the wall is the words 'DIE YUPPIE SCUM' and the room is covered with blood and faeces. She backs out and sees Patrick turn the corner naked wielding a chainsaw. She cuts through a maze of doors and finally runs into a bathroom. She falls into a pool of blood next to another dead naked woman. Patrick runs in covered in Elizabeth's blood and starts biting her leg. She kicks him in the face and runs. ""Not the face! Not the fucking face you piece of bitch trash!"" She runs through the living room and out into the hallway pounding and screaming on neighbours' doors but to no avail. Patrick runs after her stark nude and chainsaw in hand. She runs down a circular set of stairs. Patrick reaches the top and holds the chainsaw out over the gap waiting for the right moment. When she nears the bottom he lets go and the chainsaw falls end over end finally hitting its target. He screams in victory. The chainsaw has impaled Christie through the back.Patrick doodles a woman impaled with a chainsaw with a crayon on a paper tablecloth. He hasn't touched his dessert. Evelyn is sitting next to him asking him to commit to their relationship. The restaurant is crowded with middle-class looking people. ""I think Evelyn that uh we've lost touch."" ""Why what's wrong?"" she asks waving to someone. A woman flashes a gold bracelet to her and she mouths ""It's beautiful. I love it."" ""My need to engage in homicidal behaviour on a massive scale cannot be corrected but uh I have no other way to fulfill my needs. We need to talk. It's over it's all over"" he tells her scratching a red X over his drawing. ""Touchy touchy. I'm sorry I brought up the wedding. Let's just avoid the issue alright? Now are we having coffee?"" ""I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over us this is no joke uh I don't think we should see each other any more."" ""But your friends are my friends and my friends are your friends. I really don't think it would work."" She tries to brush some food away from the corner of his mouth but her stops her. ""I know that your friends are my friends and I've thought about that. You can have 'em."" She finally understands. ""You're really serious aren't you? What about the past? Our past?"" ""We never really shared one"" he replies. ""You're inhuman."" ""No. I'm-I'm in touch with humanity."" She starts crying. ""Evelyn I'm sorry I just uh... you're not terribly important to me."" She cries so loudly that the whole restaurant turns to look at her. ""I know my behaviour can be *erratic* sometimes..."" ""What is it that you want?"" she cries. ""If you really want to do something for me then stop making this scene *right now*!"" he snaps. ""Oh God I can't believe this"" she weeps. ""I'm leaving"" he says. ""I've assessed the situation and I'm leaving."" ""But where are you going?"" ""I have to return some videotapes.""Evening. Patrick stops near the lobby of a building to use an ATM. He sticks his card in the machine. Looking down he sees a stray cat. ""Here kitty kitty."" He picks up the cat and starts petting it. A message comes on the screen of the ATM: 'FEED ME A STRAY CAT'. He tries to put the cat in the card slot of the ATM but it pushes itself away. He pulls out a 9mm pistol and points it at the cat's head. A woman in a fur coat sees this. ""Oh my God. What you doing? Stop that!"" He shoots her in the chest and she falls to the ground. He lets the cat go. A siren is heard a block away and a police car pulls up at the other end of the lobby. He takes his card and walks away. He tries to steal a car but every car on the street is locked and he only winds up setting off all their car alarms. He kicks the back of a Porsche and runs. Two police cars cut him off on the next street. They get out guns drawn. ""Drop the weapon! Drop it now! Get on the ground!"" He starts to put his hands up then turns the gun on the officers. They exchange gunfire. He runs behind a parked car for cover firing and hitting one of them. He fires five more shots and both police cars explode in a massive fireball. Stunned by his luck he looks at the gun then at his watch and walks away. He breaks into a run under the support columns of a skyscraper. He walks into the lobby of an apartment. ""Burning the midnight oil Mr. Smith? Don't forget to sign in"" says the man at the desk. He pulls out the gun and shoots him in the head. He runs past the elevators. One of them opens and a janitor gets out. He goes around a revolving door back into the lobby shoots the janitor then out the other side. He runs into another lobby. Out of breath and drenched in sweat he goes up to the desk. Smiling at the doorman he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a pen signs in and goes up in the elevator crying.He reaches his office. He looks out the window then hides from the searchlight of a passing police helicopter. Still crying he makes a phone call. An answering machine picks it up. ""Harold it's Bateman. You're my lawyer so I think you should know I've killed a lot of people. Some girls in the apartment uptown uh some homeless people maybe 5 or 10 um an NYU girl I met in Central Park. I left her in a parking lot behind some donut shop. I killed Bethany my old girlfriend with a nail gun and some man some old faggot with a dog last week. I killed another girl with a chainsaw I had to she almost got away and uh someone else there I can't remember maybe a model but she's dead too. And Paul Allen. I killed Paul Allen with an axe in the face his body is dissolving in a bathtub in Hell's Kitchen. I don't want to leave anything out here. I guess I've killed maybe 20 people maybe 40. I have tapes of a lot of it uh some of the girls have seen the tapes. I even um..."" He almost can't say it. ""I ate some of their brains. I tried to cook a little."" He starts laughing. ""Tonight I uh hahahaha... I just had to kill a LOT of people!"" Crying again. ""And I'm not sure I'm gonna get away with it this time. I guess I'll uh I mean ah I guess I'm a pretty uh I mean I guess I'm a pretty sick guy."" He's smiling. ""So if you get back tomorrow I may show up at Harry's Bar so you know keep your eyes open."" He hangs up and tries to compose himself. The helicopter can still be heard buzzing around but is getting fainter.Morning. He showers and picks a suit from his walk-in closet. He goes to Paul Allen's place putting on a surgical mask because of the smell of the bodies he left there. Opening the door he finds the place empty and repainted white. Three people are talking in one of the rooms and the floor is lined with cloth and there is a ladder and some other redecorating equipment. He heads towards the closet where he left two bodies. It contains only paint cans ladders and buckets. He takes off the mask stunned. ""Are you my 2:00?"" asks a well-dressed 40-something woman behind him. ""No."" ""Can I help you?"" ""I'm looking for Paul Allen's place. Doesn't he live here?"" ""No he doesn't. Did you see the ad in the Times?"" ""No. Yeah. I mean yeah. In the times."" ""There was no ad in the times. I think you should go now."" He asks what happened here. She tells him not to make any trouble and tells him again that he should leave. He starts to leave. ""Don't come back"" she warns. ""I won't. Don't worry."" He closes the door behind him.Outside Bateman calls Jean from a payphone. He downs the rest of a bottle of pills while he waits for her to pick up. She answers. ""Jean... I need help."" He sounds distraught. ""Patrick is that you? Craig McDermott called he wants to meet you Van Paten and Bryce at Harry's Bar for drinks."" ""What did you say you dumb bitch..."" he croaks. ""Patrick I can't hear you."" ""What am I doing?"" he laughs. ""Where are you Patrick? What's wrong?"" He starts crying. ""I don't think I'm going to... make it Jean. To the uh office this afternoon."" ""Why?"" She sounds worried. ""JUST... SAY... NO!"" he screams. ""What is it? Patrick are you alright?"" ""Stop sounding so fucking SAD! JESUS!"" he screams laughing. He hangs up then tries to compose himself.Jean goes to Patrick's desk. She opens a drawer and finds a leather notebook. The first few pages have regular appointments. One page has a drawing of someone getting killed with a shotgun in the mouth.Patrick reaches Harry's Bar. He straightens his dishevelled hair and goes inside. Bryce Van Paten and McDermott are sitting and drinking. McDermott tells him he looks wild-eyed. ""Rough day at the office?"" Bryce is drinking mineral water. ""He's a changed man! But he still can't get a reservation to save his life."" Bateman tells them he isn't going anywhere unless they have a reservation. They discuss various restaurants. Bateman spots his lawyer Harold Carnes across the room and excuses himself. His lawyer is telling someone how the Japanese will own most of the country by the end of the '90s. ""Shut up Carnes they will not. So uh did you get my message?"" ""Jesus yes! That was hilarious! That *was* you wasn't it! Bateman killing Allen and the escort girls. That's fabulous. That's rich."" He asks him what he means. ""The message you left. By the way Davis how's Cynthia? You're still seeing her right?"" ""What do you mean?"" ""Nothing. It's good to see you. Is that Edward Towers?"" He starts to walk away but Bateman stops him. ""Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone. Your joke was amusing. But come on man. You had one fatal flaw. Bateman is such a dork such a boring spineless lightweight. Now if you said Bryce or McDermott otherwise it was amusing. Now if you'll excuse me I really must be going."" For some odd reason Carnes keeps calling Patrick ""Davis"". Patrick angrily stops him again. ""I did it Carnes! I killed him! I'm Patrick Bateman! I chopped Allen's fucking head off"" he whispers with tears in his eyes. ""The whole message I left on your machine was true."" Carnes tries to leave again. ""No! Listen don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis I'm Patrick Bateman!"" He no longer sounds sure who he is. ""We talk on the phone all the time. Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer."" He tells Carnes to listen carefully. ""I killed Paul Allen. And I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer."" Carnes tells him that that isn't possible. ""And I don't find this funny anymore."" ""It never was supposed to be! Why isn't it possible?"" ""It's just not."" ""Why not you stupid bastard?"" says Patrick. ""Because I had dinner with Paul Allen in London twice just ten days ago."" ""No you... didn't."" Patrick is stunned. He begins to doubt whether he actually killed Allen or not or all those other people. Maybe it was all a fantasy. Maybe Patrick Bateman's real name is Davis. Carnes excuses himself again and he lets him go.Jean continues to look with horror through Patrick's notebook. A crude drawing of a woman getting her limbs cut off with a chainsaw. A naked woman nailed to boards. The more pages she turns the worse the images get. Page after page is filled with shocking fantasies of rape murder and mutilation of women.Patrick returns to the table. The guys are watching President Ronald Reagan talking about Iran-Contra on TV. ""How can he lie like that?"" says Bryce. Van Paten continues to ask where they have reservations even though he isn't really hungry. ""How can he be so fucking... I don't know cool about it?"" ""Some guys are just born cool I guess"" says Van Paten. Bateman starts laughing. ""Bateman? What are you so fucking zany about?"" ""Ha ha I'm just a happy camper! Rockin' and a-rollin'!"" Turning back to Reagan on the TV Bryce says ""He presents himself as this harmless old codger but inside... but inside..."" ""But inside doesn't matter""A baffled Bateman narrates: ""Inside yes? Inside? Believe it or not Bryce we're actually listening to you"" says McDermott. Bryce asks Bateman what he thinks. ""Whatever."" Van Paten says he doesn't like dry beers and needs a scotch. Bateman looks over the faces of the people in the room as he narrates. ""There are no more barriers to cross. All I have in common with the uncontrollable and the insane the vicious and the evil all the mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward it I have now surpassed. My pain is constant and sharp and I do not hope for a better world for anyone. In fact I want my pain to be inflicted on others and no one to escape. My punishment continues to elude me. My confession has meant nothing."""

"A nun called sister Marguerite (Elizabeth Arlen) is trying to convince her superiors the Cardinal (Philip Abbott) and the Monsignor (David Gale) that something must be done about a brutal psychopath who is killing people with a satanic ritual. Her superiors don't pay attention to her.A heavily made-up woman phones Russell ""Russ"" Logan (Lou Diamond Phillips) stating that the murderer will commit another crime at a particular place -Sunset Boulevard- at a specific time. The woman makes Logan promise that the murderer won't be killed or given the death sentence.That particular night the third night it's rainy and cold. One police officer pretends to be a bum (Brian Libby) Carmen (Sue Giosa) poses off as a prostitute. Russell and another cop friend Detective Oliver ""Olllie"" Franklin (Mykelti Williamson) of his stay in the car.While Logan's lieutenant tells him off because he's using 12 people for 72 hours and nothing has happened now Carmen has disappeared.The murderer has tied Carmen down. He takes off his mask and saying that she must calm down so that he can help her he puts his mask on her face. He shows a knife to her and is about to cut her bad when Logan appears to save her. The murderer runs away and Logan goes after him. Logan captures him but he gets badly hurt. Patrick Channing (Jeff Kober) the murderer was a kind and meek man who worked for the running water department. Channing is sentenced to death. Channing had threatened Logan outside the court before being eventually sentenced to death. The news breaks it to the first page and there is a party to celebrate it at the police station. Obviously the woman who had tipped Logan is not happy about it. She phones an exultant Logan to tell him that she had advised him not to consider the death penalty and she tells him that he'd better solve the situation. However Logan has not intention to do anything about it. Channing is sent to the gas chamber but when the gas is taken off he can release himself he produces a knife breaks off the mirrored wall and tries to stab Logan who has to shoot him in self-defence.Obviously all this is a nightmare. His cat wakes him up and makes him nervous. Logan picks up his gun and threatens the cat. He wakes up enters a room and sees all the walls stained with blood. When two police officers knock on the door to take him to another crime site he tells them to get inside and take all the fingerprints. When he enters the very same room again there is nothing out of the ordinary. Logan visits a luxury mansion to see to another body. A red-haired woman called Tess Season (Tracy Griffith) has the vision of a pool of blood in the parking lot when she leaves her car. A passerby (David Katims) pushes her to save her from being run over by a car. That passerby had a newspaper on whose first page another murder of a beautiful woman is talked about. It is Carmen the female cop. Seaton thinks that Channing's spirit has been freed and released back into the world although his body had been exterminated. Seaton asks to talk only with Logan and she discovers herself as the woman who had tipped off Logan in the first place. She seems to be a kind of psychic who helped the police to find a child some years before. Seaton A dozed-away drug addict is accused of having killed again. Logan hears the voice of Channing insulting him but the drug addict didn't say anything and nobody else heard anything. Logan and Franklin enter Seaton's mansion house. They listen to her answering machine messages. She had a recorded message from Channing. Logan listens a third message - which has mysteriously disappeared- which sets a date in a particular place the church of Olivera Street. Logan and Franklin take Seaton there by force. She blames Logan because she is now in danger - as both cops are. She stares at Franklin and tells him to be careful because he is in direct danger. There is a fair. There are many people and attractions. A hanson pulled by some horses starts running all over the place. People gets out of the way but Ollie cannot. He is run over. One of the horses gets frantic and hits him with his legs. When Logan and Seaton tend to him Ollie says: ""I've seen him. It is him.""A young man tries to run away. When Logan threatens to shoot that young man on the rooftop of a 10-storey building that young man jumps off. The young man gets to the floor stands up and leaves without being seen by everybody else mocking Logan once again. Nobody believes Logan. Two gang members who were at the site (Charles Raymond & Scott Lawrence) didn't say anything. Commander Perkins (Dennis Lipscomb) tries to reason with Logan but another of his bosses Lieutenant Grimes (Carmen Argenziano) laughs about Logan. Seaton is taken away by her lawyer and she threatens to sue Russ and the police department. When another body of a young male appears crucified Perkins gives to case to Grimes. Logan is afraid that Grimes is not going to do anything about the murder.Logan goes to a church and confesses. He asks an unknown priest (J. Patrick McNamara) to listen to him. Logan says that he lost his faith because his father died and his mother said that it was one of god's kindnesses. He asks the priest whether there may exist cases of possession and a bad spirit entering people in order to make them commit crimes. At that moment the priest becomes Channing again. Logan runs after him. Channing can fly jump as a super-hero. Logan goes after him. Channing appears with a mask and an axe and tries to kill him. ---It was a vision suffered by Seaton. She was at a department store trying to buy a bottle of perfume. With the surprise she breaks the bottle. The shop assistant (Melanie Shatner) tries to convince her of paying the perfume without success as she is already running towards the place in her vision. She goes to the dereclit where he is following Channing to help him. She arrives just in time to shout ""Logan!"" That way Channing misses his shot but the scene is quite similar to Seaton's vision. Tess was able to scare that man away with an iron colgant of the pentacle. Channing takes a ventilator and is about to turn them to pieces with it. Logan and Seaton run away and he confiscates a driver (Robert Colaizzi)'s car using it to run away. Channing jumps on top of the car but they finally succeed. Logan gives his card to the driver and tells him to ask about Grimes who will pay for repairs. They discuss the matter and the hot-dog street vendor (Gokul) overhears their conversation. He says that he's taken her out of hospital and he humorously suggests that he should take her back there fast. Seaton takes Logan to see sister Marguerite. A nun (Lynne Marta) tries to tell them away but they insist. Sister Marguerite finally agrees to see them. She tells them not to mess with the third power and finally rejects to talk to them anymore as the church considers it very dangerous. Logan says during their short conversation that he couldn't care less about the church. Tess tells Logan that he sees Channing because that's the look which the devil wants to to show him.They visit Channing's home. His grandmother (Julianna McCarthy) cautiously opens the door. She lets them in because Logan says that they think that Channing was innocent. She says that Channing's sister Sarah was a very good girl who died young. His father was a good man as was Patrick -- sweet and quiet. Patrick didn't know his own father. Tess Seaton has a vision. Patrick's father had raped his own daughter and had a son from her - Patrick. Tess run away as she was able to feel and repeat Sarah's words. Tess runs to the underground sewers. Another technician (Grand L. Bush) tells them to go away. Some years ago a child was drowned there that's why that particular area is usually closed down. Sister Marguerite wants to leave the convent and tries to steal an image to use it against the devil who is using the third power to possess people. Father Brian (Hansford Rowe) says that he'll pray for her. Marguerite leaves. The police car radio tells to Tess that Logan needs help. She runs after him. He had entered the water system with a shotgun meaning business. Logan pulls her close and tells her to go back outside but she says that he is there. Channing faces Tess Seaton. She shows her the pentacle but it doesn't scare him away: she forces her to show it to herself saying that she was using it the opposite way and that he'll keep on killing as much as he pleases. Logan sees them Channing threatening her with a knife. Tess Season pushes Channing to the floor from an unsafe building structure. When they go to the floor it's drunk Grimes who appears pierced by a piece of tube. Perkins can't believe Logan but he lets him go with a day off. Seaton and Logan go out together. They don't know what to do. On their way to Russ' apartment he gives a coin to a female bum (Nada Despotovich). He produces another gun -an unregistered one- and says that he'll kill everyone who threatens him. Tess tells him that that isn't a plan. They kiss. A noise startles them. They kiss again. This time it's a sonorous thud. He says it's madness and pulls away. The attractive young bag lady appears dancing on the air outside of the room. Tess is startled twice. When she tells Logan he can't see anything until the bag lady appears again breaks through the glass and attacks them. They run away in Logan's car. The bum appears on the back seat of Logan's car. She makes sexual comments and gestures to both of them and she magically sits on his lap. Obviously they end up having a road accident. Their car spirals out of control. Russ gets out on his own feet but Tess has disappeared. Logan visits Marguerite again. She says that future tellers may have the second power but that only god can give somebody the first power. She produces a crucifix with a knife inside. They go to the place where Channing used to make her rituales. Logan kills the bag lady and releases Tess Seaton. Marguerite performs a ritual on the body of the bag lady. She sets the pentacle on fire. Tess and Russ leave through a hole in the wall. Marguerite is slow. He goes to pick her up but she has been possessed. Russ tries to talk to Marguerite saying that she can win over the devil. Possessed Marguerite threatens to shoot him. Russ talks to Patrick on Marguerite's body. He asks him who he killed first - his father? his grandfather? were they the same people? Marguerite tries to stab herself with the crucifix/knife. Suddenly it's Patrick who fights with Logan. Tess opens the doors of the resevoir. Littres and litters of water flood the place. Patrick pulls her to the water when she was about to leave. She cries for help. Logan jumps to the river of water which takes they three through tunnels and tunnels of water. Patrick and Tess are above a pool of acid. They fight. Russ appears to help him and it's Patrick who falls onto the pool of acid. Russ throws a lit lighter onto the pool of acid. Russ and Tess get down the stairs. Patrick attacks him again. The police arrive. Russ is sat on top of Sister Marguerite. The police (Michael Wise) threaten to shoot him. Logan stabs her with the crucifix. Suddenly it's Patrick who was stabbed and died on the floor. A strong light wraps everything and confuses Tess Seaton who can't do anything. The police officers shoot Logan. Patrick is dead.Russ is at hospital. He wakes up and attacks Tess. Tess wakes up -- it was a dream. She stares in horror at Russ - is the devil inside him?Fade to black. Credits roll."

"Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) speaks into a camera recording a description of the crime he has taken part in. He says that he is ""stuck in a tiny cell"" (we see a small portion of this cell and Dalton writing in a journal and doing push-ups) and that he recently executed a bank robbery. He describes the who (himself) the what (the robbery) the where (his current location in 'a tiny cell') the when (recently) and the why (because he can). He says the only question remaining is how the robbery was completed.A man gets into a painter's van parked next to the Coney Island Cyclone. The driver is shown driving through Brooklyn making streetside pickups for a couple of identically dressed painters. The van then enters Manhattan via the Brooklyn Bridge and picks up a final passenger in Chinatown before parking the van outside a branch of the Manhattan Trust Bank at 20 Exchange Place near Broadway and Wall Street.As employees and customers at the bank carry on their business the painters begin to unload what appear to be paint and painting supplies onto hand carts. Dalton who is one of the painters walks into the bank and we recognize him despite the clothes and dark. He places two large high-intensity flashlights on one of the small service tables in the center of the bank's lobby. He turns them on and points them at two of the bank's security cameras blinding them.The other painters follow him into the bank but nobody notices them locking the doors shut. When they raise their masks over their mouths and noses a guard approaches and questions what they are doing. Dalton walks up behind him and puts a gun into his side. The other painters rush in brandishing firearms and dropping smoke bombs and subdue the other customers.A passing NYPD patrol officer Sergeant Collins (Victor Collichio) happens to see smoke coming out from under the bank doors. When he attempts to open the doors he finds they are locked and calls police dispatch. Dalton unlocks a door and points a large .357 Magnum in his face. In a fake European accent he tells Collins he has hostages and threatens to kill them if the cops come too close. He then retreats inside the bank and re-locks the doors. Removing his pistol from his holster Collins begins clearing the street of pedestrians as he radios for help.At the 11th Precinct Detective Second Grade Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) is on the phone with his girlfriend Sylvia (Cassandra Freeman) who works as a desk officer at another precinct. They are discussing a corruption investigation involving Frazier that involves a crooked drug-dealer who set Frazier up to appear as if he embezzled a large sum of drug-deal money. The charge is holding up his being considered for promotion to Detective First Grade which would give him the money to buy a house and marry Sylvia. He's mildly disconcerted that Sylvia's brother is a petty bumbling crook who has spent time in lockup for trying to rip off a car. Sylvia insists that he's the only family she's got. Frazier and Sylvia finish the conversation with ""sweet nothings"" and looking forward to a romantic tryst at home that night.Frazier's partner Bill Mitchell (Chiwetel Ejiofor) briefly discuss how Sylvia's brother is a thorn in Frazier's side though Frazier acknowledges that Sylvia still loves him despite his bumbling attempts at petty heists and he can't put the young man out of their house.Their conversation is interrupted by their commanding officer Captain Mattias Coughlin (Peter Gerety) who informs them that he's assigning them to work the hostage situation happening at the Manhattan Trust Bank. Jumping at the offer they hurry to get to the bank.While this is happening the police arrive in full force at the Manhattan Trust including patrol officers a mobile command center and the Emergency Services Unit. Barricades are set up to cordon off the block with quick efficiency. ESU Sergeant Hernandez (Jason Manuel Olazabal) leader of the ESU unit meets with Collins to get a preliminary report.Word of the bank robbery also is sent to the bank's founder and chairman Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer). When told by his secretary his concern at the hostage situation is clear but his face falls further when his secretary tells him the robbery is taking place at the branch at 20 Exchange Place.Frazier arrives and makes contact with Sergeant Collins who briefs him on what little he's seen of the situation and they prepare to get to work.In the bank the robbers are also conducting their own operation with cool efficiency. They herd all the hostages downstairs to where the vault is. One of the robbers clearly a woman separates the bank employees from the customers. Dalton announces that his cohorts are going to be collecting everyone's cell phones and keys. They find one bank employee with no cell phone. Dalton confronts the employee Peter Hammond (Peter Frechette) and warns him not to try and play hero by hiding his phone. Hammond insists he left his phone at home. Dalton grabs the bags containing all the collected cell phones and begins looking through their speed-dial memories. After tossing a number of phones aside he finds one that has Hammond's cell phone number on it. He calls the phone and immediately a distinctive ring tone is audible from Hammond's office. Dalton retrieves it and holds it up before Hammond. Busted and now terrified Hammond begs for his life. Dalton doesn't shoot him but does drag Hammond into hiss office and proceeds to use his fists and feet to viciously beat Hammond senseless.Dalton then separates the men and women hostages and orders them to undress. A few have to be 'encouraged' with a gun held up close to their faces but finally they all strip to their underwear. One woman in late middle age still refuses even when threatened directly even telling Dalton to go ahead and kill her. Dalton has the woman bank robber who he calls Stevie (Kim Director) lead the woman away to be 'dealt with in private.' Dalton then distributes painter's suits with fumes masks and dark shades ordering everyone to put them on. Now the hostages and robbers are all indistinguishable from one another.Frazier and Mitchell meet the ESU Captain John Darius (Willem Dafoe). None of the police yet know how many perps are inside nor how many hostages. Frazier announces he and Mitchell will wait for a call from Darius at the nearest diner once a briefing is ready.Inside the bank one of the hostages is coughing and wheezing uncontrollably. Grabbing him Dalton ushers him to the door and pushes him outside into the waiting arms of the police. Unable to immediately determine if he is a perp or hostage the police handcuff him and lead him away.At this point the movie begins to periodically shift between the main storyline and Frazier and Mitchell interviewing hostages at the precinct after the robbery has ended. They are trying to pick out the perpetrators from the rest of the hostages.One of the hostages (Rodney 'Bear' Jackson) who works as a bank security guard is being interviewed and he tells Frazier and Mitchell that he was afraid he'd never see his family again. He speaks about his wife and children and wondering if he'd get to hold them again.Dalton and his accomplices are seen inspecting the layout of the bank. They walk past the vault the safe deposit boxes and into a store room where various stationery and other office equipment is. Dalton looks at the store room and says 'Beautiful.'At a high-rise office elsewhere in Manhattan a high power ""fixer"" Madeline White (Jodie Foster) is interviewing a nephew of Osama bin Laden's who is purchasing property in the city. She makes note that the nephew is doing no business with his uncle and hasn't seen him in nine years (around the time of bin Laden's bombing of the US embassies). The interview is interrupted by White's assistant who tells her that Arthur Case is on the phone.White takes the call specifically asking her assistant if Case made the call personally or whether a secretary announced that she was placing the call for him. Assured that Case is on the line himself White has the call patched through. Case knowing White's profession explains that he has a small problem requiring a person with 'special skills and complete discretion.' She assures him she is more than capable of doing such a job.Frazier and Mitchell are interviewing a number of hostages about the robbery. Peter Hammond (his face visibly bruised) speaks about how the robbers were 'insistent and yet detached.' A young man whose face was not seen before tells the detectives that the perps called each other a variation of 'Steven--' Steve Steve-O and Stevie (the woman perp). The employee with the heart condition (Gerry Vichi) is saying the only thing he ever stole was a nickel from his grandmother when he was a boy.Captain Darius summons Frazier and Mitchell and briefs them on what he's learned from the released hostage Herman Gluck who is 73 and who was released after complaining of chest pains. He is currently being treated by paramedics. From Gluck Darius says the perps told him to say to the police that if any officers approached the door two dead bodies would be thrown out. Gluck said he believes there are four individuals in total conducting the robbery. The police arrange to download the video feed from the bank's security system from its main office. The block is secured with snipers in key locations and they're checking with the DEP about sewer grates. Frazier announces he's going to wait for the suspects to make the first move wait and see what they do.White and Case are walking along the riverfront discussing what Case needs. He has precious family heirlooms inside his safety deposit box at the branch that is being held up. White is intrigued that Case personally called her instead of acting through his people saying it means that the safety box contains something that Case doesn't want to even hint at even to his closest and most trusted aides. She tells him coolly but curtly that she doesn't need to be told what the box contains but if she discovers it's something much more serious than anything Case might hint at their agreement is over. Case also speaking curtly tells her that the box contains items that he's had since before White was born and pose no danger to anyone--although White notes 'except to you.' Case and White both clearly distrust each other are suspicious of one another's honesty and don't particularly like each other... but she assures him she can ensure that nobody discovers the contents or even the existence of his safe deposit box. Case has no reason to believe the robbers are targetting the box or are even aware of it but he is taking extremely great pains to avoid taking any chances.In the bank's storeroom Steve (Carlos Andrés Gómez) is telling Dalton that it's time for Steve-O (James Ransone) who begins using a pickaxe to dig under the floor of the storeroom.Outside using a tip from the released hostages that the robbers are dressed as painters Mitchell and Fraizer search vehicles parked nearby and discover a Chevrolet Express van with decals on the side reading ""Perfectly Planned Painting... We NEVER Leave Until the Job is _Done._"" Frazier quickly determines that the logos are just a peel-away decal covering the white stencilling marking the van as belonging to an electric company... meaning it's stolen.Inside the mobile command center Frazier calls the bank to establish contact. Dalton is shown sitting at the desk watching the phone ring but chooses not to answer. An officer inside the center named Rourke (Daryl Mitchell) brings up the video feed from the camera's security system. They see each camera go out and lose transmission one by one and pick out Dalton shining what appear to be flashlights at them. He deduces the flashlights emitted infrared light pulses which is invisible to humans but is picked up by the cameras. It allowed Dalton to knock out the cameras very discretely without anyone noticing what he was doing. He did this at about 10 am and for two minutes there is no video footage of anyone entering or leaving the bank.Frazier and Mitchell are seen questioning Miriam (Marcia Jean Kurtz) the hostage who refused to undress. She is still frightened and in tears even after the ordeal was finished.The perps release another hostage from the bank his hands behind him and something placed around his chest. When he doesn't respond to police orders they note his hands are tied and pat him down thoroughly. Pulling off the mask and shades they find a blindfold and gag underneath them. Once released the hostage says he is Vikram Walla (Waris Ahluwalia) and he is a bank employee. He is Sikh and the officers mistake him for Arab causing them to jump and they think he has a bomb hanging from his neck. When the device is taken he is roughly seized and hauled away the officers pulling his turban away much to his outrage. Frazier and Mitchell look closely at the device taken from him but don't touch it.White pays a visit to the mayor (Peter Kybart) who greets her very cordially and pleasantly and they begin to speak in a very friendly manner about assorted business while walking out of the mayor's press room. No sooner are they behind closed doors when their respective demeanors change in an instant--the mayor outright despises White and is extremely happy to hear that the favor she is here for is the last she intends to ask him. White tells the mayor she's going down to the hostage situation and she needs the mayor to make sure that she is afforded ""every courtesy"" by the ""people in charge."" The mayor is outraged noting that he'll have to do more than call in favors--he'd end up owing quite a few much to his displeasure. White clearly has enough influence to get the mayor to do what she asks though it's not revealed what sort.Frazier Mitchell and Darius are questioning a very hostile and angry Vikram (though this is while the robbery is still going on). Vikram is extremely upset about the seizing of his turban which is paramount to his Sikh religion. Frazier does everything possible to soothe his ruffled feathers and asks Vikram to concentrate on the safety of his co-workers. Vikram reveals he believes there to be four robbers and somewhere between twenty and forty hostages. The perps are all armed and making no mistakes.Frazier opens the case that was hung around Vikram's neck. It is empty though there is writing on the inside of it--demands from the robbers. They want two buses with a full gas tank a fully fueled and manned jumbo jet waiting for them at John F. Kennedy International Airport all by 9 pm. After that a hostage will be executed in front of TV cameras every hour. The bank is secured with Semtex (a plastic explosive with military uses) and the robbers will demonstrate if necessary. Frazier says the perps won't even get a cup of coffee until he talks to them. He's going to give them time to wonder what the police are up to.Collins shows Case into the command center and introduces him to Frazier Mitchell and Darius. He seems curiously relieved when he is told the robbers are asking for a jet and even offers to arrange one for them. Sounding tired and out of breath he asks to remain with them but of course as a civilian he cannot be afforded this and they promise to keep him updated but have him sent on his way to await news.Dalton steps outside of the bank and hands one of the officers a piece of paper which instructs the cops to deliver enough food to feed all the hostages. In the command center Officer Berk (Ashlie Atkinson) suggests they send in pizzas as the pizza boxes can conceal hidden transmitters and lots of the people will group around the boxes allowing for them to pick up more conversations. Frazier notes that he is not going ask anything from the robbers in return for the pizza as they have already released two hostages. He knows that the robbers have everything well-planned and he is not willing to risk getting caught bluffing them.Inside the bank one of the hostages finally gets frustrated and pulls off his mask arguing with his fellow hostages over his losing control. Finally Dalton storms in grabs him by his ankle drags him into the storeroom and punches him out.Another 'after the robbery questioning' is shown Frazier and Mitchell tricking a man into removing his hearing aids and demonstrating he is able to hear their questions without them.The pizzas and bottled water are delivered. Frazier introduces himself to Dalton while the three Stevens quickly shuttle the food inside the bank. He tells Dalton to pick up the phone at any time. Dalton simply stares at Frazier saying nothing and then locks the doors again.Through the hidden transmitters the command center personnel hear a foreign language spoken. Believing it to be Russian Frazier has Mitchell check with Gluck and Vikram to see if they remember hearing any of the robbers speaking Russian.Steve and Stevie are shown herding hostages around from room to room to keep them disoriented. During the procedure unseen by any of the hostages Stevie hands Steve her gun doffs her gloves and shades and puts on an eye mask like those the hostages are being made to wear and begins acting as though she is crying hysterically in a loud voice for the hostages to hear so that it appears that Stevie is in fact one of the hostages. Steve roughly ushers her into a room and makes her sit down. He then grabs another female hostage about the same height as Stevie who he treats rudely calling her 'boobs' because of her large bust. He ushers her into another room while making sure all the hostages have their masks on and are keeping their hands on the ground.More 'after-the-robbery questioning' scenes are shown. Nancy Mann (Samantha Ivers) a woman who was talking loudly on her cell phone just before the robbers struck angrily rails about the hostage who took off his mask and started acting up until punched out by Dalton (the name Darius Peltz is written on the photograph).Stevie is seen working in the storeroom cleaning up after a hole has been dug in the floor. Her cleavage spills out of her tank-top t-shirt much like the female hostage Steve rudely called 'boobs' while ushering her from one room to another.In the mobile command center the officers are going over the recording made through the bugged pizza boxes. Another officer skilled in linguistics is unable to correctly identify the language although he believes it is Central European. Frazier comes up with an idea: one of the bystanders standing behind the barricades on the street probably will recognize the language. He has Berk broadcast the recording through the MCC's speakers and goes out to the barricades asking pedestrians if anyone understands the language.A sanitation worker named Kevin (Al Palagonia) comes forward saying that the language is Albanian. Unfortunately he himself cannot translate it for the officers: he only recognizes the language because his ex-wife and her parents are Albanian natives and he recognizes the language from listening to her speak with her parents who knew no English at all.A check on the van meanwhile reveals that it was stolen two days earlier but has also been wiped clean of fingerprints.In the bank Dalton is bringing pizza and a water bottle to Brian Robinson (Amir Ali Said) the eight-year-old son of one of the hostages who is sitting in the bank's vault playing a hand-held video game which has kept him occupied throughout the whole ordeal. Dalton sits beside him and watches him eat. Dalton is far more civil respectful even humble with Brian than he'd been shown as conducting himself at any time prior to this moment. He picks up Brian's video game and asks him how it works seeming appalled at how brutally violent it is reveling in the most cutthroat 'gangzta' violence.The police run into trouble trying to get an interpreter to translate the Albanian dialogue as the Albanian Consulate and the State Department outside the city jurisdiction are refusing to send someone to help. With no other options Frazier tells Kevin insistently to call his ex-wife and ask her to come to the site so she can translate.A brief scene is shown where Dalton stands in the vault removing his mask and shades as he stares at the cash on the vault's shelves.Back in the MCC Kevin's Albanian ex-wife Ilina (Florina Petcu) is escorted into the MCC. Ilina is a sultry vain self-centered woman who seems to understand how badly the Mobile Command Center officers need her help and takes the time to enjoy lording over them brazenly lighting up a cigarette over Mitchell's admonishments not to smoke inside the MCC and handing Frazier a bag full of unpaid parking tickets which she expects him to 'fix' in return for her services. Ilina listens to the recording and breaks into a light completely amused laugh: not only does she know what is being said but the voice that they're hearing is that of Enver Hoxha... the former President of Albania who has been deceased for 20 years. They are listening to a tape recording of a speech Hoxha made during his presidency about the greatness of Albanian people--a Marxist-Leninist propaganda speech. Frazier and Mitchell are left back at square one steaming over how they'd been outplayed. Dalton and crew not only knew that the pizza boxes were bugged they were counting on it--to send the hapless detectives on a wild goose chase.Back in the bank Steve chows down on pizza as the transmission device easily located by him and his colleagues is carefully placed near an iPod that is still transmitting the recording of the Hoxha propaganda speech.Stevie and Dalton go into the bank's safety deposit box room. Stevie places a key into safety deposit box 392 and carefully picks the second lock. She opens the hatch and pulls out the deposit box where Dalton carefully undoes a large twine-and-button closure on a suede envelope holder resting on top of the box's contents. He pulls out a manila envelope that has Arthur Case's name on it and contains a number of legal documents. Dalton glances at Stevie who smiles complacently she looks back at Dalton. Underneath the envelope still in the safety deposit box rest a large number of black velvet pouches tied with drawstrings... and a red jewelry box suitable for holding a ring. Dalton takes the documents to the desk just outside the safety deposit vault as Stevie closes the deposit box back up.White arrives with the mayor in a sleek black GMC SUV is allowed through the barricade and summon Fraizer for a meeting. The three begin a careful parley about White having influence that may be of use to Frazier for reasons above Fraizer's 'pay grade' and that in turn leads to a careful parley about his promotion possibly being pushed through the red tape holding it up.Collins and Hernandez are making more preparations for a potential storming of the bank while inside the command center Frazier finally makes contact with Dalton over the phone. After the ice is broken over calling out Dalton over the Hoxha tape the negotiations get down to the nitty-gritty. Dalton takes command warning Frazier that the many innocent lives at stake rob him of any power to call any shots in the negotiations. Dalton talks Frazier listens and complies promptly with all demands or people stop breathing--permanently. Once the conversation is ended Frazier is troubled at how completely calm Dalton sounded. Someone who was completely sure of himself and in control of his surroundings.Meanwhile White sits in the diner used as the waiting point watching everything she can see from her vantage point.In another 'after-the-robbery' scene Frazier and Mitchell are interviewing another hostage--or not; the 'hostage' is clearly Steve although Frazier and Mitchell don't know that. Steve has given his name as Kenneth Damerjian. The interrogation reveals a key point in Dalton's making all the hostages dress up in the painter outfits with masks and shades just like he and his fellow robbers along with the hostages being constantly moved from room to room as well as each of the 'Stevens' taking turns pretending to be hostages... it allowed them to mingle with the true hostages and during key points they all unmasked so the hostages saw their faces and could point them out from the array of photographs as being fellow hostages. Steve's dialogue shows that he deliberately misbehaved during his time impersonating a hostage so others would see him being treated as one--at one point his colleagues even bound and gagged him as ""punishment"" and Frazier saw him that way.Frazier is negotiating again with Dalton on the phone making little headway against Dalton's continuous warnings that Frazier is in no position to do anything other than exactly what Dalton already told him to do because so many lives depend on it. Frazier desperately tries to bargain for extra time offering to bring more food for the robbers and hostages.Dalton finally offers Frazier a bone. He asks Frazier a riddle; which weighs more all the trees cut down to print all US currency presently in circulation or all the trains passing through Grand Central Station in a year? If Frazier answers correctly he gets more time. If not someone could be dying very soon. Dalton offers one hint: it's a trick question.The Command Center team furiously ponders the riddle until Darius and Mitchell point out that it's a trick because the answer is 'the same': US money is not printed on paper at all but cotton fibers meaning no trees were cut down; while Grand Central STATION is the proper term for the post office in that area while the hub of train platforms is properly called Grand Central TERMINAL or just Grand Central.Frazier calls Dalton and is just about to answer that the trains weigh more when Mitchell stops him makes him hang up and says it's a trap: Frazier must tell Dalton that both weigh the same. Frazier does so and Dalton tells him to send sandwiches this time (which will allow the hostages to spread out while they eat so no hidden bugs can be planted).Inside one of the rooms in the bank a number of hostages are passing time in conversation. One of them a Hasidic man named Chaim (Bernard Rachelle) mentions he is a professor of criminal law at Columbia teaching courses on genocide slave labor and war reparation. He is also a former attorney.Dalton Stevie and Steve-O are examining the finished hole dug in the storeroom floor and Steve-O dryly remarks 'Now that's a good-looking shithole.'Frazier calls Sylvia who is relaxing at home although she is very anxious about Frazier's well-being. They talk a little about the ongoing situation and Frazier hopes to finish it up very soon. As he finishes the conversation he lightly raps on the diner window signaling White to come outside. After making her promise that she understands the 'ground rules' they talked about earlier Frazier uses his cell phone to contact Dalton inside the bank so that White can talk to him directly. Madeline tells Dalton that if she is allowed to make sure that 'certain interests are protected' she can help him get what he came for. The conversation between Dalton and White is another carefully worded cat-and-mouse game where it is very unclear who is the cat. But White succeeds in getting something: after she assures Dalton that she is neither a bank employee nor a police officer he tells her that she can come into the bank and talk to him face to face.Frazier and two officers escort White to the bank doors and Frazier warns her that after ten minutes as far as he is concerned White can count herself as another hostage. Once inside the bank White is made to lie on the floor while Stevie pats her down to ensure she is unarmed. Dalton waits behind the teller counters. As White approaches Dalton asks why she thinks he needs her help shrugging off her reply about the vertiable army of police outside. White presents her offer: If Dalton gives up now she can make sure he'll get no more than the minimum prison sentence and when it's completed he'll have two million dollars waiting for him to pick up from a safe place. Dalton takes the terms with an air of what is plainly mock surprise and then turns it down. He then asks White again to tell him about the 'interests' she's trying to protect.When White says she can't talk about them Dalton stuns her by saying that he can--he already knows why White is here--he even knows something she doesn't. He tells her a story about an American man who worked as a clerk for a Swiss bank during World War II. He used his position with the Nazis to enrich himself while people all around him were being stripped at gunpoint of everything they owned and then used his blood money to open a bank in New York. In fact the man Dalton is describing is Case who at this same time is in his office looking wistfully at a large number of awards given him by Jewish interest groups and charity organizations for his long years of service to their causes.Dalton finishes up by asking White if this man he is telling her about sounds like the man she might be working for. Defeated but trying to act like she hasn't been White says she and Dalton understand each other. When Dalton repeats his question as to what help White can offer him since he's shown he knows a lot more than her about what's going on and has planned everything so completely White sharply rebuffs that she still has enough power in the games being played to throw a serious monkey wrench into Dalton's plans. She wants two minutes to go into one safety deposit box and retrieve something from there. But again Dalton shows he's one step ahead of everyone--including White herself. He shows her the legal documentation (a Nazi swastika can be plainly seen on one of the pages) he's taken from the box saying that it now belongs to him as its previous owner was too careless to destroy them when he had the chance. Dalton is keeping them as leverage--if he is ever captured and put on trial for the robbery White and her employer will have to use all their resources to get him off the hook. When White asks how Dalton plans to get out of the bank he casually says he will walk right out the front door.Back outside the bank Frazier debriefs White on the conversation with Dalton. He's far too smart to fall for her carefully worded answers but has little in the way of pressuring her into telling everything he wants. White believes Dalton will not kill anyone but Frazier is unconvinced. Dalton doesn't appear to have been pushed into a corner; he seems to have chosen to go there. White has done all she can in the situation and Frazier dismisses her after a brief exchange of words culminating in a subtle warning from White that she is still a major figure on the chess board.More post-robbery interrogations follow:Brian and his father Ray (Ed Onipede Blunt) are being interviewed. Brian is able to tell them a little about Dalton although not enough for them to have a lead. Everyone all looked the same especially to Brian given the hostages were dressed to look just like the robbers including hoods and masks. Another former hostage Paul Gutierrez (Lemon Andersen) is shown to have a rap sheet leading Frazier and Mitchell to press him hard in an attempt to trick him into revealing something that only one of the robbers would know but to no avail. They are speaking the hard-of-hearing Jewish man again showing photos of Darius Peltz and Kenneth Damerjian. It is revealed that Peltz (the hostage who pulled off his mask and was punched out by Dalton) is Steve-O showing that all three 'Stevens' all acted up at some point while posing as hostages until Dalton came in to 'discipline' them; all part of the act so all three 'Stevens' would appear as fellow hostages. The Jewish man looks at the photos but cannot determine anything suspicious about them. Finally Frazier and Mitchell are seen interviewing Stevie. Noting her large bust they say there's only one other woman among the hostages besides her who fit the physical description of the female suspect--moderately tall young and large-busted. But Stevie does not break or back down; her answers are cool and sardonic and the detectives cannot pick out anything that separates her from the other hostages.Frazier Mitchell and Darius are in the Command Center discussing hostage-takers all wanting planes and never getting them yet they keep demanding one whenever another hostage situation arises. Frazier is thoughtful for a moment and then picks up the phone to call Dalton. He explains to Mitchell that he doesn't buy Dalton's insistence that Frazier be quick about the plane--he believes that Dalton knows hostage-negotiating procedures and is using the 'tricks of the trade' against them. As negotiatiors Frazier and Mitchell need to do whatever they can to stall for time but Frazier believes that Dalton is actually the one stalling--the Enver Hoxha tape the trick-question riddle; Dalton keeps providing subtle loopholes allowing him to give Frazier more time. Dalton is not in a hurry to go anywhere.Frazier calls Dalton and bluffs him saying the plane is ready but he needs to come into the bank and make sure the hostages are okay and none of them have been killed. Dalton agrees.Frazier is let into the bank and frisked by Steve-O before being led up the stairs inside. Dalton leads Frazier through a series of connecting offices where the hostages sit masked and clothed the same as Dalton and the other robbers. Brian alone is in his regular street clothes as he is too small to fit into the appropriate 'disguise.' Frazier asks for Brian to be released but Dalton demurs.Frazier asks if there are any other hostages. Dalton says that some had misbehaved and they are in the next room. He opens the door where Frazier sees a number of hostages who are bound and gagged--among them Stevie crying as she tries to dislodge her gag and Steve. All part of the plan so the two of them and Steve-O could not be picked out from the other hostages.Dalton says the tour is over and he and Steve-O begin leading Frazier back out. Frazier finally confronts Dalton admitting no plane is ready and that Dalton probably doesn't even want one because he's been stalling for time and Frazier wants to know why. Dalton coolly answers that he knows Frazier's commanding officer will not order a siege when no hostages have been killed and there's no threat and even if it happened Frazier would not be the hero.Near the door Frazier asks if Dalton wouldn't just walk out the front door and Dalton says he will do so when he's ready. After a bit of small talk Frazier offers Dalton a handshake which turns out to be a ploy to get Dalton to drop his guard just long enough for Frazier to grab him and wrestle him to the ground. Unfortunately Steve-O is there with his rifle jammed into Frazier's back before Frazier can effect a capture. Frazier is forced to bank off hands up as he nervously looks at Steve-O and Dalton's readied weapons. They push him out of the bank where he is met by Mitchell.Steve-O and Dalton go to the supply room where Steve is working. Steve-O confronts Dalton on Frazier almost capturing him. Dalton impatiently asks Steve 'how long?' and Steve says that it will be two hours; maybe three.Frazier enters the MCC and briefs Darius. He gave Dalton every reason to kill him but Dalton didn't bite--he now believes White's claim that Dalton isn't the type to murder. The whole robbery has been planned with utmost care--the Hoxha speech tape the disguises the demand for a plane even though he didn't really expect one; Frazier knows Dalton is up to something specific but it's not violence.But at that moment the phone rings; Dalton is making contact. He tells Frazier to have the MCC's camera zoom in on a second-floor window. Officer Rourke zooms in and the camera reveals Dalton and five others in a semi-circle around a seventh person whose head is covered in a white sack. Dalton holds up a hand then levels a pistol at the seventh person and fires his gun point-blank. A spray of blood comes through the sack as the executed hostage slowly crumples to the ground; the other five people cringing and crying out in horror and fear. Frazier looks on shaken to the core before hurrying to the bank's front door and pounding on it.Dalton is there on the opposite side of the door. He and Frazier have it out in a verbal argument. Frazier insists that the police command all know that the whole 'bank robbery' is a sham but Dalton is unruffled saying he told Frazier to get the buses. Frazier tries to press for what Dalton really wants so he can get it for him but Dalton sticks to the 'buses and a plane' demand. Frazier calls him out telling Dalton he's not buying the routine anymore. Dalton opens the door and points his gun at Frazier demanding he leave. But Frazier stands his ground challenging Dalton to kill him. Dalton curses Frazier out and tells him to have the command center send someone sane the next time they want to talk to him.Captain Darius calls his superiors to report the shooting. As Frazier is returning to the MCC he finds Captain Coughlin waiting for him. Coughlin allows Frazier to say very little. He had gone to bed and the hostage situation was proceeding smoothly then was called at 3:15 am and told of a murdered hostage. Coughlin tells Frazier that Captain Darius is now in charge and Frazier does nothing without Darius' approval. Mitchell is exasperated to hear that he and Frazier are no longer in control.Coughlin and Darius study blueprints of the bank with a number of police ESU leaders preparing to storm the bank and end the situation. We see scenes of an imagined siege scenario as the officers discuss and plan. The biggest problem is that they cannot tell who will be a hostage and who will be a perp until the perps start shooting. They decide to use rubber bullets to avoid hostage casualties.It is morning again and Mitchell and Frazier are talking. Mitchell knows that if the siege goes down wrong the mess will be dumped into Frazier's lap and he will be the scapegoat. But Frazier reveals the 'deal' that White and the Mayor made with him to push his promotion to First Grade through channels. Mitchell is shocked and stares gravely as Frazier heads outside for some air.Frazier makes small talk with Sergeant Collins who sympathizes with Frazier being cheated at being excluded from the storming of the bank. Frazier conversationally asks Collins about the last time he had a gun pointed at him. Collins carelessly drops a racial slur but apologizes when Frazier calls him out on it. After Collins tells his story he promises to speak more carefully in the future because 'you never know who's listening in.'Frazier's face changes quickly. He rushes back into the MCC and grabs the metal case sent out with Vikram Walia which contained the original demands. He wrenches at the case and pulls off a panel to find a transmission device. Dalton not only knew about the police bugging the bank with the pizza boxes--he had bugged THEM first. He knows about the planned storming of the bank which has been in planning for many hours and has had all that time to make preparations.Grabbing a microphone he frantically warns Darius insisting he and the ESU officers stand down telling them about the transmitter and that Dalton heard everything that had been said in the MCC since the metal case was brought inside. But Darius refuses to stand down; he says he's going in--now.Inside the bank Dalton pulls a small earpiece out of his ear and curses.Dalton alerts the three 'Stevens' who spring into action. Dalton starts laying smoke grenades as his colleagues gather all the hostages together out of the offices into the hallway making sure they all have their hoods and masks on. Dalton shouts and waves his gun to herd the hostages upstairs while Stevie and Steve-O are seen leaving their rifles in the offices doffing their sunglasses for the hostage eye masks.The police are about to begin their siege on the bank when suddenly the door is blown open with a small explosive. A few at a time people in painter outfits dark shades and masks begin running out hands raised to shoulder level pleading for the police not to shoot. Despite this some officers open fire using the rubber bullets until Captain Darius orders them to hold. All of the people are herded together and made to lie down on the ground. They are put in plasticuffs and masks are removed... we see Stevie glancing around as she is cuffed looking fearful; Steve lies with his face against the pavement beside Paul Gutierrez while Steve-O lies on his back hands raised level with his head as he trembles anxiously.The ESU officers lead the way into the bank sweeping the place room by room. Darius Frazier and Mitchell enter and begin the investigation. Immediately they begin finding evidence that just as Frazier had deduced this was no ordinary robbery. First they find all of the bank's money still in the vault. It appears untouched by the robbery crew. On a shelf in the cash vault is a bag with all the cell phones confiscated from the hostages. There are no booby traps or escape tunnels anywhere. Second they find the rifles left behind by the three 'Stevens' (so they could run out with the hostages and be indistinguishable from them) and realize that the firearms are not real--they are toys carefully painted to look real but cannot fire any actual ammunition. In the women's bathroom they find the white sack used to cover the head of the slain hostage--with a hidden injector tube of red dye; proof that the execution was staged and nobody was actually harmed. In the supply room are plastic trash bags containing all the street clothes from the hostages.Outside two police buses pull up and the officers there begin hustling all the hostages to their feet putting them on a bus to be taken to the station for questioning. The bank guard is hostile and argumentative and some other hostages try to cry in vain that they are not part of the robbery crew. Officers take each hostage's name and photograph them before putting them on the buses. Stevie gives her real name as Valerie Keepsake and the Hasidic attorney/professor hostage gives his name as Chaim.Frazier and Coughlin meet in a conference room at their precinct HQ. Frazier gives the grim details at how thoroughly and flawlessly planned the whole affair was. Each hostage was shown photographs and questioned about anyone who stood out in any way. But every single hostage has at least a few people who would rule them out as suspicious. Even Stevie/Valerie Steve/Kenneth and Steve-O/Darius are vouched for by others thanks to the time they spent posing as hostages even causing a ruckus that required Dalton to come in and put them back in line. With no money missing from the bank--it has been re-counted several times and every last dollar is accounted for--it's like the whole thing never happened. They can't even find Dalton's .357 magnum (he was the only one of the robbery crew armed with a handgun) to see if it was real or fake like the rifles left behind.Coughlin tells Frazier to bury the case. Even though Frazier knows that somebody did SOMETHING throughout the whole situation nobody's breathing down Coughlin's neck to give answers so he won't breathe down Frazier's. He restates his orders: bury the case.As Frazier gets up to leave Coughlin gives him an afterthought: the missing money Frazier was accused of embezzling has been found. He's off the hook. Frazier is pretty surprised and not entirely in a pleasant manner. He asks Coughlin not to tell him where the money was found--he doesn't want to know.A safety deposit box number 392 is briefly shown.Mitchell is rambling on about the people who had accused Frazier of wrongdoing or impropriety and how they are the only ones still trying to find out anything about the robbery. Frazier is looking over a series of bank files when suddenly he pauses. He's looking over a list of safety deposit boxes for the bank where the ordeal took place. The list skips from box 391 straight to box 393--box number 392 is not listed in the records. Grabbing his jacket he tells Mitchell to come with him.Frazier goes to the courthouse where he's seen shaking a judge's hand and saying he'll be by tomorrow to pick up something that the judge will be providing him. As Frazier re-enters the atrium he finds Madeline White waiting for him. She confronts him on his visiting a city judge and being told to bury the case reminding him of their 'arrangement.' But Frazier shows his trump card--a simple writing pen that Officer Berk showed him contained a hidden recording device. Frazier replays a recording when he was in the SUV with White and the mayor--he'd had the pen in his suitcoat pocket. The recording has captured the Mayor ordering Frazier to give White everything she needed in the robbery or his career was finished; whether he was guilty of the drug money embezzlement or not.Frazier tries to press White about Arthur Case. He knows that Case is hiding something. White asks again for Frazier to leave everything be but he leaves without answering her.White brazenly marches into an exclusive men's club to confront Case. She is addressing him by his first name now. She says that Frazier is 'under control' and that Dalton is holding onto the envelope Case was concerned about. White then informs Case on what she's learned from the robbers: Case built his fortune doing business with the Nazis during World War II. Case doesn't deny the truth of it saying he sold his soul and has spent his entire life trying to buy it back. White says that there appears to be no danger of Dalton using the envelope against Case immediately--he's hanging on to it as insurance in case he is ever caught and charged and he might one day offer to sell it back to Case. But White knows that Dalton was not stopping at just stealing legal documents in order to sleep with them stuffed under his mattress.Case and White's voices both become curt and clipped as she confronts him on the fact that the robbers were after more than just the documents hidden in Case's safety box that contained the evidence of his crimes. She knows that he must have had true precious valuables and there's only one thing they could be; one international currency of high monetary worth all over the world--what the Nazis used to pay Case: diamonds. And as Case adds there was a Cartier ring of incalculable worth that belonged to a wealthy Parisian Jewish banker and his family. Case could have saved their lives but the Nazis gave him the ring to sell them out. Case writes White a check as payment for her services and she leaves with an unpleasant remark about how she is going to list him as a reference in the sale of a Manhattan co-op to Osama Bin Laden's nephew (the man she was interviewing in her first scene).Dalton is seen repeating his opening monologue. He is in his 'cell' holding one of the black velvet pouches looking at the diamonds inside it. He gathers a few belongings he has in his 'cell' turning out two small lights. He pushes out a wall in his cell and it is revealed that he was never in prison but in hiding--behind a false wall he and his cohorts had built in the bank supply room with enough provisions to wait it out until all the brouhaha over the robbery had simmered down. Putting the section of false wall back in place and replacing the heavy boxes that were in front of it He carefully but casually makes his way out into the public area of the bank.Across the street Kenneth/Steve Valerie/Stevie and Darius/Steve-O are waiting in an SUV. The camera pans along the SUV to show Chaim sitting with them--it turns out that he was part of the job all along too; the mastermind behind it.They see Frazier and Mitchell going into the bank and hurriedly call Dalton on his cell phone to warn him. Dalton asks if they're coming for him and they are not sure--it's just Frazier and Mitchell; nobody else.But Dalton is unafraid--he even goes so far to 'accidentally' bump into Frazier as he and Mitchell enter the bank apologizing to them as he continues on his way out and they do not notice or recognize him. Dalton walks out of the bank and into the waiting van where he is greeted with a kiss from Valerie and handshakes from Kenneth Darius and Chaim. When Chaim notes that Dalton doesn't have the ring with him Dalton says he left it in the safety deposit box but he assures Chaim it is in very good hands.As they all drive off Case's diamonds and legal documents in their possession and having escaped without so much as any suspicion on their heads Dalton gives a closing monologue in that he did the robbery for the money but speaks of how respect is the ultimate currency and that he knows that Case and other men like him will always have to face their pasts sooner or later.Frazier and Mitchell present Peter Hammond with a warrant and court order authorizing them to open safety deposit box 392. Inside the box they are surprised and amused to find an unfinished package of Juicy Fruit gum along with a few used gum wrappers... but they also find a jewelry box containing an exquisite gold and diamond ring and the box has a Cartier label. There is also a small piece of scrap paper with the words 'Follow the ring' scrawled on it.Frazier and Mitchell go to see Case at his office. What begins as a cordial conversation quickly degenerates into a heated confrontation as Frazier gradually reveals enough of what he's found during the investigation to show that he knows that Case hired Madeline White to keep Frazier reined in and that Case himself is guilty of some serious crimes. He shows Case the ring warning him that he is going to 'follow' it. As he walks down the street with Mitchell after leaving the office the two detectives share a laugh over how Frazier raked Case across the coals.Frazier goes to an exclusive diner where the mayor is having lunch with Madeline White. Frazier shows the mayor the ring and gives him a card with the phone number for a federal office responsible for prosecuting war crimes. He also gives White the pen with the incriminating recording he'd used as leverage against her. After Frazier leaves the mayor looks over the card wondering what kind of problems White has gotten him into.Frazier arrives home in the evening. Walking past Sylvia's brother who sleeps on a sofa in the living room he goes into the bedroom where he is greeted by Sylvia. As he stores away his gun and shield and his acknowledgement plaque for his promotion to First Grade he realizes there is a small object in his suitcoat pocket. Reaching inside he is stunned to find a small but beautifully cut diamond. He smiles to himself in amusement as he recalls his conversations with Dalton and realizes that Dalton was the man who bumped into him at the bank entrance... just as Dalton said he would he walked right out the door when he was 'good and ready.' Moreover as a sign of respect he slipped the diamond to Frazier so that the detective could now get a proper engagement ring made and propose to Sylvia.The movie closes with Sylvia calling Frazier to come to bed so they can make love."
A police detective a bank robber and a high-power broker enter high-stakes negotiations after the criminal's brilliant heist spirals into a hostage situation.::Anonymous
Composed and meticulous the soft-spoken and ingenious bank robber Dalton Russell has orchestrated the perfect heist--shortly the Manhattan bank at the corner of Wall Street and Broadway along with dozens of hostages will be his to command. Try as he might the rough hostage negotiator Keith Frazier is always one step behind the criminal mastermind--and what is more disheartening--the institution's silver-haired founder Arthur Case recruits the intelligent problem-fixer Madeline White to retrieve something of paramount importance. However the thieves seem to procrastinate intentionally when they should be rushing into action. Will Arthur and Madeline get what they want this time?::Nick Riganas
From a cell a man tells us he has planned the perfect bank robbery; he invites us to watch. An efficient gang enters a Manhattan bank locks the doors and takes hostages. They work deliberately without haste. Detective Frazier is assigned to negotiate but half his mind is occupied with the corruption charges he is facing. The bank's president has something to protect in a safe deposit box so he brings in Madeleine White a high-power broker with a hidden agenda. With an army of police surrounding the bank the thief the cop and the plutocrat's fixer enter high-stakes negotiations. Why are the robbers asking for a plane if they are so competent and they know they won't get one? Why aren't they in more of a hurry? If the job's perfect why is the thieves' leader in a cell?::<jhailey@hotmail.com>

Soon Kolchak learns that similar killings have been occurring in the Seattle area every twenty-one years for over 100 years. The trail soon leads to Seattle's underground city and he winds up meeting the killer who tells him that he uses the spinal fluid for a elixir which has been keeping him alive.

"A cautionary tale of love crime fantasy and addiction that follows two young Iowan lovers who decide to go into the ""batch"" business - cooking their own methamphetamine - only to watch it burn a searing hole in their lives.::Teri Kane at Rogers & Cowan"
"The movie begins in 1979 with a brief flashback establishing the long and tragic history of criminal activity within and by the Corleone family. Much has changed. Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is now approaching 60 and feels tremendous guilt for indulging in his ruthless ambition many years ago. Although his previous conquests have made him a very rich man the thoughts of his children their future happiness and his legacy are the only things keeping him going. His adopted brother Tom Hagen is now dead. The Corleone compound at Lake Tahoe is abandoned and in disrepair. Michael and Kay (Diane Keaton) divorced in 1959 and Michael gave her custody of their children Anthony (Franc D'Ambrosio) and Mary (Sofia Coppola).Michael has returned to New York City where he is using his enormous wealth and power to restore his dignity and reputation in the eyes of the public. The violent criminal element of the Corleone family has been largely abandoned ostracized by Michael as well as the public which no longer romanticizes the gangster lifestyle. Michael has embraced corporate America which is now more tolerant of Michael's nihilism. He has rebuilt the Corleone interests as a legitimate enterprise using the blood money from his gangster years. The thugs and sociopathic soldiers from Michael's past (Al Neri Willi Cicci Calo etc). have either died gone into the underground or have been relegated to the background serving as bodyguards for Michael and his family. Michael now struggles between repairing his fragile relationships while trying to contain the violent sociopaths that are still a part of his decaying criminal empire. In an attempt to break with the past Michael creates a charity the Vito Corleone Foundation in memory of his father. At a ceremony in St. Patrick's Cathedral presided over by Archbishop Gilday Michael is named a Commander of the Order of St. Sebastian. Kay who has remarried sits with Michael's children at the ceremony.At the lavish party following the ceremony Kay and Michael have a somewhat uneasy reunion. Anthony tells his father that he is going to drop out of law school to pursue a career as an opera singer. Kay supports his choice but Michael disagrees wishing that his son would finish law school or join the family business. Michael eventually acquiesces to Anthony's wishes. Meanwhile Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia) Sonny Corleone's illegitimate son (with Lucy Mancini) shows up at the party. He is embroiled in a feud with Joey Zasa (Joe Mantegna) the Corleone family's mafioso muscle who has been running the Corleone Family's crime businesses in New York for the past 20 years. What remains of the old Corleone criminal empire is now under Zasa's stewardship. However the Corleone's old neighborhood in New York's Lower East Side is in ruins and has become lawless.In Michael's study Vincent and Zasa tell him about their feud. The discussion grows violent with Vincent accusing Zasa of being an out-of-control monster who mocks Michael behind his back. Michael makes it clear that he is not ""a gangster"" and that whatever bad blood exists between Vincent and Joey Zasa is none of his business and must be settled between only them. He asks the two men to make peace with one another. The two men embrace but Zasa insults Vincent by whispering ""bastardo"" in his ear. Enraged Vincent bites off part of Zasa's ear. Zasa is escorted out and Michael scolds Vincent for his violent ways. However impressed by Vincent's passionate loyalty to protect him Michael agrees to take his nephew under his wing. The party concludes with a family picture where Michael asks Vincent to join the rest of the family.That night two men break into Vincent's apartment after Vincent has spent the night with a female journalist named Grace Hamilton (Bridget Fonda) whom he picked up at the party. Vincent brutally kills one in order to frighten the other into revealing Zasa as the man who sent them. Vincent then ruthlessly kills the second man.Later in an attempt to garner respectability and wealth for the Corleone Family through legitimate enterprise Michael seeks to buy the Vatican's shares in Immobiliare an international real estate holding company of which 25% is controlled by the Vatican. With the help of his new lawyer B.J. Harrison (George Hamilton) he negotiates the transfer of $600 million to the Vatican Bank with Archbishop Gilday who has plunged the Holy See into tremendous debt through his poor management and corrupt dealings. While in Vatican City Michael learns that several influential parties oppose the deal for many reasons not the least of which is the extensive criminal history that has tarnished the Corleone name. Because of this and the failing health of Pope Paul VI ratification of the deal will be far more complicated than he had anticipated.Don Altobello (Eli Wallach) an elderly New York mafia chief tells Michael that his old New York partners want in on the Immobiliare deal. A meeting is arranged in Atlantic City and Michael appeases most of the mafiosi with generous payoffs from their casino days. Zasa however gets nothing. Furious he declares that Michael is his enemy and tells everyone in the room they must choose between him and Michael. Zasa storms out of the meeting. Don Altobello runs after him to try and talk to him about this irrational move. Minutes later a helicopter hovers above the conference room and sprays a barrage of bullets through the ceiling windows. Almost everyone is killed but Michael Vincent and Michael's long-term bodyguard and caporegime Al Neri manage to escape. Back at his apartment in New York as Michael considers how to respond to this hit he suffers a diabetic stroke and is hospitalized. During the diabetic attack in a near-delirium Michael screams out the name of his brother Fredo whose murder he had ordered some 20 years earlier.Though they are cousins Vincent and Mary begin a romantic relationship. Unbeknownst to Michael Vincent with the urging of his aunt Connie plots revenge against Joey Zasa. During a street fair similar to that seen in The Godfather Part II Vincent and his accomplices kill Zasa's bodyguards and Vincent disguised as a mounted New York police officer shortly murders Zasa himself. Michael still hospitalized berates Vincent when he finds out but Vincent insists that he got the go-ahead from Al Neri and from Connie who has become deeply involved in family affairs. Michael insists that Vincent end his relationship with Mary because Vincent's involvement in the family puts Mary's life in jeopardy. Vincent agrees.The family travels to Sicily. Michael tells Vincent to speak with Don Altobello and in order to see where the old man's loyalties lie to intimate to him his intentions of leaving the Corleone family under the pretense that his affair with Mary still exists and that his loyalty to Michael has been supplanted by his desire to continue the relationship. Altobello supports the idea of Vincent switching his allegiance and introduces him to Licio Lucchesi the man behind the plot to prevent Michael's acquisition of Immobiliare.Michael also has lunch with Kay and asks forgiveness for his behavior 20 years earlier. He also tells her that he never planned to go into a life of crime. Kay admits that she still loves Michael and the two make plans to begin a new life together.Michael visits Cardinal Lamberto a well-intentioned and pious priest to speak about the Immobiliare deal. Lamberto convinces Michael to make his first confession in thirty years; among other sins Michael confesses to ordering the killing of his brother Fredo. After confessing Michael breaks down in tears. He is told by Lamberto that it is ""just that he should suffer"" and that although he could tell Michael to repent he knows Michael would not. Nevertheless he absolves Michael of his sins. Touring Sicily with Kay who has arrived for Anthony's operatic debut Michael also asks for her forgiveness. As both admit that they still love each other Michael receives word that Don Tommasino his Sicilian friend and ally of the Corleone Family for half a century has been killed (by a famous assassin) signaling that a new round of violence is about to begin. Cardinal Lamberto is elected Pope John Paul I which means that the Immobiliare deal will likely be ratified due to his intention to ""clean up"" the dealings of the Vatican. The new Pope's intentions come as a death knell to the plot against the ratification of the Immobiliare deal prompting frantic attempts by the plotters to cover their own tracks.Vincent tells Michael what he has learned from Altobello: Lucchesi is behind the plot against the Immobiliare deal and a master assassin known as Mosca da Montelepre (the man who killed Tommasino) has been hired by Altobello to kill Michael. Vincent wants to strike back but Michael cautions him saying that if he goes ahead with such a plan there'll be no going back. Vincent insists on revenge and Michael relents. He makes Vincent head of the Corleone family the new Godfather. In exchange for the promotion Vincent agrees to put an end to his heated relationship with Mary once and for all.The family travels to Palermo to see Anthony perform the lead in Cavalleria Rusticana at the renowned opera house Teatro Massimo. Meanwhile Vincent makes plans to seek revenge against the Corleone family's enemies.Interspersed with scenes from Anthony's performance are the brutal murders of the enemies of the Corleone family. Michael Corleone's theme Halls of Fear is mainly played during the murders:Keinszig is assaulted by Vincent's men. His body is hanged over the bridge to make his death an apparent suicide.Archbishop Gilday has the tea of the Pope poisoned. The Pope soon drinks it and dies.At the opera Don Altobello eats a dish of poisoned cannoli that his goddaughter Connie serves him. He soon dies silently at the opera as Connie watches through her opera glasses.Al Neri shoots Archbishop Gilday as he climbs a spiral staircase and flings the archbishop's body down the stairs.Finally Corleone 'button man' Calo (Franco Citti) approaches Don Lucchesi and whispers to his ear ""Power wears out those who do not have it"" before stabbing Lucchesi in the throat with his own pair of glasses killing him. Immediately Calo himself is killed by Lucchesi's bodyguards.Mosca the assassin hired by Don Altobello to kill Michael descends upon the opera house during Anthony's performance killing two of Vincent's men who delay his opportunity and the opera ends before he has the chance to kill Michael with his rifle. The assassin retreats to the opera house facade's staircase and tries to shoot Michael there. Mary is confronting her father about the forced break-up with Vincent when two shots ring out. The first hits Michael in the shoulder. The second hits Mary in the chest and she dies calling out to her father ""Dad?"" Vincent then kills the assassin with a single shot striking him in the chest. As Kay cradles Mary's bloody body in her arms Michael screams with primal pain and rage.The scene dissolves to a short montage of Michael's memories the first being a dance with Mary the second being a dance with his first wife Apollonia and the last being a dance with Kay. The film ends in an unspecified year showing an aged and broken Michael seated in the front yard of his Sicilian villa. He slowly puts on a pair of sunglasses drops an orange from his hand slumps out of his chair collapses to the ground and slowly dies completely alone. A small dog sniffs around his body and the screen fades to black as Mascagni's ""Intermezzo"" from Cavalleria Rusticana resolves to a high F major chord."

"Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) is released from a mental institution after being pronounced of sound mind by his psychiatrist Dr. Bill Raymond (Robert Loggia) after 22 years. At the hearing preceding Norman's release Lila Loomis (Vera Miles) shows up to protest producing a petition that she's been circulating with signatures of 743 people who do not want to see Norman return to society. Lila is the sister of Marion Crane one of Norman's victims (from the first film) and the widow of Sam Loomis who was Marion's boyfriend at the time of her death. When the judge refuses to acknowledge Lila's petition she vows to see Norman returned to the institution to pay for his crimes.Dr. Raymond takes Norman back to his old home the gloomy mansion on the hill behind the Bates Motel. A car is parked by the motel which belongs to Warren Toomey (Dennis Franz)--the current owner of the motel. Dr. Raymond offers to introduce Norman to him but Norman says it can wait until later. Walking up the steps to the house Norman thinks he sees someone in his mother's bedroom window. Dr. Raymond says there hasn't been a tenant in the house for years. Norman admits he is just nervous about being back after such a long time away.Inside the house all the furniture is covered up with sheets. Dr. Raymond asks Norman if he wants to stay somewhere else but Norman insists on being back at home. Dr. Raymond reminds Norman that with him living back at home the memories from his past are likely to reoccur but he is confident that Norman can handle it now. Dr. Raymond regrets that there won't be a trained social worker to check in on Norman occasionally due to budget cutbacks however Norman says that at least Dr. Raymond will come by from time to time to see him. Dr. Raymond informs Norman that the telephone has been reconnected and that he is to report to work at noon for a pre-arranged job as a short-order cook and dishwasher at a diner down the road from the motel.After Dr. Raymond leaves Norman takes his suitcase upstairs and picks up the phone receiver and hears the dial tone. He sees a piece of paper under the phone and picks it up. It is a note from Mother. It says ""Norman I'll be home late. Fix your own dinner. Love M."" Suddenly Norman is startled when he hears Mother's voice calling to him from her room. Norman then has a memory from his childhood. He sees his adolescent self reflected on the doorknob. Mother says ""Norman! What did you put in my tea? (sounds of a glass breaking) I'm gonna get you for this Norman. I'll show you what happens to bad little boys who poison their mothers--I'm gonna kill you! Her door slowly opens and then a hand falls to the floor writhes for a few seconds and then lays still. Her door slams shut and Norman lets go of his suitcase which tumbles down the stairs his clothes spilling out.Norman arrives at the diner and introduces himself to a kindly old woman named Emma Spool (Claudia Bryar) who works as a hostess waitress and cashier. She takes him back to the kitchen to meet Ralph Statler (Robert Alan Browne) the owner and short-order cook. Norman's other co-workers include a grouchy waitress named Myrna (Lee Garlington) and Mary Samuels (Meg Tilly) a young waitress who is less than stellar at her job only having worked there for the past four days. Emma Spool gets Norman an apron and tells him to take the meal orders while dishwashing and helping Ralph around the stove. When Mary accidentally knocks a pie plate off a table sending a piece of pie and a large knife to the floor. Ralph angrily asks her what happened. Norman covers for Mary and says that he did it. Ralph lets Norman off the hook and gets him started with some duties including reading off orders that the waitresses bring back.Later that night Norman leaves the diner and starts to head back home when he hears Mary shouting on a payphone arguing with her boyfriend. She hangs up the phone and when Norman asks what happened Mary claims she has been thrown out of her boyfriend's place and needs a temporary place to stay. Norman offers to let her stay at the motel for free. They start walking just as a thunderstorm is forming in the sky. They get back to the motel just as the rain starts pouring down. Norman goes into the office and reaches for the key to cabin #1 but he grabs a different key instead. He tells her to wait there while he checks the bed linen in the cabin. Then Warren Toomey enters startling Mary. He asks her if she wants to rent a room but she says that Norman is taking care of it. Norman comes back and tells Mary to go up to the house and wait for him. She leaves and Norman puts a handful of drug paraphernalia down on the desk and questions Warren about it. Norman discovers the motel is now a sleazy hookup location run by the equally sleazy Mr. Toomey. Norman fires Toomey and tells him to be gone by the next night.Back in the house Norman makes a sandwich for Mary. She finds a knife in a drawer and asks him to cut it for her and he is very nervous about holding a knife again. He reluctantly cuts the sandwich but Norman's odd behavior is creeping out Mary. She initially decides against staying with him but Norman convinces her to stay by telling her that this is the first night back in the house after being institutionalized for so long and is scared to be alone by himself. Norman takes her upstairs and gets some bedding for her to use. Mary goes into Norman's mother's room but Norman suggests she sleep in his room. Norman is apprehensive about going into his mother's room because he tells her that is where some of his ""troubles"" happened. Mary coaxes Norman into the room by reassuring him there are no ghosts in there. The room is mostly bare except for some of the furniture which is all covered up with more sheets. The bed mattress is rolled up as well. Norman goes into his room and tosses the bedding on top of his bed and closes the door so she can get settled in for the night. Norman says goodnight turns the lights off and sleeps on the couch downstairs. Mary jams the door shut from the inside by putting a chair underneath the doorknob.The next morning Norman is at the diner chopping lettuce when Mary comes in. She tells him she has decided to stay with a friend in town rather than with Norman. Just then a drunk Warren Toomey walks in and goes to the kitchen window and talks to Ralph and mockingly inquires about Norman's job performance and then he sits down in a booth. Norman is reading off more orders that are placed on a wheel while Ralph prepares the food. Mary starts to take Warren's order. Instead Toomey insults her and suggests that she and Norman had slept together the previous night. Norman is slowly becoming angry at Warren's remarks but tries to maintain his composure. Norman grabs an order off the wheel but instead it is a note from Mother! It says ""Don't let that whore in my house again!"" Norman is shocked by this and bumps into the french fry fryer spraying hot oil on Ralph's arm.Enraged Norman confronts Toomey and Toomey picks a fight with Norman in front of the customers. Norman sees a knife laying nearby and Warren goads Norman into picking it up and using it. Norman doesn't pick it up and Warren calls him a ""chicken"" and then leaves. Norman is so traumatized by seeing the note that he quits his job.Later that night Mary comes back to the house and tells Norman she has reconsidered and would like to stay with him. She was very impressed with how he handled Toomey earlier. Mary goes upstairs to take a shower. Afterward she has a funny feeling that she is being watched. In fact there is a small peephole cut into the wall opposite the shower and someone's eye is seen looking through the hole at her.Norman is playing the piano in the living room and is startled to hear a loud car horn blaring below. Warren Toomey is outside and he is very drunk and he is honking the horn to get Norman's attention. He shouts that he is packing his things and moving out. Then the phone rings. Norman answers it and after a pause he says angrily ""What? Who is this? My mother is dead! Mr. Toomey if this is you you're sicker than I ever was!"" Norman hangs up and looks out the front window. The lights to the office are still on and Norman is convinced it was Toomey who called. Just then a figure in a black dress comes into the office and murders Toomey by stabbing him as he packs to leave the motel. The murder goes unnoticed as ""Mother"" spends all night in the motel parlor cleaning up the evidence of her crime.The next day Norman's doctor Dr. Raymond pays a visit asking Norman why he quit his job at the diner and Norman tells Dr. Raymond that he has decided to dedicate himself to fixing up his motel to make it a legimate business. Norman also tells Dr. Raymond that he has been receiving notes as well as annymous phone calls from someone claiming to be his late mother. Dr. Raymond agrees to look into it.Up in the house Mary is putting on makeup when she sees a flicker of light relfected in the bathroom mirror and realizes that there is a small hole in the wall leading to Mother's bedroom. Worried Mary runs out of the house and down the hill where she meets with Norman still talking with Dr. Raymond. She casualy introduces herself to Norman's doctor and explains that she used to work at the diner as well and is now staying on the property to help Norman fix up his motel. Dr. Raymond thanks Norman for his time and drives away.Dr. Raymond goes to the police station in nearby Fairview where he meets Sheriff John Hunt (Hugh Gillin) and tells him about Norman telling him about receiving prank phone calls from someone claiming to be his mother and wants a tap put on Norman's phone but the sheriff refuses because there are no grounds for that nor has there been any evidence of a crime being committed as of yet. Dr. Raymond leaves and says that he will get to the bottom of what is going on at the Bates Motel.Later that day while painting part of the motel building Norman begins to doubt his sanity when he sees a figure standing in the window of this mother's old bedroom. He walks up to the house where he enters his mother's old bedroom to find it looks exactly as it did 22 years ago. A sound lures him into the attic where he is locked in by an unseen person.While he is up there another murder happens in the basement of the house: two teenagers sneak into the basement to smoke pot and make out but suddenly the figure in the black dress appears and knifes the boy to death. The girl escapes and later returns with the sheriff. In the meantime Mary finds Norman sleeping in the attic but the door is unlocked.The sheriff and his deputy arrive at the Bates house where they ring the doorbell and they question Norman and Mary (both of them clearly acting very tense) about the alleged murder. The sheriff investigates the fruit cellar where the killing took place hours earlier but finds it suspiciously neat and orderly. Norman is confused and wants to admit that something strange is going on but Mary interjects and claims that she has cleaned up the basement herself. Mary also give Norman an alibi by saying that she was with him all afternoon and they both were not in the house when the alleged murder took place. After the sheriff and deputy leave Norman is aghast. ""Why did you lie to the sheriff like that?"" he asks. Mary says ""I had to say something they were going to arrest you!""All the evidence suggests that Norman is back to his old ways but Mary is insistent. ""It couldn't have been you you're not like that anymore."" Later that evening Mary is startled when she discovers someone looking at her through the peephole in the bathroom wall. She calls out to Norman but Norman is downstairs and out of reach... so it can't be him. Mary draws a gun and starts checking the house but the gun saddens Norman. ""That's because of me isn't it?"" he says. They are horrified to find a bloody rag that someone has stuffed down the bathroom toilet. Norman is despondent convinced that his blackouts are re-ocurring and that he is responsible for the bloody rag and whatever crime it is connected with.Mary says she's going down to check the motel and one of the film's many plot twists occurs. In the parlor of the motel is Lila Loomis--Mary's mother. She's the one who has been calling Norman saying she's his mother even going so far as to dress up as her and allowing him to see her in the window before disappearing and adding to his frail mental state. Mary has been helping her and was responsible for restoring Mother's room at the house and locking Norman in the attic as well as leaving all of the notes from Mother for Norman to find at the house and at the diner but Mary's growing feelings for Norman have been causing her to reconsider her actions. It also explains how she knows Norman could not have been responsible for the murder of any young boy in the basement of the house because he was locked in the attic during that time. However Lila sees the murder as a happy coincidence not caring if Norman would be re-committed over a murder that wasn't his crime.The next day Dr. Raymond discovers Mary's true identity and informs Norman exactly who has been living with him. He also orders Norma Bates' body to be exhumed just to prove to Norman that she can't be the one haunting him.Back at the house when Norman confront's Mary she admits to Norman that she has been part of Lila's ruse but that Lila won't stop. ""Why did you stop?"" Norman asks. Just then the phone rings and Norman angrily answers it right away saying ""Hello Mrs. Loomis?"" Suddenly Norman's tone changes and he says ""I'm sorry... Mother."" Mary gets angry and picks up an extension to confront Lila but there's nobody on the line with Norman as whoever was on the other line hangs up when Mary speaks into the phone.Mary goes to Lila's hotel and they have a big fight that's overheard by a hotel bartender. Mary tells Lila that she wants her to stop bothering Norman and Lila accuses her of being in love with a psychopath. Lila convinced that she's winning the ""good"" fight hurries over to the house for one final push over the edge for Norman. She is being followed by Dr. Raymond.Lila sneaks into the cellar and removes her ""Mother"" costume from under a loose stone in the floor. However she is confronted by another ""Mother"" figure in a black dress and is killed with a butcher knife through the mouth. Dr. Raymond enters the house looking around and sees the cellar door wide open. He enters the cellar but no one is in sight (implying that ""Mother"" may have hid the body and slipped away through the cellar exit which is never locked). Norman enters the cellar and asks Dr. Raymond what is he doing there. The doctor tells Norman that he has been following Lila Loomis but Norman seems oddly disinterested making Dr. Raymond leave.Meanwhile Mary discovers that Mr. Toomey's car has been retrieved from the swamp with Toomey's body in the trunk. Sheriff Hunt questions Mary about being the daughter of Lila Loomis and that Dr. Raymond had visited him to inform him about his suspicions about her. When Mary overhears the sheriff talking to his deputies about bringing Norman in for questioning she slips away.Mary returns to the house and tries to get Norman to escape with her. ""They'll lock you up again!"" she pleads. Norman refuses to run and instead tries to get Mary to admit to what she's been doing to him. The phone rings at the house and Norman answers and starts to speak to his ""Mother"". But it is Dr. Raymond on the other line calling from the motel parlor who tells Norman that he contacted the local phone company and they had traced the phone calls to the house from the parlor phone at the motel. Once again Mary listens in and discovers that nobody is on the line with Norman (Dr. Raymond hangs up). But then Norman begins talking about Mary to the voice on the phone and says ""Oh no Mother. You can't make me... KILL her...""Terrified Mary goes down to the cellar and dresses up as Mother complete with a large butcher knife and goes to confront Norman in the outfit. It is at this point that things rapidly spiral out of control. Norman refuses to acknowledge Mary standing in front of him in the costume so Mary instead goes upstairs to the extension phone and tries to talk Norman into hanging up. But she hears on the other end that Norman is only talking to a dial tone... for there is no one on the other line. Mary realizes that Norman has turned completely insane again due to her and Lila's manipulation of events.Losing sight of Norman Mary is startled when someone grabs her from behind and she plunges the butcher knife into Dr. Raymond who has sneaked back into the house to expose Norman's tormentors. Stabbed Raymond's body falls over the balcony and lands in the foyer. Mary runs downstairs and is confronted by a now deranged Norman who swears to cover up for ""Mother."" ""Norman I am not your mother I am Mary!"" she frantically tells him. Norman tries to reach for the knife but Mary stabs him in the chest. Norman backs Mary down the steps into the basement and Mary keeps stabbing Norman once in the palm of each hand. Norman grabs the knife blade firmly with both hands with Mary still holding onto the other end which severely cuts Norman's palms even further and a lot of blood pours out. Norman is weak from blood loss and stumbles on a pile of coal knocking it loose and revealing Lila's body. Mary distraught at seeing her mother's dead body attacks him and is killed when the police enter and shoot her dead.At the police station that evening the sheriff puts together a fairly inaccurate account of the what we know has happened identifying Mary as the murderer of the teenage boy as well as Toomey and that she may have killed Lila as well. Having received medical treatment for his wounds Norman is sitting a short distance away in a daze and goes along with the story... and the movie goes on to its final twist.Norman returns to the Bates house where he shovels coal into the house furnace as well as wanders aimlessly around the house now alone. A little later Norman makes a sandwich for himself when a woman walks up the steps. Norman has boiled water and set a place for a meal when there is a knock at the back door; he answers the door to find Emma Spool from the diner. Ms. Spool sits at the table and Norman gives her a cup of poison tea. Out of the blue Norman asks her ""Are you really my mother?"" She tells him that she is his real mother and that Norma Bates was her sister and his aunt. ""I was too young to have a baby besides I had problems of my own"" she tells him alluding to the fact that she as well was institutionalized. ""You had already been put away by the time I got out. So I decided to wait for you."" She reveals that she's the one who has been killing anybody who would make trouble for her son. As she sips the poison tea she begins to gag.Norman suddenly kills her with a blow to the head with the coal shovel. Emma's chair collapses underneath her and she tumbles onto the floor. As she lies dying Norman closes the curtains to the kitchen and then picks up her body and carries her upstairs to his mother's room. The audience hears the familiar voice of Mother warning Norman not to go messing with ""filthy girls"" again. The final shots show Norman (murderously psychotic once again) reopening the Bates Motel and standing in front of the house... waiting.

After twenty-two years of psychiatric care Norman Bates attempts to return to a life of solitude but the specters of his crimes - and his mother - continue to haunt him.
Now declared legally sane Norman Bates is released from a mental institution after spending 22 years in confinement over the protests of Marion Crane's sister Lila Loomis who insists that he's still a killer and that the court's indifference to his victims by releasing him is a gross miscarriage of justice. Norman returns to his motel and the old Victorian mansion where his troubles started and history predictably begins to repeat itself.::alfiehitchie

"The Raven--synopsis**NOTE: Spencer Charters was billed as  Geoffrey  Pinkey in the credits but actually played Col. Bertram Grant.Ian Wolfe was billed as  Col. Bertram Grant  in the credits but actually played Geoffrey.The character of Dr. Jerry Holden is listed in the credits and captions as Jerry Halden.They are listed below in their correct associations.**Dancer Jean Thatcher (Irene Ware) is driving fast in a rainstorm. Losing control she crashes and is brought to a nearby hospital. After examination by several doctors who say they cant do anything for her Jeans fiancé Dr. Jerry Holden (Lester Matthews) suggests Dr. Richard Vollin (Bela Lugosi) formerly associated with the hospital but now a recluse doing only research.Meanwhile Dr. Vollin is heard reciting Edgar Allan Poes  The Raven  to museum curator Chapman (Arthur Hoyt) who tries to buy Vollins collection of Poe memorabilia. He is told about his torture devices but is rushed out by Vollin.A phone call to Vollin is made who refuses to help citing that the other doctors are competent. Her father Judge Thatcher (Samuel S. Hinds) takes the phone and begs Vollin to save his daughters life. He refuses and hangs up. Finding out where the doctor lives he goes to Vollins home and continues begging in person. Vollin appears to have no compassion or sympathy for her and refuses. Thatcher appeals to him as a doctor who has taken an oath to which Vollin replies I make no such oath. I am a law unto myself. Death hasnt the same significance for me as it has for you Vollin concludes. Insisting that Vollin save her life Thatcher is told by Vollin that the other doctors are competent. It is only when told that everyone says that Dr. Vollin is the only one who can save her that he rises puffed up saying So they DO say that I'm the only one? Very well I will go.The operation proceeds with Vollin being shown as having an unusual interest in the patients beauty.One month later Jean is being entertained by Vollin in his home. Having listened to him play Bachs Toccata and Fugue in D Minor  on organ she gushes that Vollin is not only a brilliant surgeon but a great musician. She intimates that maybe he is more than an extraordinary man to which he eagerly answers a god? With the taint of human emotions. She tells him she wishes she could repay him for saving her life. Clutching her and staring into her eyes he tells her the restraint we put upon ourselves can drive us mad. Uncomfortable she makes an excuse to leave reminding him of her performance the following night. Nothing can keep me away he promises. She tells him she will have a surprise for him that night and leaves.The next evening a show marquee sign tells of her performance in a dance interpretation of Poes  The Raven . She dances while a man dressed as Poe (Raine Bennett) recites the poem. In one of the balcony box seats Thatcher observes Vollin madly obsessing over his daughters performance.Afterwards backstage Jerry reassures Jean that the audience liked her performance saying that twelve encores was enough. Entering the dressing room to congratulate her include Pinkey (Ian Wolfe) and Mary Burns (Inez Courtney) her father and Dr. Vollin who kisses her hand gushing about her surprise Poe interpretation. Again Thatcher observes Vollin taking more than a casual interest in Jean.The next day Thatcher arrives at Vollins to tell him to leave Jean alone. She is in danger of becoming infatuated with you. We cant let her get any ideas about you can we?  the judge intones She is engaged to young Jerry Holden he tells Vollin. Speaking of his interest in Jean Vollin crushes a test tube in his hand. This convinces Thatcher that Vollin is seriously involved in a similar infatuation. Told to leave her alone Vollin insists that the judge bring his daughter to him. I find you stark staring mad Thatcher tells him and leaves.Edmond Bateman (Boris Karloff) an escaped convict trying to disguise himself is given the address of Dr. Vollin in a local tavern. He arrives that evening and is invited into Vollins office. When Vollin addresses him by name Bateman wants to know who told him. It is explained that Batemans violent prison break and photo were in the newspapers. Vollin seems very interested that Batemans bank robbery and mutilation of a bank cashier's face with an acetylene torch was especially torturous. Come to ask Vollin to change his face so he will not be recognized Bateman is promised help but only if he agrees to commit murder and torture. Desperate he agrees and is told the alteration will be done now. Bateman is led into a room and made to lie on a table for surgery.Later a bandaged Bateman is checked on by the doctor. When the patient awakens Vollin raises him up vertically and begins slowly removing the bandages. As his face is revealed half of it is shown to be horribly disfigured and one eye dislocated. Bateman speaks in a raspy voice asking if he looks different. Yes Vollin replies with noted glee. Feeling something is not right with his face Bateman feels with his fingers and demands to see his reflection. Dr. Vollin agrees and leaves the room telling him to wait. As Bateman gets up and looks around several curtains are opened revealing a series of large mirrors each one reflecting the ugliness of Bateman one by one. Horrified he begins shooting breaking each mirror. From a grate near the ceiling Vollin appears laughing hysterically at Batemans misery. Having run out of bullets Bateman frustratingly throws the gun at Vollin's face.Moments later Vollin asks Bateman if he is ready to do the murder job telling him he must answer yes or no. Bateman insists that his face be fixed but Vollin says he must do this job for him first. He agrees. Vollin returns to the room a moment later giving Bateman some clothes to put on and then report for further instructions.Having invited Jean Jerry Pinkey Mary and Col. Bertram Grant (Spencer Charters) and his wife Harriet (Maidel Turner) to a party they make bets on a horserace game which is mechanically run in Dr. Vollins home. At one point Jean announces she will have to go upstairs to fix her hair and does so which is noted by Vollin and Bateman who now serves as the butler. Meanwhile Judge Thatcher arrives home to find Vollins written invitation to the party to which also a note added that Jean and Jerry decided to go and for her father to join them.When Thatcher arrives Vollin immediately apologizes for what he said the other day asking him to forgive him. The judge seems reluctant but is quickly reassured by Vollin who joyfully leads him into the party. Bateman is told to go upstairs and tell Jean her father has arrived. When he opens the door and Jean sees Bateman in the mirror behind her she screams and runs downstairs into her fathers arms. Everyone crowds around as she tells of this awful man who came into her room. Vollin interrupts and tells everyone to come and sit while he tells the story of his servants unfortunate disfigurement. His guests are told with some relish how he served with Vollin in his regiment and was tortured by the enemy who mutilated his face. Describing his interest in death and torture he makes a reference to Poe. Jean asks what is Vollins interpretation of  The Raven  and is told that Poe was a great genius who was denied his love Lenore. Getting tired it is suggested that they all retire to their rooms for the night and they begin going upstairs. When Jean passes Bateman she apologizes saying she was suddenly surprised and would not have screamed if she had known. Bateman sees this sympathetic gesture and acts as if he wants to tell his secret. Vollin notices Bateman talking to Jean and is concerned.Outside a windy thunderstorm is beating down trees.Upstairs Judge Thatcher is shown to his room by Vollin who is called over by Col. Grant and asked about drafts in the house. Assured they will be comfortable the Colonel and his wife go upstairs to the third floor where their room is. Thatcher comes into Jeans room with Jerry and begins ranting again about Vollin being mad and dangerous. He tells the couple to come home with him now. His fears are laughed at by Jerry who says Vollin is just being amusing and is too reputable and distinguished a surgeon to be considered dangerous. Against his better judgment Thatcher resigns himself to stay the night but not before Jerry announces that he will switch rooms with Jean for her protection.Knocking on the door and entering Bateman comes in to try to tell Judge Thatcher what is going on. Vollins voice is heard calling Bateman. Coming to the door he chastises Bateman into going downstairs. Trying to reassure his guests Vollin apologizes and says his servant probably just wanted to see if he could help them. Jean says they are now comfortable and Vollin bids them goodnight.Going down into a dungeon below Vollin shows Bateman his instruments of torture telling him many are described by Poe in his writings. He says they are very old but warns ready for use.
He shows Bateman a slab with manacles for feet and arms to hold a man still for the Pit and Pendulum device. Getting up on the slab to demonstrate Vollin shows how a man may be held captive by throwing a lever. Bateman quickly throws the lever which traps Vollin. Gotcha! Bateman says grimly. As the pendulum swings slowly back and forth over him Vollin tells Bateman to release him reminding him that should anything happen to me you remain the horrible monster you are. Bateman reluctantly releases him. Vollin tells him the blade descends upon the victim in fifteen minutes time which can be seen on a clock built into the stone wall.Later Bateman comes up through a trap door into Jeans room but suddenly the wind causes a tree to crash through the window awakening Jean. Looking around she sees Bateman who retreats and closes the trap door. She screams and runs to Jerrys room telling him she is frightened. They go into her room and Jerry tells her its only a tree which the storm blew into the window. She says she saw a man coming up through the floor which he amusingly thinks is her imagination. He tells her to sleep in his room and he will stay in hers.In Vollins office he tells Bateman at gunpoint to leave the girl alone and strikes him with a small whip. Just then a knock at the door interrupts them. The Colonel wants a sleeping powder for his wife. Dr. Vollin comes back with two powders telling him there is one for each of them. Vollin tells Bateman that now the job will begin.Sneaking into Thatchers room Bateman strong-arms him out of bed and downstairs to the torture chamber. Along the way Thatchers cries are heard by Jerry who attempts to locate him. They enter Vollins study through the bookcase panel entrance into a passageway down below. Bateman punches Jerry and prevents him from entering closing the door. Below Thatcher is brought before a waiting Vollin who apologizes to the judge for the savagery of his servant. Bateman is told to put Thatcher on the slab. The blade is turned on and Thatcher asks about it. Vollin tells him it will reach him in fifteen minutes. He explains that he is the sanest man of all because he removes torture from his life by torturing others. Judge Thatcher nervously watches the swinging pendulum as Vollin laughs maniacally. Meanwhile Jerry comes to and tries to find how to open the bookcase entrance.Vollin goes to a master control and throws a switch which lowers Jeans bedroom down to the dungeon. He watches Jean screaming as the large elevator reaches the bottom where he is laughing at her. Closing the door he seems amused by her cries. Unable to open the panel Jerry runs upstairs to Jeans room and opens the door as he hears her cries. Holding onto the doorknob he swings in midair where the room has been lowered. He is barely able to recover and go out the door again. He calls for the others to help him and they follow. He explains that Jean and her father have been taken and to wake the Grants. A few minutes later Jerry is told that the Grants seem to have been drugged and cannot be awakened. They try to find the opening to the bookcase panel. Jerry picks up the phone to call but this is anticipated by Vollin who switches off the phones from his control. At the same time another switch lowers steel shutters on all the windows sealing them in.Vollin tells Bateman to quiet the girl. As he goes to do this Vollin tells Thatcher that he has  a most delightful plan for her. Bateman opens the door and tells Jean he said to stop. She stares at his face. He tells her he knows he is ugly and that Vollin did it. Saying Vollin is mad she asks Bateman to help her get out. He says no because the doctor will fix his face. She tells Bateman that Vollin wont help him but that she will. He is called back by Vollin and told to attend to Thatcher.Vollin now opens the bookcase door and Jerry says he will go in. The others follow. Finding a passageway leading downstairs to the dungeon Jerry sees Bateman standing by Thatcher and a fight ensues. Vollin holds a gun on Jean. Jerry runs to where Jean is standing with Vollin. Bateman approaches and holds Jerry. Meanwhile Thatcher tells the others to release him from the slab. When told the lever is locked Thatcher tells them the servant must have the key. They rush in and see Jean and Jerry held at gunpoint by Vollin. He tells them they are in time for a wedding. He tells Bateman to open the room door and then tells Jean and Jerry to go in. The switch is thrown to close the steel door. They are told they will remain in this room forever and that their love will make it beautiful. Bateman comes over and asks Vollin what happens in that room. He is told that it is another of Poes stories: the room where the walls come together. Dr. Vollin now loudly proclaims that his torture is complete and that Poe is avenged. Bateman asks if they will be crushed. Vollin says yes telling Bateman that he will fix his face now. Again Bateman asks if the girl will be crushed to death and is told yes. He tells Vollin no and goes to throw the switch. Vollin threatens him and when the switch is thrown Bateman is shot and staggers. Getting the key Pinkey goes and frees Thatcher.There is a struggle between Bateman and Vollin who is knocked out and dragged into the room by Bateman as the couple emerges. Bateman rushes to close the door. Vollin cries out to Bateman as the door closes and the walls close in to crush him. When Bateman and Vollin are dead Mary screams and says we forgot the Grants! They are shown snoring in their beds.Jean and Jerry are seen driving home and she says she was almost crushed. He jokes that he will finish the process only softer. She tells him that he is now the big bad raven."

"Twenty-one year-old Chris McCormick (Margaux Hemingway) is a top model for a company selling lipstick. McCormick has responsibility for her 14 year-old sister Kathy (Mariel Hemingway) as their parents were killed in a car crash. They share an apartment and Kathy attends a private Catholic school.Kathy invites her handsome young music teacher Gordon Stuart (Chris Sarandon) to come to one of Chris's photo shoots along the ocean because she wants her older sister to hear his somewhat avant garde musical compositions. The shoot runs long so Chris does not have a chance to hear it but arrangements are made for him to stop by her apartment the next day to play it for her.The next day Stuart arrives at the apartment but Chris has forgotten the appointment and this causes her to greet him fresh out of the shower dressed in nothing but a robe. Stuart obviously hopes that if she likes his music she might be able to use some of her musical connections to help him. While he is playing a selection from his tape recorder (the composition uses a lot of environmental sounds with electronic synthesizers) Chris is interrupted with a phone call from her boyfriend Steve Edison (Perry King) and retreats to her bedroom.The interruption and Chris's apparent apathy toward his music enrages Stuart and he enters her bedroom smashing things and hitting her. He then throws her naked across her four poster bed and secures her spread-eagle on her stomach with silk scarves to the posts and sodomizes her.Toward the end of the rape Chris has stopped struggling so when little sister Kathy arrives home from school she enters the apartment and hears nothing amiss. She walks into Chris's bedroom via a connecting balcony and sees the scene but does not realize that Chris is being forced against her will so she leaves quietly shutting the patio door behind her.Chris hears the patio door shut and realizes that Kathy must be home and begs Stuart to release her. After half-jokingly suggesting they make it ""threesome"" he does noting that Kathy must think ""her sister just made it with her favorite teacher."" Stuart leaves and a crying Chris stumbles to Kathy who finally realizes that something is wrong.The police arrive and gather evidence while Chris talks to a rape-crisis counselor. Later that night the police pick up Stuart and take him to jail.A few days later Chris Edison and Chris's priest/brother Martin (John Bennett Perry) meet with district attorney Carla Bondi (Anne Bancroft). Bondi warns Chris that getting a conviction under these circumstances (she invited him to her apartment) will not be easy. Edison also has his doubts about pressing charges as he fears it may damage Chris's career. Chris makes it clear that she want to go ahead however.Stuart's attorney Nathan Cartright (Robin Gammell) does everything he can to raise doubt in the jury's mind about whether the encounter was consentual even bringing in Chris's sexy pictures from the photo shoot in an attempt to besmirch her reputation. However in the end it is Chris's own sister's testimony that gets Stuart off the hook: despite Kathy's protests that she believes her sister's story it is clear that the afternoon of the attack Kathy's failure to call the police after seeing them together in the bedroom is a clear indication that she did not think at the time that her sister was being raped. The jury acquits Stuart.Chris tries to go back to work but it is clear that she cannot focus her attention on her modeling and the lipstick company decides to suspend her contract. Kathy switches schools as it looks like Stuart may get his old job back.Kathy is watching her older sister at one final shoot being done at a partly completed mall complex and gets bored. She starts exploring the empty mall and stumbles across Stuart and some of her former classmates preparing a dance performance to his music. When the classmates leave Stuart sees her and invites her to help him with the final mixing of his composition. She approaches and lets him place a contact microphone on her chest to record her heartbeat to add to the music. We hear her heartbeat suddenly speed up as Kathy realizes that Stuart is making sexual advances toward her. She runs and he chases her through the empty mall until he catches her in a sub-basement tunnel. There we see him start to tear her clothes off....Kathy stumbles back to the part of the mall where the photo shoot is going on. She crying and her clothes are torn. Chris asks what happened. At first Kathy tells her nothing but then admits she ran into Stuart and he attacked her.Chris races to the window and sees Stuart leaving the building. She runs down to her truck and gets a rifle she has in the back and shoots Stuart as he is driving from the parking lot. He crashes his car then climbs out but is shot again and again by Chris including a shot to his genitals. She continues to try and pump bullets into his dead body even after he has stopped moving and the gun is empty. The police arrive and arrest Chris who is in a state of shock. As the camera pulls away from the scene we hear Bondi who has apparently left the D.A's office to defend Chris tell the jury during Chris' murder trial that justice can only be served if they acquit Chris of Stuart's murder.

Prominent local figure Archer Coe was found dead locked inside his bedroom by butler Gamble. His secretary Raymond Wrede called the police.Detective Sergeant Heath was the first to arrive to the crime scene followed by district attorney Markham and his friend amateur sleuth Philo Vance.With the helpful hints dropped by Philo the coroner completed his examination and deduced that Archer Coe did not commit suicide but was murdered. The following rounds of questioning revealed that Archer Coe was not a popular man and just about everyone around him has a reason to kill him.The main suspects are:Archer's beautiful niece Hilda Lake whom he obsessed about and kept under his control by abusing his position as the executor of her trust.Hilda's lover Sir Thomas MacDonald whose prize-winning dog was believed to be maliciously killed by Archer.Archer's mistress Doris Delafield who lived in an apartment building right next to his mansion was cheating on him with Eduardo Grassi.Eduardo Grassi representing an Italian museum was about to lose the deal with Archer to buy the collection because Archer found out about him and Doris.And lastly Heath's favourite suspect Archer's brother Brisbane; with whom Archer had a serious brotherly feud with.After an enthusiastic pursuit after the missing Brisbane Heath's hope of using his handcuff within the day failed when they found Doris' dog wounded and Brisbane dead both hidden in Archer's mansion. The team was back where it started.Philo's investigation also brought out surprising new information on Archer's servants. Archer's Chinese cook Liang was really a graduate from Columbia who specialises in antiques; Gamble was a reformed professional gambler; and Wrede hated his boss and was looking for a new job.It turned out that Archer was killed twice. First it was Wrede who both hit and stabbed him when Archer refused to give his consent for him to propose to Hilda. Thinking that Archer was dead Wrede hit Doris' dog with the murder weapon as it has strolled into the house at the wrong time. But Archer was not dead he just fainted. He woke up not realising that he was dying walked up stairs and began to change for bed. Before he could change into his slippers the internal hemorrhage caught up to him and he died in a sitting position.Brisbane who had been reading a detective novel decided to use the plots described in the story to kill his brother. Not realising that Archer's already dead he staged the suicide and used a trick he learned from the book to bolt the door from the outside.When Brisbane was closing Archer's bedroom window Wrede saw him through his apartment window and decided to come back and finish the job. Mistaking Brisbane as Archer he killed him and hid both his and the dog's bodies in the closets.Philo now knew how Archer died and why his death appears to be both murder and suicide but he had no way of making Wrede confess. He conspired with Markham to release all of the suspects; and with the help of Sir Thomas and Hilda finally got Wrede to confess to the crime.

It takes only a few minutes for Philo to convince Det. Sgt. Heath that it's murder. Finding the murderer isn't as easy however as Archer Coe was ruthless and had many enemies.::garykmcd

"At night on a seedy street of New Orleans we see an upper floor window that is thrown open. In that room a poker game is under way. One of the players is seaman Kochak (Lewis Charles) who gathers a large pot he has just won and says he feels sick and needs to go rest. The other players object Blackie (Jack Palance) Raymond Fitch ( Zero Mostel) and Poldi (Guy Tomajan) claiming that it was too early to quit. Despite threats Kochak leaves. Blackie quickly talks to the other two ordering them to bring back Kochak or the money. Raymond and Poldi follow Kochak out stop him and push him but Kochak continues on his way. Raymond and Poldi are giving up but an angry Blackie demands that he be followed. Some distance away in the dock area Kochak is surrounded there is a brief fight. Blackie kills Kochak with two shots and orders Raymond and Poldi to get rid of the body after retrieving the money.The next morning Dr. Clinton Reed a U.S. Public Health Service officer (Richard Widmark) is at home looking forward to a day off with his wife Nancy (Barbara Bel Geddes) and son Tommy (Tommy Rettig) We see him as a family man painting furniture with his young son. Later he and the wife discuss how it appears they can't make ends meet with his salary as there are bills that have gone unpaid for quite a while.From a dock on the river front the dead body of Kochak has been spotted and policemen pick it up and take it to the morgue. The coroner technician digs out the two bullets and notices something strange with the body. Immediately he isolates the body and phones Dr. Reed at home.Dr. Reed reluctantly agrees to come back to the morgue and confirms the dead man had pneumonic plague similar to bubonic plague but attacking the lungs and transmitted not by rats but by coughing and sneezing and physical contact among people. He takes charge isolates everyone who touched the body has the body cremated and starts inoculating the policemen and morgue technicians.At a hastily summoned emergency meeting with mayor Murray (H. Fowler Jr.) police chief Tom Warren (Paul Douglas) and other authorities Reed describes the potentially enormous consequences and deaths that could ensue from not finding those infected. Death occurs within four days of the onset of illness and illness within about two days of contagious exposure. So they have a 48 hour window to try to find those exposed and prevent further illnesses by inoculations.Since the dead man was moved by his killers the killers have been exposed and must be found. The search has to be done with a different excuse otherwise the killers might leave town and potentially infect the whole nation. The secret must also be kept from the public otherwise there would be a mass exodus that might spread the illness through a vast area.The mayor supports Reed the rest go along very reluctantly. Warren objects that he has an impossible job because the murder victim is unidentified but grumblingly he promises to do his best. Reed and Warren display short tempers and grudging respect for each other as they start off on their search for the killers.Warren orders a round up of all known petty criminals and suspects who are shown a picture of the murder victim and are asked what they know. Reed is so involved an intense that he gets in the way of the police procedures so he goes on his own to try other ways to identify the murder victim.Dr. Reed goes into the seamens hiring hall and offers a $50 reward to anyone who can identify the murder victim to no avail. He senses there is a reluctance to give information so he announces he will wait at a nearby café Franks Place just in case anyone wants to talk to him. After some waiting a girl comes to him and says she thinks she knows a boat owner who might have seen the unidentified victim. Reed follows her to a boat and the owner denies knowing anything. After some pushing the owner says he also owns a café that is run by his wife and will ask his wife.At the café the wife is consulted by her husband out of sight from Reed. She recognizes the man but refuses to admit it. She complains of having a headache and she starts to cough.Meantime Blackie Raymond and Poldi have sensed that the police is after something important and Blackie guesses that the dead man who was Poldi's cousin is much more important than one would guess from a merchant seaman and imagine that Kochak had information about some treasure or drug stash.A scene in Blackies supposed legitimate business serves to define the characters of both Blackie and Raymond. Blackie argues with Raymond and his shrewish wife (Liswood) and shows Raymonds frantic subservience as he tries to pacify each like some berserk pinball.There are brief scenes where Blackie's complex character is further developed. When a stunning prostitute asks Blackie for $100 (the equivalent of $1000 in 2010) he doesn't hesitate. When a little newspaper seller gives him some information he insists on giving money to him although he doesn't want it. When a doctor tells him that the man he is trying to kill is sick and needs an expensive sanitarium Blackie quickly offers the money. He may be a killer but he sure is generous.The film intersperses small scenes that grab attention simply by making the characters and their little exchanges interesting. Like the Irish dwarf for instance who refuses to take payment for his favors looking up at the towering Blackie saying ""No Blackie no."" And then after Blackie stuffs the bills into his sweater he hobbles away backwards and saying ""God bless ye Blackie God bless ye.""In the same vein Reeds character is developed as struggles with his status as a nearly absentee dad slaving away at a job that pays him poorly and barely managing to spend any time with his wife and son. The $50 reward he offers for information means the bill he was going to pay will have to wait.Blackie starts to suspect Poldi of holding out on him since Kochak was Poldi's cousin so Poldi disappears trying to get away from Blackie.Meantime the wife of the café owner has been taken to a hospital and dies from the plague. Her husband arrives and Dr. Reed is able to extract more information due to the heavy guilt and grief. Kochak is identified as having arrived in a ship called the Queen of the Nile which is still within reach of the authorities.The ship is boarded and despite the Captains denials and lack of cooperation Reed succeeds in questioning the crew and finds that there had been a recent death on board. The interview of two Asian cooks aboard the Nile Queen is hilarious -- ""He cawr me dirty names and ask for Shishabob!"" Later loudly proclaiming that the crew will start dying in just a few days Reed succeeds in convincing the seamen to get inoculated. The captain yields as his crew starts to mutiny.During these searches three times Reed just misses meeting up with Raymond. The viewer is tantalized with both men in the same frame but unaware of the connection between them.The film has a subplot in which a news reporter who wears his ""Freedom of Speech"" as a badge of honour is shut down and locked away in a jail to prevent him from publishing a story that might indeed trigger panic in the streets. This is a decision by the mayor at the urging of Reed that gives rise to a brief discussion of Constitutional rights.Eventually Blackie finds and interrogates the dying Poldi as to the precise nature of his cousin's presumed contraband. Cat like Blackie stalks his victim across the room eventually preying over the doomed man's sick bed holding Poldi's feverish head in his hands. Meantime Poldi's mother has summoned a nurse whose entrance prevents Blackie from torturing the dying Poldi. She is aware of the seriousness of Poldi's condition and refuses to leave. Blackie summons his own doctor and the doctor expels the nurse who manages to get messages to Reed about the situation. Were it not for the serendipitous perceptive nurse Reed and Warren might still be looking for the killers.The doctor together with Blackie Fitch start to move Poldi out of his room and down some stairs and this is when they meet up with Reed. Poldi is thrown down to his death and an exciting chase follows. Blackie and Raymond hijack a van to flee as they are being chased by Reed Warren and half the New Orleans Police first in 1949 Ford police cars then on foot after the van is surrounded. The two escaping killers try to throw off the pursuers in a coffee and bananas warehouse where they hide among the mountains of burlap coffee bags. At one point Reed enters and yells at them that they will die unless they surrender and get inoculated.The weight challenged Raymond trying to keep up with Blackie is a source of shots that would be funny except for the circumstances.After Raymond is captured in the final chase shots Blackie is on the run at the water level under the wooden docks with the police hot on his tail. Trying to escape on a fruit boat headed towards South America the dirty and murderous rat Blackie is prevented from getting on board by the ship's rat shield causing him to end up in the water where he is eventually captured.The final shots symbolize that the emergency is over as the exhausted Reed returns to his family."

"(some of the following content first appeared on realmoviereview.com)Fenton Meiks (Matthew McConaughey) walks into an FBI office late one evening and announces that he has information about a serial killer known as the God's Hands Killer that he will only give to the lead investigator. When Agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Boothe) arrives Meiks says the killer is his brother Adam who has just died. Fenton is cool and distant and Doyle is obviously skeptical. Fenton admits to stealing his brother's body and an ambulance to fulfill a promise to bury him in the ""rose garden"" and Doyle confirms this story by calling a small town sheriff's office. Fenton does not answer Doyle's direct questions about why Fenton knows Adam is the killer. Instead he begins a long involved tale about his family history.The small family of auto mechanic Dad (Bill Paxton) and two boys has survived the loss of their mother. Twelve year old Fenton (played by Matt OLeary) is cooking meals and supervising his younger brother Adam (played by Jeremy Sumpter).In the middle of one night their father wakes them to say he's received a message from God. An Angel appeared to him saying that they (Dad and the boys) have been selected to be God's Hands and cleanse demons from the world. He's been told to wait and God will provide weapons and more information. Adam is excited about being a crime-fighting superhero but Fenton is alarmed asking if Dad just dreamt it or imagined it. Dad is sure it was real but admits he doesn't know how it will all work and admonishes the boys to keep it secret. He says if they tell ""someone will die.""Fenton's hopes that the idea will go away are dashed by subsequent events. Dad is drawn to ordinary-looking items by a beam of light from above and proudly bears them home as weapons provided by the Angel: an axe some gloves a length of pipe. One night Dad comes home excited showing a list of names the angel gave him in another vision. Fenton still can't believe this is happening. Dad states that these are not people they are demons and destroying them is God's will.Fenton hears a sound another night and looking outside sees Dad carrying a wrapped body over his shoulder. Dad summons both boys to the shed out back where he drops the woman alive. She has tape over her mouth and her hands and feet are tightly bound. Dad removes the gloves as he's realised that touching a demon with his bare hands will reveal its true nature. He fearfully reaches towards her. When Dad's hand contacts her arm his body stiffens and he seems electrified shaking rapidly with an horrified expression. Dad sure now that she is a demon takes the axe and swings it high in the air toward her and there's the sound of it striking home.Dad digs a grave in the rose garden behind the house. Fenton is crying that Dad has killed someone while Dad is only sad that Fenton could not see her demon nature. Adam insists that he was able to see it but Fenton says Adam is just lying.At times during this tale Agent Doyle has pressed the adult Fenton for answers which he does not always give. Fenton offers to prove it to show him the rose garden where the bodies are buried. Doyle has him put on cuffs and get in the secured back seat of a car and begins driving to the site. Fenton continues to tell the tale in response to Doyle's questions.Dad acquires a van and they seek out their next target an older man who is walking into a grocery store. Dad explains that even in broad daylight God will protect them from being seen. Dad forces Fenton to take part in the ruse to capture the man: pretending to call a dog out from under the man's car. As Dad knocks the man out Fenton runs away crying but cannot sum up the courage to tell the police and turn Dad in for murder.Dad assigns Fenton to dig a massive pit in the backyard and charges him to pray to accept God's will for their family's work. Fenton angrily digs for days refusing gloves for his bleeding hands and does not find spiritual comfort. They board the sides of the pit and add a roof then slide the shed on top of it creating a small cellar ... aware of its purpose Fenton calls it a dungeon.When the next victim is brought Fenton refuses to use the axe and flees running to tell the sheriff what is happening. The sheriff pretends to agree to check then brings Fenton home to Dad. The sheriff and Dad scoff at the story but Fenton insists despite Dad's warning glances. Fenton brings the sheriff to the dungeon ... and Dad kills him. Then Dad vomits and cries that Fenton has made him a murderer because he wasn't supposed to tell. Fenton says Dad is already a murderer but Dad insists his other victims weren't people and had to be destroyed.As punishment Dad locks Fenton in the cellar until he is in contact with God. After the first week Fenton tells Dad there is no God. As his confinement continues he begins to hallucinate. When he becomes unresponsive they bring him out and Fenton smiles and tells his father that he has seen God and understands his purpose now.Fenton is serene and confident as they go to the home of their next victim a nasty man who is abusive towards his wife. They knock him out and bring him home. Dad performs the bare-handed touch ritual and nods to Fenton to destroy this demon using the axe. Fenton raises it in the air .... and swings the axe sideways into Dad. Dad falls backwards across the room the axe blade in his chest. Shocked emotions race across his face. Adam runs to him and Dad whispers in Adam's ear before he dies. Fenton turns to the prisoner on the floor and rips the tape from his mouth. The man cries out in warning as Adam runs towards them and swings the axe completing Dad's intention.Fenton and Adam are burying their father and the demon in the rose garden. Fenton asks Adam to promise that ""when you destroy me you'll bury me here"". Adam vows to do so.Agent Doyle expresses confusion - why did Adam promise Fenton to bury him there when it is Fenton that has confessed to keeping a promise by burying Adam in the rose garden? The man known to us as Fenton Meiks reveals that he has concealed his identity that he is actually Adam and has buried his brother Fenton that night. Doyle suddenly realises he has put himself in danger alone in a garden of graves with a killer. They struggle - and Doyle is knocked to the ground wounded. As Adam touches him horrible visions flash past - Agent Doyle killing his own mother with blood spattering everywhere Dad's first female victim lying in bed with a man whose throat is cut the older man luring a little girl with candy then pulling her lifeless body from his car ... The last vision is of the real Fenton's death at his brother Adam's hands. There is no struggle they both have accepted the inevitable. Back in the present Adam swings the family axe then digs a new grave.At the FBI building the next day those seeking the missing Agent Doyle are surprised to find that all of the security camera footage of ""Fenton"" is scrambled and distorted so that his face cannot be seen. They travel to the real Fenton Meiks' house and find his body along with a list of his victims. The last name on the list is Wesley Doyle.One agent is sent to the small town sheriff's office that received Doyle's call at the beginning of the Meiks' interview. The secretary summons the sheriff - a neatly uniformed Adam Meiks. As he leaves he tells Adam they wanted him to know about his brother before word got out to the press. Adam shakes his hand firmly then holds on a bit longer to the agent's confusion. Adam nods and says ""You're a good man."" The secretary walks out and stands behind Adam saying ""Praise God."""

FBI agent Wesley Doyle is startled by the declaration of youngster Fenton Meiks about how his father's delusions required him and his brother Adam to become his 'demon-slaying' murder accomplices.

Fenton Meeks comes forth to tell the FBI that his brother Adam may be the serial killer who calls himself God's Hands who the FBI has been searching for. The film uses flashbacks to show Meeks' childhood with a father who believed he was on a mission from God to destroy demons that inhabit human bodies. Fenton saw his dad as evil while Adam saw him as a hero.::Anonymous

Dwight Bradley Masen is a well respected lawyer from a long line of lawyers he who sees the guiding principles of the law and justice as hallmarks by which he lives. His son Bob Masen will follow in Brad's footsteps Bob who will soon be graduating from law school. It's because of Brad's stance on his profession that Andy Layford Chair of the Citizens' Commission on Crime asks him to sit on the commission. It is also that stance that leads to a lawyer acquaintance Wayne Kellwin asking Brad to take over one of his criminal cases basically pro bono. The penniless client twenty-six year old Rudi Wallchek is charged with murdering nineteen year old Johnny Hulderman the son of locksmith Peter Hulderman late one evening in the Hulderman family business storefront. The request is basically a Hail Mary move on Kellwin's part as Kellwin will probably lose the case based on evidence and as Brad has no criminal trial experience with Kellwin believing Rudi not guilty and wanting the jury to believe the same based on principled Brad being the defense lawyer. After speaking to Rudi Brad accepts the case also believing Rudi to be innocent. Despite the evidence Brad is able to get a not guilty verdict from the jury. After the trial Brad comes into some information which points to Rudi truly being the murderer and that the murder itself was part of a larger extortion scheme where Rudi was probably only the collections man for whoever the head of the scheme. As Rudi cannot be retried for a charge for which he has already been acquitted Brad has to decide how far he will go in and out of the court to ensure that justice is done against Rudi and for Rudi's boss and if he himself is above the law if he does choose a path that is against the law.::Huggo
