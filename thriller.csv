"A comfortably wealthy lawyer and his trophy wife speed through the rain in their Mercedes, intent on getting to the ferry on time to make their planned dinner date, bickering pointlessly over their lateness and the risky driving. Suddenly they spot a person collapsing by the side of the road and reluctantly pull over. The person turns out to be a young drifter who, when roused, resists all suggestions that the police be called or that he see a doctor or visit a hospital. Giving the young man a ride, they reach the ferry dock too late, and take a room for the night, while the young man goes on his way with a handout of cash from the sympathetic wife, despite the cynicism of the husband. The wife begins to seduce her husband, but he is distracted by having forgotten the food at the dock, and she gives up.The next day they catch the ferry, oblivious to the fact that the young man is also aboard. They then navigate their runabout to the wife's inherited vacation home, where their pastoral lunch seems marred by an underlying tension. Venturing out in their sailboat, they encounter a fog bank and run aground on Seal Rock. The wife is surprised by the same young man, who the husband knocks unconscious with a tree limb mistakenly believing she is in danger. When the boy comes to, he explains how he was carried off by the ferry while asleep, and happened to run aground on the island when trying to return on a boat he ""borrowed"". With his help, the couple get their sailboat unstranded and return to the vacation house with the young man where they warm up by the fire and, exhausted, go to sleep. The wife awakes in the night and goes to speak with the drifter on the couch near the fire; he acts on the sexual tension between them and, although she rejects his advances, the husband appears wielding an axe; at which point the wife awakens, still in bed with her husband.The next day the couple awake to discover that the drifter has made them a magnificent breakfast, in gratitude. As they eat, the wife happily reminisces about her romantic youth as a student at Yale; when the boy asks for a ride back to the ferry terminal in the runabout, the husband comes out of his funk to demand jovially that the boy stay for a dinner prepared by the husband, the wife to judge whether it or the boy's breakfast was the better meal. The three lounge around for a morning which is both relaxing and tense; when the husband goes off to play golf, the wife awakens the boy napping in the boathouse, and the two engage in aimlessly childish play before the wife takes him into the woods to pick wild mushrooms, on which she was schooled by her father before he committed suicide. She demonstrates to the young man the subtle difference between two similar mushrooms; the deadly amanita rubenica and the amanita muscaria, an aphrodisiac. In reality this time, the boy acts on the sexual attraction between them, using his sleight of hand skills to tease her with the amanita muscaria, but is rebuffed by the wife.The husband returns home feeling ill, but rouses himself to set up the promised dinner, then take the boy back to the ferry; however the powerboat engine dies and they return to the house. The next day, the longstanding tensions between the couple and the new rivalry between the two men over the wife finally erupt into an argument between the couple, which suddenly turns into the husband chasing the drifter out of the house into the woods. After he abandons the chase, the wife finds the drifter and finally succumbs to his advances, as he continues yesterday's seduction by teasing her with the amanita muscaria mushroom in an erotic fashion.The scene abruptly shifts to the burial of the wife, as the reverend says she committed suicide for unknown reasons. The husband returns to the vacation home, where he meets the young man again; and it becomes clear that the two are lovers who have apparently done away with the wife, presumably by the boy using his prestidigitation to feed her the deadly amanita rubenica instead of the aphrodisiac species."

"A bit of history: Like many teens in the 1980s, Viktoria [Marisa Ryan] was
interested in the occult. Unlike most teens, Viktoria met up with a
vampire who was willing to give her what she wanted. Her boyfriend Jake,
however, was turned at the same time as Viktoria and couldn't live with
it, so he fried himself in the sun. Viktoria maintains herself on blood
purchased from a bloodbank employee who runs a blackmarket on the side.
Viktoria also lives with the guilt of helplessly watching her mother die
(in a road accident). Consequently, these experiences have turned
Viktoria's heart cold in that she avoids emotional involvement.So here it is, some eight years later, and Viktoria is on the
boardwalk with her friends Alicia [Amy Jo Johnson] and Darius [Jon Huertas] when they are suddenly
confronted by Chas [Christopher Wiehl], Viktoria's ex and one of those bad*ss vampires. Chas
is still P.O.ed at Viktoria and coldcocks her right then and there. From
the background comes a voice, ""Watch your back, Chuck."" Turns out that the
voice belongs to a new guy named Seth [Robert Floyd] who happens upon Viktoria the next
night as she walks along the beach. Seth is from Philadelphia, but he is
vacationing with four of his fraternity brothers -- Kevin, Scott, Kinka,
and Danny. Seth does not shirk from confrontation with Chas and his
""horsemen"" -- R.P., John Luke, Duncan, and Connor -- like everyone else in
town and seems to have taken on the job of acting as Viktoria's Sir
Lancelot.At the moment, however, Viktoria has other problems. Alicia is
anorexic, and Viktoria has to take her some medicine. Alicia's medicine
turns out to be a vial of blood. Only recently turned (by R.P.), Alicia
hates being a vampire and refuses to feed. Drinking the blood from the
vial makes her feel even worse, so Viktoria slits her own wrist and lets
Alicia drink from her arm. Meanwhile, Seth is hoping to meet up again with
Viktoria. Remembering that she mentioned working at a sunglasses store, he
stops at the only sunglasses shop on the boardwalk and asks for her. The
salesgirl doesn't know of any Viki that works there, but Chas overhears
Seth's question and confronts him. After exchanging insults, Chas invites
Seth to join his group, and they go off together to smoke some dope. The
insults keep flying until Connor challenges Seth, but Seth effortlessly
gives Connor a wedgie and kicks him to the ground. [Hmmmm, is there
something fishy about Seth?]The next night, Seth runs into Viktoria, Alicia, and Darius on the
boardwalk, and Alicia and Darius get lost so that Viktoria and Seth can be
together. While Seth and Viktoria walk along the beach, Chas runs into
Darius and Alicia. Chas mesmerizes Darius into going home and then
mesmerizes Alicia into joining him and his horsemen. Chas takes Alicia on
a killing spree. When Alicia finds out what Chas has made her do, she is
distraught. The next day, she sits in the sun. Viktoria finds Alicia
frying to a crisp, and she disintegrates right before Viktoria's eyes.
That evening, Viktoria and Darius scatter Alicia's dust into the ocean.After a pep talk from Uncle Joe, in which he advises Viktoria that
the best way to keep from getting a cold heart is to ""keep it warm"",
Viktoria pays a visit to Seth. After sharing a glass of wine, the two end
up talking openly to each other. Viktoria tells Seth that Alicia is dead,
and Seth tells Viktoria about his girlfriend Sarah and how she was
attacked and killed by a ""huge grey shape"" while they were hiking together
in the Appalachians. The next day, as Seth is watching the sun go down
along the beach, John Luke catches up with him and warns him that Chas is
looking to kill him. A bit later that evening, just after Seth and
Viktoria run into each other on the boardwalk, Chas and his horsemen come
looking for Seth. Chas challenges Seth to a fight and shows his fangs.
Seth agrees to the fight but not before changing into a werewolf. They
tear at each other for a while. Just as it looks like Chas has gotten the
upper hand, Viktoria rips out his heart. As Chas disintegrates, she looks
around for Seth, but he has disappeared.The next day, Viktoria puts on her sunglasses and goes looking for
Seth. His friends are packing up their car to leave town, and they tell
her that Seth has already left. Viktoria goes home, only to find Seth
sitting on her porch. They thank each other for being there, and they kiss.

These events have made him an angry man, manifested by a temper which he is no longer ashamed to display in public. When he's already down, his life gets arguably as worse as it can when evidence arises pointing him to being a serial murderer, the so-called ""Necktie Murders"", which are characterized by the young female victims being raped before they are strangled to death by a necktie, which the murderer leaves tied around the victim. The lead investigator for New Scotland Yard is Chief Inspector Oxford, who has no other suspects before Richard comes to his attention following the discovery of the latest victim. Richard, who knows the police are after him, needs to elude them. He has to decide who to trust, him making a mistake in this realm which could make his situation worse, or worse yet, get him killed at the hands of the true murderer.::Huggo"

"The film, An Ordinary Killer reflects the ultimate success story in the intriguing world of forensic investigation. This amazing movie captures the early beginnings of two important investigative techniques that are routinely used in today's criminal investigations, those being the scientific process of DNA technology and the behavioral approach of criminal psychological profiling. At the time of the murder of a young woman in 1973 in a Michigan community, DNA technology and psychological profiling were unheard of by most criminal investigators. At that time I was serving as a criminologist in the FBI's newly organized Behavioral Science Unit and attempting to convince the law enforcement community that criminal profiling could be useful in a murder investigation and was not akin to voodoo. It seems a detective in Michigan working a murder investigation of a young woman got my message and was inspired and motivated. Above all, An Ordinary Killer captures the basic qualities of investigative tenacity that separate those cases that go unsolved to the success story depicted in this compelling drama that spanned several decades. Tony Hornus has produced an important incentive to the law enforcement field to never give up on a crime of violence and to try new forensic techniques. He has also produced an important educational message to the general public concerning the tedious work that goes on in a murder investigation. But most importantly, Tony Hornus has issued a warning to the dark side of society, that being, ""If you commit a crime of violence, you will be caught, no matter how long it takes to catch you.""::Col.

"Jack Elgin is the European editor of The Economist, which is based in London, England. Jack has a wife named Maria and three kids named Joanne, Julia, and Andrew. Jack subtly changes the family vacation from a lazy week of Mediterranean fun and sun in Corfu, Greece, to a tour of India, because of a story he has to cover. Maria is not as impressed by this as the kids are. Jack himself envisioned a chance to simultaneously work an easy reporting assignment and spend a little quality time with his family. But on the way to India, the airplane, a 747 owned by AM Air, an American airline, makes an unscheduled stopover in Limassol Cyprus, because of a mechanical problem. After a while of waiting inside the Limassol airport, everyone gets back on the plane -- which is then hijacked by a group of terrorists known as the August 15th Movement, led by a Serbian man named Ivanic Loyvek and his right-hand man Karadan Maldic. The terrorists take a silver briefcase from an diplomatic courier, an older man, and it appears to be an important object of their hijack. And they are demanding $50,000,000 from the US State Department in one hour, or everyone on the airplane will die.The demand is met, and Loyvek and Maldic start releasing the women and children, with the men to go last. But as soon as a front passenger door is opened, the local police begins shooting. Inside the plane, the owner of the briefcase retrieves it, only to be killed the terrorists, who take it again.The flight attendants frantically open the rest of the airplane's doors and start getting passengers out, but the terrorists start killing passengers, leading to an explosion. Maria, Joanne, and Julia get out of the airplane, and then Jack, holding Andrew, gets out -- only to watch Maria, Joanne, and Julia get shot by the terrorists. Jack tries to hide Andrew's face so he can't see. Maria and Joanne are killed, but Julia burns to death while crying for help.Jack and Andrew survive. 15 passengers die, and Loyvek and Maldic, the surviving terrorists, escape, knowing that they now have the $50,000,000. Back in London, a devastated Jack is told that the terrorists were captured, but they were released and deported secretly, with no charges and no arrest, the result of some awfully compromised politics. Jack is understandably enraged that Loyvek and Maldic got off scot-free. While helping Andrew cope, Jack tries all the legal ways to ensure justice for his family, but to no avail.Jack even pays a visit to Henry Davidson, a CIA agent who works at the American Embassy in London. Davidson tells Jack that there's little that can be done. The American and British governments are completely impotent when it comes to going after Loyvek and Maldic. Jack decides he has no choice in the matter but to seek revenge. With the help of his ex-intelligence operative friend Kate Stockton, who is well-schooled in the finer points of international intelligence, Jack becomes a one-man anti-terrorist squadron, searching for Loyvek and Maldich. He finds a warehouse they apparently are using as a headquarters. Breaking in, he finds some papers which he takes, and some weapons. The terrorists return, find a flashlight Jack was using, and begin searching the warehouse. Jack returns upstairs, retrieves a machine pistol and loads it with a magazine. He kills three terrorists before escaping.He later breaks into the home of a friend at MI6 and steals a Walther PPK pistol from his home. He shows up at a theatre and makes a scene at the bar, to be sure he is noticed by the bartender. He then follows one of the terrorists in his taxicab, killing him with that weapon. He returns to the theatre and makes a point of apologizing to the bartender. The next day he goes pheasant hunting with his MI6 contact in case he is tested for gunpowder residue.Dogging Jack's trail is FBI agent Jules Bernard, who's cooperating with Scotland Yard on anti-terrorist activities, and who suspects that Jack is the man who has been killing anyone involved in the hijacking. Jules tries to persuade Jack that he is on his side, and he's willing to help Jack make those responsible pay for the deaths of his family and the other people who died in Cyprus.Bernard reveals that CIA agent Davidson who had been ""assisting"" Jack was behind the hijacking and has set Jack on a course to eliminate the terrorists so Davidson can keep the money for himself. The ""August 15"" name of the hijacking was a cover for purely financial motives. He tells Jack that he is now Davidson's target, and tells him into he has no choice but to help Bernard with bringing Davidson to justice.Bernard tells Jack that Davidson intends to have him killed on a train bound for Paris where Jack is to cover a meeting of government ministers. Bernard accompanies him carrying a duffel bag full of grenades and automatic weapons. When Davidson's men attack Jack, Bernard and Jack shoot back, killing three attackers, including one of the hijackers.In Paris, Davidson hijacks Jack and his driver, telling Jack the Bernard didn't have a warrant and all of the evidence he gathered is inadmissible. Jack swears at the driver, telling him he only needed 12 seconds to finish this. He jumps from the car, as does the driver. Davidson leans forward to grab the wheel and sees a grenade on the floor. The grenade explodes, destroying the car and killing Davidson. Jack, his son, and Jack's friend Stockton depart on a sail boat, leaving behind Jack's workaholic life, his revenge complete."
