A documentary on the impact of globalization on the world's different wine regions.::Anonymous
"Explores a thesis: that the deep colored, oak-aged taste of Bordeaux wines has become the world standard, following the writing of critic Robert Parker, the magazine ""Wine Spectator,"" the consulting work of Michel Rolland of Pomerol, and the money of Mondavi, a publicly-traded corporation based in Napa with a family history of wine making. Wine makers worldwide, many using Rolland as a consultant, pursue this structure, color, and taste - to the detriment, argue some, of wine that should reflect the character of the land where the grape is grown, including the lighter Burgundy. A few old wine makers, from Aniane, Sardinia, and Argentina offer this argument.::<jhailey@hotmail.com>"

"A compendium of interviews and excerpts from the films of the late sixties and early 70s that were a counter movement to the big Studio Films of the late sixties. Directed by Ted Demme, it is obviously a labor of love of the films of the period, but it gives short shrift to the masterpieces of the times.Many of the filmmakers of this period were influenced by Truffaut, Antonioni, Fellini, Bergman, and of course John Cassavetes. Unfortunately the documentary logging in at 138 minutes is too short!The film is rich with interviews and opinions of filmmakers. Some of the people interviewed are: Martin Scorsese, Francis Coppola, Robert Altman, Peter Bogdonovich, Ellen Burstyn, and Roger Corman, Bruce Dern, Sydney Pollack, Dennis Hopper, and Jon Voight.Bruce Dern has a moment of truth when he says that he and Jack Nicholson may not have been as good looking as the other stars that came before them but they were ""interesting"". This summarizes the other areas of this period of filmmaking in American history.The filmmakers were dealing with a lack of funding from the Studios because they were expressing unconventional attitudes about politics, sex, drugs, gender and race issues, and Americas involvement in overseas conflicts like the Vietnam War.An interview with Francis Coppola is enlightening with his saying that he got the chance to make The Conversation because the producers knew he had been trained by Roger Corman to make a movie with nothing so they bankrolled his film.Another interview is with Jon Voight who was directed by Hal Ashby in Coming Home a clear anti-war film about a crippled soldier immersing himself back into society after his facing battle. Voight talks about how his working methods helped him achieve an emotional telling point when Ashby said that they were doing a rehearsal take and it ended up being the take used in the film- it was better because it was so un-rehearsed and not drained of its freshness by being over-rehearsed.There are also many fine excerpts from Al Pacino's break-through film The Panic in Needle Park, and interviews from Dennis Hopper on the making of Easy Rider, and interviews from Sydney Pollack about making films.The documentary is a jumping off point for any film lover who wants to see examples of what the new voices in film were like in the Seventies. Many of the Sundance Folks, where this film made a big splash, are unaware of just how much the Independent Film Maker today owes to the films of John Cassavetes, Milos Foreman, William Friedkin, and Roger Corman."
A documentary examining the decade of the 1970s as a turning point in American cinema. Some of today's best filmmakers interview the influential directors of that time.::Anonymous
"The 1970s was an extraordinary time of rebellion, of questioning every accepted idea: political activism, hedonism, protests, the sexual revolution, the women's movement, the civil rights movement, the music revolution, rage and liberation. Every standard by which we set our social and cultural clocks was either turned inside out or thrown away completely and reinvented. For American cinema, the 1970s was an era during which a new generation of filmmakers created work for a new kind of audience--moviegoers who were hungry for stories that reflected their own experiences and who were turning their backs on aged old studio formulas. As a result, emerging filmmakers influenced by foreign directors such as Godard, Kurosawa and Fellini coupled with the social climate and a struggling studio system, converged to create a new kind of moviemaking. Through their choice of material, filmmakers such as Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, Robert Altman, Peter Bogdanovich, William Friedkin, Roger Corman and Paul Schrader revolutionized mainstream movies and for the first time personal visions were coming out of the studio system.::Sujit R.

"The modern suburbs have ultimately become an unsustainable way of living. They were originally developed in an era of cheap oil, when the automobile became the center of the way people lived and an era when people wanted to escape the inner city to a more pastoral or rural way of life. However the suburbs quickly evolved into a merely a place to live that had neither the benefits of rural or urban life, and where one was reliant on an automobile both to travel elsewhere and even travel within the neighborhood. The suburbs are not only dependent upon cheap energy, but also reliable energy. The reliability of energy is becoming less so as demonstrated by the multi-day blackout of the North American Eastern Seaboard starting on August 14, 2003. Part of the problem of getting out of the suburban mentality is that a generation has grown up believing it to be a normal way of life, and a life of entitlement, which they will not give up without a fight. But many developers and planners and some of the general public understand the want and need to make the way the collective we live in a more walkable and humanistic manner.::Huggo"
"Since World War II North Americans have invested much of their newfound wealth in suburbia. It has promised a sense of space, affordability, family life and upward mobility. As the population of suburban sprawl has exploded in the past 50 years, so too the suburban way of life has become embedded in the American consciousness. Suburbia, and all it promises, has become the American Dream. But as we enter the 21st century, serious questions are beginning to emerge about the sustainability of this way of life. With brutal honesty and a touch of irony, The End of Suburbia explores the American Way of Life and its prospects as the planet approaches a critical era, as global demand for fossil fuels begins to outstrip supply. World Oil Peak and the inevitable decline of fossil fuels are upon us now, some scientists and policy makers argue in this documentary. The consequences of inaction in the face of this global crisis are enormous. What does Oil Peak mean for North America? As energy prices skyrocket in the coming years, how will the populations of suburbia react to the collapse of their dream? Are today's suburbs destined to become the slums of tomorrow? And what can be done NOW, individually and collectively, to avoid The End of Suburbia?::sciphex"

"Directors Stephen Spielberg, George Lucas, Ridley Scott and James Cameron discuss the science fiction movies of the 1950s that influenced them.::David Glagovsky@prodigy.net"
"'Stephen Spielberg', Ridley Scott, James Cameron and George Lucas discuss the importance of science fiction films and the influence of the genre. Following the end of World War II, new kinds of enemies appeared, those that could not be seen such as the atom or the fear of the unknown such as that resulting from the cold war. Movies became metaphors for those fears and science fiction films took many forms. They include giant bugs such as the ants in Them! (1954) or inanimate object such as in The Monolith Monsters (1957). In The Incredible Shrinking Man (1957) the terror comes from everyday life - a cat, a spider - as the man gets smaller and smaller. Science fiction involving space travel required more imagination. Destination Moon (1950) and Rocketship X-M (1950) were early attempts at taking a serious look at space flight and its implications. Then there were encounters with aliens, some benign, such as Klaatu from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) or aggressive aliens as terrorist or a danger to humankind such as in Invaders from Mars (1953) or The War of the Worlds (1953).::garykmcd"

In retrospect, Jim and Tammy seem more worthy of respect than their con-man contemporaries from the 1970s/1980s and also the current crop of born-again crazies. They pulled off some outrageous stuff, and were over the edge in many respects, but I don't believe they actually willfully tried to swindle people and such.

"One hundred fifty digital video cameras are distributed to everyday Iraqis, they encouraged to record their feelings about their life. They are also encouraged to pass the cameras along to get as many Iraqis across the country to participate in this project as possible. The cameras are in circulation from April to September 2004, shortly after the American bombing of Fallujah and the fall of the dictatorial regime of Saddam Hussein, the resulting footage which is compiled as this movie. Most of the subjects talk about issues around Hussein versus the Americans, and whether their lives and of Iraqis in general are better off now or then, their thoughts about democracy in general and how it applies to Iraq, and what they want to see for their future. A few also steer clear of politics altogether, they wanting to focus on happier things in their life. As the cameras move around the country, regional differences emerge, such as the Kurds of the north, who were persecuted by Hussein, having a unique perspective. Differences also emerge based on individual exposure to Hussein and/or his associates, or to what recently occurred in Fallujah. This digital camera footage is interspersed with other videos, including propaganda video by jihadis, and found unofficial videos recorded by Hussein's regime documenting their actions while in power, and with western media headlines about the Iraqi situation which has largely shaped the western view of life in Iraq.::Huggo"

"Welles' take on filmmaking is as a form of trickery and fakery by editing different parts of other documentary footage on a famous forger Elmyr de Hory, being interviewed by the famous biographer of Howard Hughes, Clifford Irving. De Hory claimed that he never painted a picture by a famous artist, that he offered to a museum, that they didn't buy, and Irving was advanced $800,000 thousand dollars for an autobiography of the reclusive Howard Hughes which was completely false. Welles begins F for Fake by performing several magic tricks and claiming that filmmaking is prestidigitation and tricks the viewer into seeing something that the viewer willfully accepts. The filmmaker cites his own rise to stardom as a trickster by claiming that his first entrance on the scene was with a fake radio program about invasion from Mars. As the film follows De Hory and his development as a forger, it also follows Clifford Irving as a close associate of De Hory as evidence of how Orson Welles' formula for stardom reads, regardless of what the artist does with his art."
A documentary about fraud and fakery.::Robbie Smith <robsmith@u.washington.edu>
"Orson Welles' free-form documentary about fakery focusses on the notorious art forger Elmyr de Hory and Elmyr's biographer, Clifford Irving, who also wrote the celebrated fraudulent Howard Hughes autobiography, then touches on the reclusive Hughes and Welles' own career (which started with a faked resume and a phony Martian invasion). On the way, Welles plays a few tricks of his own on the audience.::Anonymous"
"Famed director Orson Welles hosts and narrates this film dealing essentially with the question of what is real - and what is not. Trickery, he suggests, is found everywhere in life. On the island of Ibiza, Welles encounters author Clifford Irving, who became famous for his fake biography of Howard Hughes and Elmyr de Hory, reputedly one of the 20th century's great art forgers. Welles is his intriguing self as he discusses the role of so-called experts and ends the film with his own version of an illusion. Welles' final film.::garykmcd"
"Filmmaker Orson Welles discusses the issue of fakes purporting to be reality. He describes the range of fakes in life, which can be as relatively benign as his demonstration of having a beautiful seductively dressed woman walk down the street, her purpose, which most looking in from the outside would believe to get from point A to point B, but is in reality Welles' want to gage the reaction of primarily men to her by secretly filming them. He also discloses his own history with the issue, from his fascination with magic, to lying to get jobs, to the hoax that was his infamous radio program War of the Worlds. He focuses on three individual but somewhat interrelated and high profile cases. The first two involve Elmyr de Hory and Clifford Irving, the latter the former's biographer. Elmyr eventually came out as probably the most prolific art forger in the world. While Elmyr goes through his process, Irving muses on Elmyr's rationale in his work, his own reason for wanting to tell Elmyr's story, and how fake the biography is in light of Elmyr not being totally forthright in his own history. In Irving's own story, he is now most renowned as the hoaxster who purported to write Howard Hughes' authorized memoir. It eventually came to light that Hughes had no involvement with the project at all. The third case, which brought about more than one issue of fraud, centers on artist Pablo Picasso's fascination with a beautiful young woman he saw continually walking the streets of his hometown of Toussaint. In the presentation of these many situations, Welles brings up the philosophical question: if the fake is not discovered, is it real?::Huggo"

"Overhaulin' was an American automotive reality television series that ran for five seasons between 2004 and 2008 on TLC. Then had a four-year hiatus, returning the sixth season on October 2, 2012 on Velocity and Discovery with the final episode airing November 2015. Nine total seasons.The show's hosts varied slightly with the most consistent were automobile designer Chip Foose and his co-host Chris Jacobs. Courtney Hansen was the co-host of the show until 2005, when she left the show to pursue other interests. She was replaced by the shows Executive Producer Brutsman's wife Adrienne Janic (""AJ""). Then Season 6 , Jessi Combs, one of the early A-Team mechanics, returned and co-hosted as well as participated in the the actual projects. Then Combs moved on to All Girls Garage, where Combs left soon after there as well. Arianny Celeste replaced Combs.The show started out with a fun premise where they Overhaulin Staff would seek out an unknowing ""victim"" - that they called the mark. The ""Mark,"" is one selected of literally thousands of applications/submissions nominated to be ""Overhauled"" by his or her family or friends, they call them the ""Insiders"". The Marks's car, usually an old in need of restoration classic car, is obtained through some ruse. In example the car being ""stolen"" by Chris and Chip, a car being misplaced or lost at a mechanic's shop, or the car being towed away by ""police."" In the beginning and for most of the shows run the Host and co-host play tricks on the unsuspecting mark, sometimes acting in roles of insurance adjusters or law enforcement agents, other times helping the insider, while Chip Foose and a team of mechanics - dubbed ""The A-Team"" have taken the vehicle to Chip Fooses Southern California restoration garage and partner facilities. They then with a staff of up to 60 master automotive repair engineers restore the car to better than-new custom condition in about 8 days. Each show ends with the surprise reuniting of owner and newly made-over car who in the early episodes of the show actually felt he or she had lost their car.Later seasons and last shows went with a much simpler procedure and without the unknowing victim just went to the producers deemed worthy candidates and let them know they had been selected for an Overhaulin of there favorite car. This made the program more accessible within the over structure of the show and the quick turn around and delivery of a restored vehicle to its owner. Typical cost to do this kind of a quick transformation would be north of $150,000 per vehicle, an absolutely free no charge restoration for the ""Mark.""The show was a pioneer in thought, idea and implementation of TV Automotive reality shows. The late Boyd Coddington had an unknown influence where he was a real early TV reality show with his shop activities. Chip Foose had actually been employed by him there before his break away and his own reality show. The quality of Chip Foose as a designer, illustrator, restoration and unique creations expert has earned him an impressive portfolio of automotive works that is difficult to rival. Few automotive shops have the professionalism, quality of work and completion rate of his talents. Although Overhaulin is now a past Reality TV show Chip Foose can still be seen in many other venues. Whether SEMA in Las Vegas or numerous guest appearances at other notable events by this reality likable TV star. Overhaulin is an important foot note in the history of the now very crowed and popular television Automotive reality shows seen on many channels, History, Discovery and Motor Trend to name a few. - Martin Snytsheuvel"

"Based on the best-selling book of the same name by Fortune reporters Bethany McLean and Peter Elkind, a multidimensional study of one of the biggest business scandals in American history. The chronicle takes a look at one of the greatest corporate disasters in history, in which top executives from the 7th largest company in this country walked away with over one billion dollars, leaving investors and employees with nothing. The film features insider accounts and rare corporate audio and video tapes that reveal colossal personal excesses of the Enron hierarchy and the utter moral vacuum that posed as corporate philosophy. The human drama that unfolds within Enron's walls resembles a Greek tragedy and produces a domino effect that could shape the face of our economy and ethical code for years to come.::Sujit R.

"Was Jesus Christ a teacher and a prophet, the son of God, or did he ever exist at all? A cloth Jesus was believed to have worn at his burial, known as the Holy Shroud, was exhibited on August 27, 1978 in Turin, Italy. When the cloth was photographed, the face of a man believed to be Christ appeared. Is the shroud authentic proof that Jesus rose from the dead? Several scholars and scientists from around the world are interviewed about stories from the Bible, contending that discoveries such as the Dead Sea Scrolls dating between 168 B.C. and 233 A.D., corroborated most of the stories from the Old Testament.Prophesies 800 years before the birth of Christ foretold of a prophet born in Bethlehem and raised in Galilee, who would become known for miracles and healing, but who would eventually be condemned to death. Is there proof that this Messiah was Jesus Christ?After speculating about what happened during Jesus' ""missing years,"" from age 12 when Jesus learned about his origins as the Son of God and briefly ran away from his parents to the Nazareth synagogue, to age 30 when the adult Jesus (John Rubenstein) was working as a carpenter's apprentice in which God ordered Jesus in a dream to return to the Nazareth synagogue to preach about God's new teachings. There, Jesus began his ministry after being baptized by John the Baptist (Michael Ruud). After Jesus' baptism in the Jordan River, John the Baptist sent Andrew (Stanley Kamel) and Peter (Anthony De Longis) to join him in his mission. Over the next three years, Jesus and his 12 followers (Simon, Andrew, James, John, Philip, Thaddeus, Bartholomew, Thomas, James, Matthew, Mark and Judas) traveled all over Galilee and the surrounding areas, comforted the grief-stricken, restored sight to the blind, healed the sick, and raised the dead. He grew in popularity as he preached peace and faith as the foundation of miracles. Soon Jesus's disciples witnessed his power over Earth's elements.When King Herod Antipas (Nehemiah Persoff), the son of the late King Herod the Great, heard stories of Jesus' abilities, he was threatened and left it to Caiaphas (John Anderson), a Jewish priest, to decide Jesus's fate. Meanwhile, Judas (Dennis Saylor), one of Jesus' disciples, urged Jesus to journey to Jerusalem, arriving on Palm Sunday, where people expected that Jesus would free them from Roman rule. When Jesus saw the city's temple converted into a marketplace with gambling, he went on an angry rampage, overturning the vendor and gambling tables, driving the merchants out of the temple and openly accused the Hebrew priests of being hypocritical and corrupt. Jesus's actions disappointed his followers and many rejected him as the Messiah. His diminishing influence left him vulnerable to attack by his enemies.Later that week at the Passover Seder (known as the 'Last Supper') at around midnight on Friday later that week, the mood was grim because the Apostles realized they did not know which man was bribed to betray Jesus. When Judas left the dinner, Jesus told him to carry out his plan swiftly. Later that night, Judas lead Roman soldiers to find Jesus and they separated him from his Apostles. At dawn, the Jewish priests wanted Roman judge and governor Pontius Pilate (Lawrence Dobkin) to hand down the death sentence because Jesus was a criminal, who called himself the Messiah and encouraged the public to stop paying taxes to the Roman Emperor Tiberius. Pontius replied that he could observe the Passover custom of releasing a criminal or he could release Jesus. Caiaphas ordered critics of Jesus to fill the town square and they condemned him.On the way to Jesus's crucifixion, Roman soldiers made him wear a crown of thorns, whipped him, and later, nailed him to a crucifix. Caiaphas taunted him about being the son of God. When Jesus asked God why he has been forsaken, God assured him that all would be well. Jesus then asked that his spirit be delivered into God's hands.At sundown, Joseph of Arimathea (Walter Brooke) transported Christ's body to a cave, where it was prepared with oils and spices and wrapped in a cloth. Three days later, Jesus magically appeared to all his disciples except Thomas. When Thomas did not believe the miracle, Jesus returned to all the disciples eight days later before both his physical body and soul ascended into Heaven. His surviving 11 disciples were left behind to spread the word about Jesus Christ's death and resurrection.The Book of Mormon tells of Jesus visiting Native Americans, whom Mormons believe are descended from the lost tribes of Israel. Is this evidence that Jesus visited the New World after his resurrection? There are also accounts from the U.S. and Mexico that document the appearance of a bearded white man many years before Caucasians were seen in the area.In 1898 Turin, Italy, an amateur photographer developed a negative of the Holy Shroud when church fathers asked him to take photographs of the cloth. The results were a positive image instead of a negative. Tracing the shroud's history, it is said that in 30 A.D. Odessa, Turkey, a burial shroud with Christ's image was discovered. To safeguard it from destruction, the item was hidden in a wall until a flood in 525 A.D. dislodged it and workers took the relic to Constantinople. Over the centuries, the shroud traveled many miles until it was moved to Turin in 1578, where it remained in a special shrine.In present day Turin, a chemist reports that a group of scientists studied the cloth in 1978 to discover that the markings did not occur from liquids seeping into the material, but as a result of scorching.British author and journalist Geoffrey Ashe adds that the phenomena of Christ's resurrection could have let off a burst of radiation that affected the cloth. To authenticate the shroud, Scotland Yard's Professor James Cameron, a forensic pathologist, did an analysis of the cloth that determined the wounds from the crown of thorns are visible, and abrasions are visible from the left side of the body where the victim would have fallen after being beaten. Additionally, wounds appeared that were consistent with the wrists and feet from being nailed to the cross. The professor says it would have been hard to forge the cloth with the known technology at the time it was discovered and the wounds represent those Jesus received at the time of his crucifixion. In addition to the forensic analysis, other scientists created a three-dimensional scan that many believe resembles recognizable images of Jesus. As science progresses, the shroud may reveal new information.In the meantime, the essence of Jesus Christ, the man himself, and his teachings can never be forgotten."

"Director Warner Herzog uses sequences extracted from more than 100 hours of video footage shot by Timothy Treadwell during the last five years of his life. He also conducts and filmed interviews with Treadwell's family and friends, and bear and nature experts. Park rangers and bear experts commented on statements and actions by Treadwell, such as his repeated claims that he was defending the bears from poachers. Park rangers noted that there had never been a recorded incident of poaching at this national park.As another example, Treadwell claimed he had ""gained the trust"" of certain bears, sufficient to approach and pet them. Park rangers pointed out that bears are wild and potentially dangerous animals; given that, Treadwell was lucky to have survived as long as he had without being mauled. One park ranger suggested that the bears were so confused by Treadwell's direct, casual contact that they weren't sure how to react to him. Other park rangers point out that the bears were not threatened by poachers, but Treadwell's actions put them at real risk of harm and death. By familiarizing them with human contact, he increased the likelihood that they would approach human habitation seeking food, and cause a confrontation in which humans would kill them.In October 2003, Treadwell was camping in Katmai National Park with his girlfriend, Amie Huguenard. Treadwell usually left the park at the end of summer but that year stayed into early October. This put him and Huguenard at greater risk, as in this period, bears are aggressive about searching for food to store up calories for hibernation during the winter. Herzog speculates that their staying later in the season ultimately resulted in the deaths of Treadwell and Huguenard.In addition to presenting views from friends and professionals, Herzog narrates and offers his own interpretations of events. He concluded that Treadwell had a sentimental view of nature, thinking he could tame the wild bears. Herzog notes that nature is cold and harsh. Treadwell's view clouded his thinking and led him to underestimate danger, resulting in his death and that of Huguenard.Treadwell's video camera captured an audio record of the bear attack. Herzog refrained from making this a part of the film, but he is shown listening to it, clearly disturbed. The director advised Jewel Palovak (the owner of the tape) to destroy it rather than listen to it. He later repudiated his own advice, saying it was:""Stupid ... silly advice born out of the immediate shock of hearing-I mean, it's the most terrifying thing I've ever heard in my life. Being shocked like that, I told her, 'You should never listen to it, and you should rather destroy it. It should not be sitting on your shelf in your living room all the time.' But she slept over it and decided to do something much wiser. She did not destroy it but separated herself from the tape, and she put it in a bank vault.""The coroner gave Palovak Treadwell's wristwatch, which had been retrieved from his left arm, one of the few remains found. Willy Fulton, the pilot who discovered the remains of Treadwell and Huguenard, had noted seeing the lone arm with the wristwatch and not being able to keep the image out of his mind."

"Atheist and scientist Richard Dawkins visits England, America and Isreal interveiwing prominant people of faith; Islamic, Hasidic Jews, and the new Christian sects popping up throughout the world, and expressing his view of the extent to which ths fanaticism has degraded our civilisation, and will continue to degrade it. The first part of the documentary is mainly attacking the idea and the obsession behind that idea of 'faith'. He talks about the story of Adam and Eve, which even the Catholic church admits this is metaphorical. So this guys Jesus has himself horribly tortured and murdered in order to save the souls of people who never existed from a sin that was symbolic! Dawkins describes faith as a virus. The second part delves into the lifestyles these extremists bring their children up in, sectorial schools, complete segregation. Children are very sensitive to what they're exposed to and what their elders tell them. In this way, Dawkins theorises, the narrow-mindedness of faith is spread like a virus from generation to generation. Very few of these children are coming out of school with a mind that is open to the world and everything in it. They're coming out with a whole other fantasy world inside their head, one most of us don't understand, and that world, in their mind, rules the real one that they share with us. Dawkins is successful in his subtle way of showing that although creationists think evolutionaries are the narrow minded ones, preaching your own 'faith' is a far more damagingly selfish act, probably the result of grandiose delusions."
"Richard Dawkins' highly critical documentary attacks the pulsing heart of all mainstream religion- faith; with special focus on Islam, Judaism, and Christianity. Contains repeated references to sectorial schools as child abuse and faith as the stepping stone to terrorist activity.::kwedgwood@hotmail.com"

RINGERS explores the real foundations of Middle-earth; a community of true fans who share a common bond. Moving beyond ""cult classic"" and over several different generations, the film unearths countless people gathered under the banner of 'Ringer' -- academics, musicians, movie stars, authors, filmmakers, and a plethora of pop junkies. Celebrity interviewees include Peter Jackson, Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Clive Barker, and David Carradine. RINGERS features a dynamic rock-driven score with musicians who were influenced by J.R.R.

Produced in association with the popular fan-site TheOneRing.net, RINGERS stands as the most comprehensive film document of the ongoing fandom of ""The Lord of the Rings.""

From the Bakshi animated film to Jackson's epic trilogy; this documentary brings together extensive footage collected over 21 months -- across three continents. Our cameras have captured the most energetic ""Lord of the Rings"" events. What began as the private amusement of a tweedy Oxford professor has now become a new mythology for the 21st century.

"Michael Moore is an eccentric, self-taught documentary film director who begins by introducing himself and his family through 8 mm archival home movies; in a voice-over, he describes himself as ""kind of a strange child,"" the Irish American Catholic middle-class son of a General Motors employee assembling AC Spark Plugs. Moore chronicles how GM had previously defined his childhood while growing up in Flint, Michigan, and how the company was the primary economic and social hub of the town. He points out that Flint is the place where the 1937 Flint Sit-Down Strike occurred, resulting in the birth of the United Auto Workers. He reveals that his heroes were the Flint natives who had escaped the life in GM's factories, including the members of Grand Funk Railroad, Casey Kasem, the spouses of Zubin Mehta (Nancy Kovack) and Don Knotts, and ""Flint's most famous native son,"" game show host Bob Eubanks.Initially, he achieves his dream of avoiding the dreary tradition of blue-collared factory life that lays for the majority of the population of Flint; by moving to California and working for a magazine in San Francisco, but this venture fails for him and he ultimately travels back to Flint. As he returns (in 1985), General Motors announces the layoffs of thousands of Flint auto workers, the jobs of whom will go to cheaper labor when the plant relocates to Mexico. GM makes this announcement even though the company is (according to Moore) experiencing record profits.Disguised as a TV journalist from Toledo, Ohio, Moore interviews some auto workers in Flint and discovers their strong antipathy to General Motors chairman Roger B. Smith. Moore begins seeking out Smith himself to confront him with an ""up-close-and-personal"" interview about the closing of the Flint auto factories. He tries to visit Smith at GM's headquarters in Detroit, yet he is blocked by building security guards as Moore hasn't made an appointment. A company spokesman comes to the lobby and exchanges contact information with Moore, initially promising him to discuss an interview with Smith, but due to lack of credentials (since Moore is independent and likewise, does not have a business card), he refuses to grant him one. Over the course of the film, Moore attempts to track down Smith at various places including the Grosse Pointe Yacht Club and the Detroit Athletic Club, only to be told that Smith is not there or to leave by employees and security guards.From here, Moore begins to explore the emotional impact of the plant closings on some of his friends. He interviews an auto worker named Ben Hamper who apparently suffered a nervous breakdown after being laid off on the assembly line and is currently staying at a mental health facility.From here, to the Beach Boys song ""Wouldn't It Be Nice?"", we see a montage of the urban rubble and decay enveloping Flint, interspersed with newspaper headlines about the increasing layoffs, residents moving away, and a news report informing us that the rat population in the city soon outnumbered the human population.Moore also turns his camera to the residents of the more affluent suburbs such as Grand Blanc, who display rather classist and naïve attitudes when it comes to the economic hardships of the city (at a Roaring 20's themed party they are hosting, Moore takes note when they hire laid off workers to be Human Statues).Here, Moore changes course and turns his camera on the Flint Convention and Visitors Bureau, who are in the process of response by promoting a vigorously incompetent tourism policy. The Bureau, in an effort to lure tourists into visiting Flint, permit the construction of a Hyatt Regency Hotel, a festival marketplace called Water Street Pavilion, and AutoWorld, hailed as the world's largest indoor theme park. These efforts fail, as the Hyatt soon files for bankruptcy, Water Street Pavilion sees most of its stores go out of business, and AutoWorld closes due to a lack of visitors just six months after the grand opening. Moore speculates with a bitter wryness that human tragedy is not a major lure for tourists.(AutoWorld would reopen the next summer only to close down again, and in the end was demolished, which is seen in Moore's film 'The Big One'.)Well-known personalities and celebrities are also shown coming to Flint to bring hope to the unemployed, some of them interviewed by Moore. President Ronald Reagan himself visits the town and suggests that former auto workers find employment by moving away... across the country, though the restaurant where they are meeting has its cash register stolen (off-camera) during Reagan's visit by an unemployed factory worker. The mayor pays television evangelist Robert Schuller to preach to the town's unemployed. Pat Boone and Anita Bryant, who have supplied GM with celebrity endorsements, also come to town; Boone tells Moore that Roger Smith is a ""can-do"" kind of guy. Moore also interviews Bob Eubanks during a fair near Flint, during which Eubanks cracks an anti-Semitic and homophobic joke.Moore also attends the General Motors annual 1988 Shareholders Convention, disguised as a shareholder himself. However when he gets a turn at the microphone to air his grievances to the board, and even though he is the last one, Smith seems to recognize Moore and immediately shuts him out and has the convention adjourned, despite Moore's attempts to interject him. In a close up of Smith, he can be heard joking about what he did with a fellow board member before leaving.Moore also meets some of the residents of Flint, who are reeling from the economic fallout of the layoffs. Moore meets a former feminist radio host named Janet who, to find work, joins Amway as a saleswoman. Also met is a former auto worker, angered over the layoffs, who is named James Bond. The most famous resident that appears in the film is Rhonda Britton, who sells rabbits for ""Pets or Meat"".(The scene many believe was the reason 'Roger & Me' received an R-rating features Britton killing a rabbit on-camera by beating it with a lead pipe. The rabbit fights back before and during the early part of the beating.)Prevalent throughout the film is Sheriff's Deputy Fred Ross, who worked at a Flint GM plant for 17 years before accepting his new job as a sheriff's deputy position, whose job now demands that he go around town carrying out evictions on families unable to pay their rent or mortgages on their houses or apartments.During all of this, as the film progresses, Flint's crime rate skyrockets, with shootouts and murders becoming all too common. Crime becomes so prevalent, that when the ABC News program ""Nightline"" tries to do a live story on the plant closings, someone steals the network's van (along with the cables), abruptly stopping the broadcast. Living in Flint becomes so desperate, that Money magazine names the town as the worst place to live in America. The residents react with outrage and stage a rally where issues of the magazine are burned. Ironically, the residents play the song ""My Hometown"" by Bruce Springsteen during the rally, seemingly unaware it is about a town becoming overcome by crime and extreme poverty.At the film's climax, after three years of trying to track down the elusive and insulated Smith for a personal interview, Moore finally confronts Smith at the chairman's annual 1988 Christmas message in Detroit. Moore and his crew film Smith as he is shown expounding about generosity during the holiday season, concurrently inter-cut with scenes as Sheriff Fred Ross evicts another family from their house. After Smith's speech, Moore hounds Smith where he finally has his up-close-and-personal confrontation with Roger B. Smith. He addresses Smith from a distance (two bodyguards are clearly seen restraining Moore and his camera crew from getting physically close to Smith). The face-to-face encounter between Michael Moore and Roger B. Smith is shown as this:Michael Moore: Mr. Smith, we just came down from Flint where we filmed a family being evicted from their home the day before Christmas Eve. A family that used to work in the GM factory. Would you be willing to come up with us to see what the situation is like in Flint, so that people...Roger B. Smith: (cutting Moore off) I've been to Flint, and I'm sorry for those people, but I don't know anything about it, but you'd have to...Moore: Families are being evicted from their homes on Christmas Eve.Smith: Well, I'm... listen, I'm sure General Motors didn't evict them. You'd have to go talk to their landlords.Moore: They used to work for General Motors, and now they don't work there anymore.Smith: Well... I'm sorry about that. What can I do? It's done. What do you want me to do about it?Moore: Could you come to Flint with us? Just for a few hours to see what...Smith: (walks away) I cannot come to Flint. I'm sorry.Dejected by his failure to bring Smith to Flint to see the crime-ridden slum that it has now become due to the closing of the GM factories, Moore proclaims in the final shot of the movie (over a construction crew tearing down a closed down GM factory building): ""Well... I failed to bring Roger to Flint. As we neared the end of the twentieth century, the rich got richer, the poor got poorer, and people everywhere now had a lot less lint, thanks to the lint rollers made in my hometown. It was truly the dawn of a new era.""After the closing credits, the film displays the message: ""This film cannot be shown within the city of Flint, for all the movie theaters have closed."""
