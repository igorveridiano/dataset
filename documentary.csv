Two young writers try to pitch their script to the big and famous.::Hugo Lopes <hlopes@esoterica.pt>
"Long time friends and aspiring Toronto-based filmmakers Kenny Hotz and Spencer Rice (who Kenny calls Spenny) have written a movie a transgender mob comedy called ""The Dawn"" the script which they are trying to sell to get produced. They envision the movie to be a big budget Hollywood production with an all-star cast rather than a low budget flick. Through cold calling they quickly learn that they will need one piece of the movie in place - whether it be financing or a major star or director signed on - before anyone else will really listen to them. More importantly they need a reputable agent to do the leg work for them. They take the opportunity of the 1996 Toronto International Film Festival - a festival where many of the Hollywood elite attend - to pitch the movie to whomever will listen. Some people do give them advice as well as advice concerning the making of this documentary however they garner no solid leads. Thus they move to the ultimate step in trying to get their movie made: go to Hollywood and knock on doors.::Huggo"
This tells a story literally 'hidden from history'. In the 1960s and 70s British governments conspiring with American officials tricked into leaving then expelled the entire population of the Chagos islands in the Indian Ocean. The aim was to give the principal island of this Crown Colony Diego Garcia to the Americans who wanted it as a major military base. Indeed from Diego Garcia US planes have since bombed Afghanistan and Iraq. The story is told by islanders who were dumped in the slums of Mauritius and in the words of the British officials who left a 'paper trail' of what the International Criminal Court now describes as 'a crime against humanity' .::Anonymous

Slavoj Zizek examines famous films in a philosophical and a psychoanalytic context.::Samovarkov
THE PERVERT'S GUIDE TO CINEMA takes the viewer on an exhilarating ride through some of the greatest movies ever made. Serving as presenter and guide is the charismatic Slavoj Zizek acclaimed philosopher and psychoanalyst. With his engaging and passionate approach to thinking Zizek delves into the hidden language of cinema uncovering what movies can tell us about ourselves. Whether he is untangling the famously baffling films of David Lynch or overturning everything you thought you knew about Hitchcock Zizek illuminates the screen with his passion intellect and unfailing sense of humour. THE PERVERT'S GUIDE TO CINEMA cuts its cloth from the very world of the movies it discusses; by shooting at original locations and from replica sets it creates the uncanny illusion that Zizek is speaking from 'within' the films themselves. Together the three parts construct a compelling dialectic of ideas. Described by The Times in London as 'the woman helming this Freudian inquest' director Sophie Fiennes' collaboration with Slavoj Zizek illustrates the immediacy with which film and television can communicate complex ideas. Says Zizek: 'My big obsession is to make things clear. I can really explain a line of thought if I can somehow illustrate it in a scene from a film. THE PERVERT'S GUIDE TO CINEMA is really about what psychoanalysis can tell us about cinema.'::P Guide Ltd.

In the 1970's an ambitious filmmaker visits the small town of Utah to film a talent show.::Gasmaskproductionsbooks
"It begins in 1979 with the chance meeting in a Salt Lake City parking lot where filmmaker Trent Harris is approached by an earnest small-town dreamer from Beaver Utah. Harris jumps at the chance when the young man invites him to come to the small town of Beaver to film a talent show. At the show the man dons black leather blond wig and performs in drag as Olivia Newton John. Harris captures it all on tape. What unfolds is a strange funny and ultimately poignant portrait of a true outsider. Not willing to let the story go Harris then created a dramatic piece ""Beaver Kid 2"" based on the documentary. This interpretation shot in 1981 on a home video camera with a budget of $100 features the young Sean Penn as the Beaver Kid re-enacting the same scenario. Still possessed Harris then rewrote the script cast Crispin Glover in the lead and in 1985 created the final segment ""Orkly Kid"" as an American Film Institute project. The three pieces were re-edited compiled and finally screened at the Lincoln Center in New York City in July of 2000.

On assignment in Venezuela two documentary filmmakers find themselves in the middle of a political coup detat overthrowing President Hugo Chavez's government. As popular with the lower class as he was despised by the rich Chavez has been a controversial figure since taking office.

Photographer Edward Burtynsky travels the world observing changes in landscapes due to industrial work and manufacturing.::sienel
Jennifer Baichwal's cameras follow Edward Burtynsky (1955- ) as he visits what he calls manufactured landscapes: slag heaps e-waste dumps huge factories in the Fujian and Zhejiang provinces of China and a place in Bangladesh where ships are taken apart for recycling. In China workers gather outside the factory exhorted by their team leader to produce more and make fewer errors. A woman assembles a circuit breaker and women and children are seen picking through debris or playing in it. Burtynsky concludes with a visit to Shanghai the world's fastest growing city where wealth and poverty high-rises and old neighborhoods are side by side.::<jhailey@hotmail.com>
Canadian photographer Edward Burtynsky posits that man made landscapes define who we are as people. He sees a certain physical beauty in the order and/or symmetry in some of these landscapes despite the negative reasons for them or the subsequent degradation they pose to the environment and people around them. The most extreme examples of these landscapes he finds in China. In manufacturing two examples he photographs are at the opposite ends of the size scale: ship building where a certain balance is required in the product itself and electronics assembly. With the latter it is not only the rows upon rows of laborers doing the exact same task but the minuteness of and efficiency in what they are producing. Other examples he photographs are villages where electronic waste recycling is the primary industry. Again there are the extremes of massive waste heaps against the minute components the laborers of all ages are salvaging. Cities are the most aggregate man made landscapes and he looks specifically at the recent development of Shanghai perhaps the fastest growing city in terms of absolute growth. But the vastest example he photographs is the construction and subsequent effects of the Three Gorges Dam where entire villages looking like bomb sites are dismantled since they will eventually be under water.::Huggo

Through archival footage and dramatic readings of his personal writings the life of Nazi Germany's Propaganda Minister Josef Goebbels is examined.::Kenneth Chisholm
"The Nazi propaganda mastermind behind Hitler speaks in first person as actor Kenneth Branagh reads pages of the diary kept by the chief of propaganda Joseph Goebbels revealing the man's most inner thoughts. Joseph Goebbels (1897-1945) was a symbol of Germany's Nazi regime and a twentieth-century icon of maniacal cruelty. His name has been synonymous with cynical unscrupulous and at times successful propaganda. The life of Joseph Goebbels is far more complicated and disturbing than labels like ""genius of spin"" or ""Reich Liar-General"" would suggest. The chronicle shows how Goebbels continually ""restaged"" and reinvented himself -- from his early days as a radical ""popular socialist"" to his tragic end. The film lets Goebbels speak for himself through the diaries he kept without interruption from 1924 to 1945 as never before seen historical footage from German archives traces the life of the second most powerful man of the Third Reich detailing his initial attraction to the Nazi party and his adoration of Hitler. The result is a fascinating psycho-gram of a man who careened extravagantly between self-pity wild extermination fantasies and political excesses.::Sujit R. Varma"

In September 2004 the student body representatives of Utah Valley State College invited controversial filmmaker Michael Moore to speak on campus two weeks before the Presidential election. An unanticipated uproar from the students and community ensued. Moore protestors claimed university funds should not pay for Moore's visit while those in support of Moore fought to defend free speech. A community once considered politically passive was stirred to action and the conflict played out in the media and several public forums. Those opposed to Moore's visit in an effort to have the invitation rescinded resorted to death threats petitions law suits and bribery. Moore supporters living in the high concentrate of Mormon conservatism struggled to be heard to defend new ideas and to keep plans for his visit on track. Steven Greenstreet the film's director tracks the personal stories of the key figures embroiled in this controversy as well as opinions of the community at large. By delving into the personal motives and expectations of those involved Greenstreet effectively presents the causes and effects of this unprecedented debate.

Jim (Chuck Pierce Jr.) a seven-year-old country boy is sent by his mother to get help from some of the townsmen after she spots the monster near her house. Receiving no help from the skeptical men Jim hears the monster scream and years later as an adult states ""It scared me then and it scares me now.""Other residents are introduced and the incidents in which the monster was seen or heard are recounted. First shown are Smokey Crabtree and his son Travis trappers who live near the creek and subsist off the fertile land which provides a pleasant home for them until the sun goes down after which they spot the monster.John P.

Few humans could make their way into the swamp depths where the monster was rumored to live. According to the monster's legend which has evoked terror over the past fifteen years the creature prowls the swamps and creeps out occasionally at dusk.Hunter Fred Crabtree (Jeff Crabtree) once saw the Fouke Monster and now reports: ""Assuming it is a wild man or a gorilla"" he refrains from shooting it in case it is human.

In the morning they find their cat dead from fright.Later a thirteen-year-old boy rushes into the woods after what he believes is a deer.

"A documentary-style drama about the ""Fouke Monster"" a Bigfoot-type creature that has been sighted in and around Fouke Arkansas since the 1950s."
A documentary-style drama which questions the existence of a monster in an Arkansas swamp. It is really more of a glimpse at lower-class swamp culture from the seventies though than a monster flick.::Sean Taylor <st52@cornell.edu>
An early 1970's docudrama about a Sasquatch-type creature that terrorized the small town of Fouke Arkansas for several years. Many of the persons who claim to have experienced these events actually played themselves in this movie version. The film had a big premiere in Fouke and went on to become a minor drive-in hit grossing over $20 million domestically and appearing repeatedly on many late-night horror TV slots throughout the rest of the 70s and spawning two sequels and a remake. In addition the film's visual style is cited as the inspiration for the look and pacing of 'The Blair Witch Project'.::<Tyler@rccinc.com>

A surrealistic documentary portrait of the region of Las Hurdes a remote region of Spain where civilisation has barely developed showing how the local peasants try to survive without even the most basic utilities and skills.::Michael Brooke (corrected by Benny Jansson)
In this documentary short by director Luis Buñuel he travels to Las Hurdes a remote region of Spain which was connected to the outside world only in 1922 with the completion of a road. The residents of the area - spread across several villages - lives in poverty and in isolation from the outside world. They survive mostly on a diet of potatoes and beans with meat available only a few days a week. In fact they eat goat meat only when one of the animals dies. Inbreeding results in a disproportionately large number of people with mental disabilities. The title refers to the fact that the residents did not know how to make bread.::garykmcd
The region of Las Hurdes not far from Salamanca is largely cut off from the rest of the world. To reach Las Hurdes it is necessary to travel through the town of La Alberca which itself has some unusual sights and customs.

The lifestyle of the Hurdanos is so primitive that until fairly recently even bread was unknown to them.::Snow Leopard

spoiler text An almost unbelievable documentary that puts the true subject of whether homelessness is truly an epidemic of some nature or a choice. Shown the daily routine of a homeless man (Ted) he finds $100000 in one of his usual dumpsters in a briefcase and a new view into the life of this man begins. From his excuses and reasons to why he is homeless to his choices the audience gets a first hand look at how his life alters and his beliefs change. He proceeds to buy ludicrous items and yet reconnect to those he's not spoken with in years but all the while the money trickles away faster and faster. He even buys a car for a woman he likes in a bar. Waste is the optimum word here and amazing that the filmmakers viewed this all before them. The ending is not what is hoped for but maybe inevitable based on the man himself and his choices.

"'Religulous' is a 2008 American documentary film directed by Larry Charles and starring political comedian Bill Maher. According to Maher the title of the film is a portmanteau derived from the words ""religion"" and ""ridiculous"" implying the satirical nature of the documentary that is meant to mock the concept of religion and the problems it brings about."
Bill Maher's take on the current state of world religion.::Anonymous
"Bill Maher interviews some of religion's oddest adherents. Muslims Jews and Christians of many kinds pass before his jaundiced eye. Maher goes to a Creationist Museum in Kentucky which shows that dinosaurs and people lived at the same time 5000 years ago. He talks to truckers at a Truckers' Chapel. (Sign outside: ""Jesus love you."") He goes to a theme park called Holy Land in Florida. He speaks to a rabbi in league with Holocaust deniers. He talks to a Muslim musician who preaches hatred of Jews. Maher finds the unlikeliest of believers and in a certain Vatican priest he even finds an unlikely skeptic.::J. Spurlin"
Comedian and commentator Bill Maher who grew up Catholic of a Catholic father and Jewish mother believes that organized religion is a detriment to the progress of society. He also believes that many tenets of the various religions worldwide will end up being self-fulfilling prophecies because man can now achieve them. He has trouble understanding the long held tenets that if described today in any other western context would be deemed crazy such as the story of Jonah and the big fish or a virgin birth. Maher has discussions with leaders and followers of various religions both in the mainstream and on the fringe to try and understand why their beliefs are so strong while both sides try to convince the other to see things from the other side. Specifically with United States based Christianity he has discussions with those associated on what seem to be the inherent incompatible beliefs of Americans such as between religion and science nationalism and consumerism as well as the incongruence between the purported plain life of Jesus against the wealthy opulence of modern day Christian monuments and most Christian leaders. Although focused primarily on Christianity he looks at Judaism Islam and what may be considered more fringe religions such as Mormonism and Scientology not only in and of themselves but also their tolerance or what is more often their intolerance for views other than their own including that of other religions.::Huggo
With quotes from major figureheads like Thomas Jefferson George W. Bush and Osama Bin Laden Bill Maher with a Jewish-Catholic background sets out to prove that having faith and seeking directions from God is basically ridiculous and may be due to a neurotic disorder. Interviewing Christians Catholics Jews Muslims Mormons scientists gays and atheists he cites that the number of non-believers is increasing in North America. He attempts to prove his point by citing inconsistencies in the Bible the controversial birth of Lord Jesus the inability of religious heads to account for His absence for over 18 years as well as the absence of any concrete evidence that disproves the theory of evolution.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)

This passionate and fluid film is without question the first authentic history of surfing from its humble Hawaiian beginnings to the big business it became to the still-rebellious universe it inhabits today. Riding Giants is a study in individuality and freedom the pursuit and techniques of pure kinetic pleasure and the risk taking and attitudes that characterize its leading figures. For some viewers this is perhaps more than they ever wanted to know. But Peralta's detailed knowledge of the surfing lifestyle its icons and locations its boom and exploitation by the media and the fascination it has held for young men for more than five decades is unparalleled and fuels this expedition for the expert and initiate alike. Closely chronicling the sometimes-life-and-death drama that big-wave riding entails Riding Giants is an often-mesmerizing visual thrill ride. But the most appealing aspect of this often revelatory documentary is the realization that the man versus nature dialectic never ends; the search for the ultimate wave and the spiritual pinnacle can only be pursued but never reached.::Sujit R.

A year ago 36-year-old Jonny Kennedy died. He had a terrible genetic condition called Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) - which meant that his skin literally fell off at the slightest touch leaving his body covered in agonizing sores and leading to a final fight against skin cancer. In his last months Jonny decided to work with filmmaker Patrick Collerton to document his life and death and the result was a film first broadcast in March that was an uplifting confounding and provocatively humorous story of a singular man. Not shying away from the grim reality of EB the film was also a celebration of a life lived to the full.::Leonie Davidson Channel 4
