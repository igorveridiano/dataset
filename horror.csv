Once they are in their room they lay on the bed and start making out and and then Lisa opens her eye's and says something signifying that she is surprised and scared then she tells Ronnie that she has to go tell Donna something. Ronnie says ""of all times"" and pulls out an engagement ring.When Lisa runs out of the room she slams the elevator button waiting for the elevator to open then she see's the door open that leads to the stairs and the killer comes out and she runs to the other stairs. While she is running she trips down the stairs and gets back up. She runs to the base or contruction level hiding from him. Ronnie starts to look for Lisa; and the elevator he takes ends up leading him to the contruction level. He calls out for Lisa but doesn't leave the elevator he is in then the elevator closes. When Lisa thinks the coast is clear she gets up and runs only to be startled by a bunch of pigeons. Then she starts running again and bumps into paint buckets and makes a whole bunch of noise. Thinking that the killer is behind her she starts running and is looking behind her not looking forward she bumps right into the killer and he slits her throat.A few minutes later Detective Nash gets Detective Winn to follow him and a police officer to the parking lot.

In a frantic tone she tells them that the killer is in there. They escort her downstairs but don't see the killer in the room. Once Donna is outside Bobby see's her and hugs her and they get into a police car and before they leave Donna tell's Ronnie that Claire is dead.They bring a S.W.A.T team in the hotel and look every where for the killer and the once they receive word that the killer hasn't been found blood starts to drip from the air conditioning vent in Donna's room where the Detectives are and when they open it the body of the male house keeper falls out but he doesn't have his uniform on. And then Detective Winn starts thinking and comes to realize that the killer walked right past him when the employees were exiting the building during the S.W.A.T search and the killer was wearing the house keepers uniform.Detective Winn calls Nash and tells him that the killer escaped from the hotel and is on his way to Donna's house so they have the house completely gaurded.

Then she wakes up it was only a dream. When she wakes up and looks at the television the same show that was on in her dream is on when she looks out her window Nash is wiping his eye and then when she goes in her bathroom and takes her pills she hesitates to close the cabinet but there is nothing behind her but her window is open in her bathroom she closes it and gets back in her bed.When she tries to hug Bobby he doesnt move so she pushes him a little revealing the slit on his throat. Donna covers her mouth and lets out a small shriek. Before she see's the dead boyfriend Winn pulls up to Nashes car and see's that Nash has also been killed.

"THE INVISIBLE RAY synopsisDiane Rukh (Frances Drake) stares out the window from their home in the Carpathian Mountains upon the road below. Mother Rukh (Violet Kemble Cooper) seated in a chair inquires whether her son Dr. Janos Rukh (Boris Karloff) is still working in his lab. Diane confirms this saying that he is preparing for the delegation of scientists due to arrive from England. Rising from her chair with help from Diane Mother Rukh comes to the window with her cane.
She tells Diane that on a day like this her son Janos discovered the ray from Andromeda while working with his late father. It was holding the lens during that discovery which caused her permanent blindness. They discuss the brilliance of Janos and how he was rejected by other scientists and called a charlatan. Diane says she was told to watch for the headlights coming and notify Janos. Mother Rukh returns to her seat and Diane looks out the window again. Seeing the car approaching she announces that she will go tell her husband. She dons her cape and goes through an outer walkway to another building where she rings a bell and enters. Coming into the lab she tells Janos (who is gazing through a large telescope) that the visitors are arriving. He says he is ready and confident.The car pulls up and several people get out and enter the house. Diane greets Lady Arabella Stevens (Beulah Bondi) who introduces her husband Sir Francis Stevens (Walter Kingsford) Dr. Felix Benet (Bela Lugosi) and her nephew Ronald Drake (Frank Lawton). They are introduced to Mother Rukh who speaks but remains seated. Janos enters and greets each one and is greeted by Lady Arabella who presents her nephew Ronald who she says is a mapmaker and will be valuable to the work in Africa. Janos tells them he has a presentation to show them.In the lab he shows his telescope explaining and showing a device which will capture a ray from Andromeda containing pictures and information from thousands of years ago. Dr. Benet looks at Sir Francis with a knowing look of doubt between them. Janos attaches the device to the telescope and tells them to wait a few moments while he prepares the projector. Coming back from another room wearing a welding mask he reaches into a panel and starts a series of electrical devices which give off sparks and energy. He announces he is ready. Diane leads the way to seats which are protected from dangerous rays by a new kind of barium crown glass which is explained by Janos. He tells them about the distances the ray has traveled and turns on the projector which is the type used in planetariums to show outer space. As he narrates the picture shows a movement that passes our moon Saturn Orion and finally Andromeda. He tells Sr. Francis that he had previously predicted a meteor which struck Earth many years ago in Africa telling him that this will prove it. As they watch the view changes direction back toward Earth as seen from Andromeda but millions of years ago. A meteor is shown hurtling towards Earth and striking in the southern portion of Africa. Those viewing this are stunned. Various comments are made saying this is no hoax.Back in the house brandy is served. Sir Francis marvels at the discovery to Janos asking when he will publish it to the scientific world. He says it is not yet ready. Sir Francis says it would be good to locate this meteor and see what it contains. Dr. Benet suggests that Janos join them in an expedition. Janos says he has no standing before their scientific congress and that he had previously been declared unorthodox and discredited. Sir Francis tells him their expedition will not be under the auspices of any scientific association. Dr. Benet says that he will be doing them an honor. Janos accepts but Mother Rukh tells him no. She says he may make an important discovery but that it will not bring him happiness. She reminds him that Janos is not good with people but is better suited to remain with his experiments.A scientific magazine is shown that has an article about Dr. Benets expedition to Africa to recover Radium X. It mentions that Dr. Rukh has separated from the others. Meanwhile at a camp in Nigeria Dr. Benet shows Sir Francis how he has been healing natives by a medicine he derived from sunlight. A young native child is shown and given back to his mother. Diane sits in her tent hot tired and bored to death since her husband left them to go on his own expedition. She emerges from her tent only to see Lady Arabella and Ronald returning from a hunting trip. Seeing him stirs her. She turns away not wanting to look. A conversation with Ronald and Lady Arabella about Diane reveals that they are interested in each other but that Ronald dares not act because she is married. Meanwhile Sir Francis says he is sick of staying in Africa and will not remain for the sake of anyone.A safari group accompanying Janos arrives near a volcano when suddenly a loud buzzing and clicking sound coming from one of the boxes carried by a native frightens him. It is revealed to be a Giger counter showing the presence of radioactivity. Janos takes the machine and approaches a site giving off steam or smoke. He tells the leader to send a message back to the camp by his fastest runner. A runner is selected by the leader and Janos writes out a message telling him to give it to Diana and wait for an answer. He says he has found what he is looking for but not to tell anyone where they are.Antelope stew is served at the camp but not everyone is interested in eating. Diane and Ronald avoid glances over the table at each other but it is obvious that they are mutually interested in each other and this causes great discomfort. About this time the runner arrives and the note is given to Diane who reads it. She reports only that Janos will not return right away but believes he is on the right track. Going to her tent she asks the leader to meet with her and the runner. A small team is prepared to accompany her to see her husband. This is observed by Ronald who then confronts Diane of her plans. She tells him she must go to her husband right away. He tells her hes not surprised that she wouldnt disappoint any man.Dressed in a protective suit and helmet Janos is lowered into the volcano by rope controlled by natives. He uses a mining hammer to extract a sample of glowing sparkling rock which he puts into a safe container. Returning to the natives he is told they do not like the area because there are many devils. After the leader tells him they all want to leave he tells them to watch a rock standing alone on a precipice. Loading the rock sample into a projector he focuses it on the rock and shines the beam. The rock is disintegrated and melted before their eyes. He tells them they may leave if they want to but threatens to turn the ray on them if they do. They beg and pledge their continued support.That night a meal is brought to Janos by one of the natives. He tells him to take the lantern inside the tent so it will not attract bugs. When the light is taken away Janos begins glowing in his hands and face. Seeing this the native cries out in horror. Janos sees his hands glowing and enters the tent. Turning down the lantern he grabs a mirror and sees his face glowing. When the light is turned on the glow cannot be seen. He remarks to himself that it has poisoned him. Sitting down on his cot to think the dog approaches him and he reaches to pet it. The dog dies and Janos realizes that his touch is deadly.Diane and her party arrive and she is pointed toward his tent. Seeing her coming Janos draws the tent closed and turns out his lantern hoping she will not enter. She notices the light go out and stops at the tent door to call him. Not wanting her to see or touch him Janos questions why she came and tells her she must leave in the morning. She is shown a tent for her to stay the night but is heartbroken and cries upon her cot. Janos gathers up the rock sample along with his mask and protective suit and starts out into the dark. Passing close by her tent he hears her sobbing and pauses.Dr. Benet is shown mixing chemicals in his tent. Wearing full protective gear Janos shows up with the runner and calls out to Benet entering the tent. He tells Benet not to touch him saying that he found the element and it is ten times more powerful than radium but that it has poisoned him. They step outside into the darkness and Benet witnesses Janos hands and face glowing. Confessing that his touch is deadly they re-enter the tent. Janos asks Benet for help. Benet says there is an antidote for radium poisoning which is made from radium. Janos gives him a sample of the element and his chemical analysis which he has written down. Benet says he will begin at once to develop an antidote and that Janos can hide in a small equipment tent.Diane leaves on her way back to base camp. Meanwhile Dr. Benet wakes Janos and shows him in the dark that his skin no longer glows. He tells him that the antidote was given him at midnight and that the effect is only temporary. Touching his hand he demonstrates that Janos is not lethal at this time but cautions him that he must take doses of this daily for the rest of his life or the condition will recur and eventually kill him. Janos is given the formula on paper as well as a kit containing samples of the antidote and a syringe.Diane and Ronald have a discussion about their relationship saying there is no point in denying it now. At this point a bell rings calling them to supper.Natives sound jungle drums. Dr. Benet arrives at Janos camp and approaches him. When asked how Benet found him he is told they followed the sound of the drums which stated that a white man had found magic in the mountains. They go into the tent and Janos tells him that he has harnessed the power of the element to destroy cities. Benet asks if he can develop its power to heal and do good. Saying that will come later he brags about his great discovery. Benet tells him that this was anticipated by himself and Sir Francis and that they must all share the discovery. Benet says Stevens is on his way to present the sample to the International Scientific Congress meeting in Paris. Janos argues that it is his discovery and says they are stealing it from him. Benet assures him that Janos will receive credit for it but reminds him they are united for a common purpose and that this element is too powerful and important to entrust to just one man. He says that Diane has taken ill and gone back to England. Janos is given a note from his wife telling him that she believes that he no longer loves her and is now involved with someone else. Benet confirms that it is Drake. This further infuriates Janos who tells Benet to leave before he turns the ray on him. Benet leaves.A newspaper shows that the Benet expedition has left Africa and that Dr. Rukh has returned to his lab in the Carpathian Mountains. Inside Janos turns the ray on his mothers eyes hoping to restore her sight. After a few moments she confirms that she can see. She tells him he has much work to do but he tells her he is leaving in the morning for Paris. She warns him not to go for he will find tragedy there. In case of tragedy he says keep the formula which he has written down and sealed in an envelope for his mother to keep.In Paris we see Dr. Benet in his office who sees many patients using the ray to heal. One girl has her sight restored and she and her parents rejoice. At this moment Janos arrives and Benet tells him that his discovery is helping to heal many people. Benet tells Janos that the Nobel Prize has been awarded to Janos and that all Paris is waiting to honor him. Janos says it looks like he is late again and declares that only he can correctly harness its power. Benet reminds him that is why the discovery was too important to entrust to just one man. Saying the counter-active is still working Janos asks about Diane. He is told that she is working for Lady Arabella and that she and Ronald are in love. Benet tells him that Diane will do nothing until she hears from Janos. He replies that will happen soon enough and leaves.Wandering through the city Janos finds a man who looks like himself and promises to help the man. About the same height and build they go off together.Lady Arabella is seen dictating to Diane who types onto paper. The maid comes bringing the newspaper and giving it to Arabella. She reads the headline and gives it to Diane. It shows that Dr. Rukh has been found dead his body mutilated by the effects of the Radium X.Diane and Ronald are seen at their wedding at the Church of the Six Saints. As they are leaving Janos watches from a distance as they get into a car to leave. He looks up at the statues of the six saints and pictures each of them as representing himself Benet Diane Ronald Arabella and Francis. Taking a room facing the church he plots to kill each of the other five people.At the Stevens home Arabella is talking to Benet about the marriage and noted that Sir Francis has not come down from his room. She sends the butler up to see about him. Before the butler can get halfway up the stairs one of the maids comes screaming into his arms. He goes up to see while Arabella questions the maid. She cannot speak but only screams. Rushing back down the butler calls for Dr. Benet to come saying only  Sir Francis! Sir Francis!. Entering his room they find Francis dead on his bed with a look of horror on his face. Dr. Benet asks for an ultraviolet camera which he uses to shoot pictures of Francis eyes. Developing them he sees captured in the reflection on the mans cornea the image of Janos.The next day there is a disturbance in the square below. The landlady (May Beatty) brings Janos his breakfast and the morning paper telling him that one of the statues was destroyed. He sees in the paper the death of Sir Francis. Gazing at the second statue he calls the name of Lady Arabella.The next day the papers announce the death of Lady Arabella the third death in wake of the curse of Radium X. Diane and Ronald come into the bedroom where Dr. Benet and the authorities are with the body. He tells Diane not to look and for Ronald to take her away. Then he asks to show the Chief of the Surete (Georges Renavent) some evidence. As the lights are turned out the cover is pulled back to reveal a glowing handprint on the victims neck. Benet says it was done by someone poisoned by Radium X. Meanwhile Diane blames herself for the deaths saying they would all still be alive if she hadnt come on the expedition and married Ronald. He tells her not to think like that saying he will fight with all his strength. She says how can you fight something you cannot see or touch?The paper headline shows that the second statue has been destroyed and people are upset. A discussion is held with Benet Ronald and the Chief about Janos. It is suggested that the two men go into hiding. Ronald proposes a trap to draw Janos so they can arrest him. Benet says for the papers to announce that the remaining three will leave for an unknown destination after holding a lecture on Benets experiments with Radium X. He will invite distinguished scientists who will only be admitted by card which the police promise to verify. Benet warns that if the police fail to stop him at the gate that the house lights will be darkened at midnight (the time of the lecture) so that Janos can be seen glowing. It is a risk they are willing to take.The night of the lecture the police are seen checking the cards of each scientist who enters. In the rain the last scientist Professor Meiklejohn (Frank Reicher) is seen walking with his umbrella. Janos appears and stops him introducing himself as someone else who remembers his lecture on radiology. Saying he is on the way to the lecture the Professor locates his card in his pocket. Janos suggests they have a drink of Napoleon Brandy from his flask. They step aside and the flask is handed to him to drink. The touch kills Meiklejohn who collapses. Janos takes the card and enters in his place. The police confirm him and he enters but remains outside so he can observe through a window.Inside Benet greets everyone and tells them he must make final adjustments. Entering his lab with a gun Benet looks around and heads for the outside door opening it. Janos comes in and confronts him. The light is turned off showing his glowing face and hands. Janos tells him he will kill the remaining three. Benet asks if he ever feels like he used to before the poison altered his brain. Janos answers  not often now.. When Benet reaches for his gun Janos grabs his arm killing him.Diane waits upstairs but is very anxious to come down. There is a knock at the door and it is opened revealing Mother Rukh entering. Ronald greets her and she is told that Diane is upstairs. At that moment the lights are cut in the whole place. Diane lights a candle and Janos is seen going upstairs with his glowing face. She rushes into the bedroom and tries to close the door but he forces it open. He approaches to try and touch her but hesitates. Trying again he announces he is unable to kill her and goes out. She faints. Outside on the landing he faces his mother who tells him he broke the first rule of science. He says he needs time so he can kill Drake taking out his kit for more of the antidote. As he does this Mother Rukh strikes it with her cane tip destroying the contents. As he begins to smoke he tells her that maybe its better this way. Turning away he goes upstairs and crashes through a window falling to the ground below as a fireball. There is nothing left. The head of the Scientific Congress congratulates Mother Rukh for her sons work. Handing him the envelope she says that he is dead but part of him will continue to help mankind."

"This film puts an interesting twist on the horror genre by placing the storyline in the American West of the 1800s.Rev. John Keyes (Roy Thinnes) and his wife Lorna (Lynn Loring) have broken a wagon wheel and are stranded in the arid desert while traveling on their way to John's new post as a preacher. Unrelenting sun and dehydration have them nearly ready to succumb to the elements when a handful of citizens from the out-of-the-way town of San Melas happen by and rescue them.Under the care of the townspeople and in particular the town patriarch Caleb (Ray Milland) his hauntingly beautiful mute daughter Deliverance (Yvette Mimieux) and Bethia (Gloria Grahame) John quickly recovers but his wife Lorna continues to suffer recurring headaches weakness and general ill health. Her illness postpones their moving on to John's awaiting post. Deliverance is seen fashioning a wax doll in the image of John's wife in her workshed where she makes home made candles.Deliverance is showing a growing attraction to John something that doesn't pass the notice of his wife who becomes insistent that they leave as soon as possible despite her illness to John's awaiting post in another town. John is conflicted because he is also finding himself attracted to Deliverance and is becoming enamoured of the townspeople and their adoration of him. He finds their ways quaint and old fashioned - Caleb explains that they all migrated from New England to start new lives in the West thus bringing old fashioned ways with them.John gives a sermon that seems to have sparked new life in the townspeople and even brings about a miracle healing a crippled boy. The townspeople don't want John to leave and proceed to rebuild the town church which had burned down the year before; they ask him to stay and replace the pastor who had died. John's wife however makes him refuse the offer and he sees her becoming more and more unreasonable and shrill about leaving. He chalks it up to her serious illness getting worse. When they are finally ready to leave Lorna is brought down by another attack and rendered unable to leave her bed effectively ending any hopes of leaving the town.
Meanwhile Deliverance has clothed her wax doll in a snip of material taken from Lorna's cloak and given it hair provided by Bethia taken from Lorna while unconscious.The town continues to celebrate the turnaround in its luck and attributes it to Rev. John - the mine thought to have been tapped out and on the verge of being boarded up suddenly reveals a new cache of gold; a local outlaw named Moon (Henry Silva) who has been extorting money from the townspeople returns to kidnap Deliverance as ""payment"" until the new gold can be mined. He is stopped by Rev. John who in a moment of desperation shoots and kills Moon as he is kidnapping Deliverance and riding away.John has effectively risen to the status of hero with the townspeople. Yet he suffers from recurring nightmares and visions of a man beaten and bloodied running after him. Each time John eludes this man by running into the waiting arms of Deliverance. One night after awaking from such a dream - John encounters Deliverance outdoors and gives in to his attraction to her. Nearby Moon - who was supposedly dead and buried by the townspeople watches and delights in John's fall from grace.Consumed with guilt over his shooting Moon and illicit attachment to Deliverance while his wife was lying near death Rev. John attempts to give the first sermon in the rebuilt church baring his heart as a flawed preacher - To his shock and bewilderment the congregation begins to laugh at him. They then let him know who they really are - Deliverance identifies herself as Lilith the one who ""loved Adam before the gift of Eve"".In the end we see John strung up from one of the rafters of the church as the church burns down around him in a ritual of unholy offering. The townspeople are happy and celebratory. He realizes too late that the man he saw in his visions and dreams chasing him was actually the previous pastor who met a similar end trying to warn him.Finally the film flashes forward to modern times. We see a broken down station wagon with a man wife and child in the middle of the desert. A pickup truck happens by with a few people from San Melas (Caleb Deliverance etc). who give the stranded family a ride back in to town..... in the rear view mirror the name of the town is seen backwards: ""Nas Salem."" Which is to say Salem Massachusetts."

"A voiceover narrator warns the viewer that the film we are about to watch contains scenes of stomach-churning gore. The visual reveals an average looking man going into a theater and sitting down. Corresponding with the narration he pulls out a handkerchief and gags into it. The narrator explains that this shot along with a buzzing warning sound will be inserted into the film before all the gore scenes and that it is intended to allow the viewer to look away in time if they have a weak stomach. The film then begins after the credits which are superimposed over images of a graveyard.In a funeral home called The Happy Halo we see Bill a mortician at work preparing a freshly delivered corpse for viewing. The funeral director asks Bill is he will stay late to work on an ""emergency"" case that's being delivered that evening the deceased victim of what seems to be a bear attack. Bill agrees. The funeral director who is more than a little bit creepy stumbles through the graveyard gets into his hearse and drives around for a long time speaking to himself in a voiceover narrative. Intercut with this are scenes of Bill slicing into the corpse he's working on. For some reason the funeral director returns and helps Bill put the finishing touch on the corpse: cotton balls to make the cheeks seem more full.From here we see two young couples taking a day trip in a power boat. After boating to an island where they swim and make out on blankets they decide what to do next. Having grown tired of the local rock concert scene Richie and his girlfriend Julie want to spend the night in a graveyard. Alan agrees but his girlfriend Lisa Richie's sister isn't into the idea. Richie says it will be a wild time and he has brought along some marijuana that he thinks will help them enjoy the creepy experience more. The three of them drag Lisa to an abandoned graveyard where they find a vault that has been left open.When they go inside the vault it starts to rain so they decide to hang around for a while. Richie gets the idea to perform a Satanic ritual. Kneeling around a coffin the four of them join hands while Richie starts his incantation. At first nothing happens so Richie turns a nearby crucifix upside-down and reissues the incantation.This time something happens. All around the vault corpses begin to rise out of the graves and they descend on the group. Pushing their way into the vault the zombies kill Julie and seriously injure Richie. Alan and Lisa manage to escape with the wounded Richie while the ghouls devour Julie. Lisa and Alan take Richie to a hospital where doctors perform surgery on him but they are unable to save his life. A doctor tells them that Richie is dead and Lisa passes out in shock. They put Lisa to bed in an empty room and give her a sedative to help her sleep while the doctor questions Alan about what happened to them.It is here that we realize that the corpse Bill was preparing for the ""bear attack"" victim was Richie. He is delivered to the funeral home while Lisa has a disturbing dream in the hospital. She dreams that she is standing over Richie's coffin in the funeral parlor where he awakens and kisses her on the mouth leaving a great amount of blood behind. Lisa screams and imagines that she wakes up in the hospital room where she bites open Alan's throat and stabs a nurse to death. Alas this is only a nightmare and Lisa awakens for real.Meanwhile at the funeral home the director gets drunk in his office and falls asleep at his desk. Later he is awakened by an anonymous phone call. For some reason this prompts him to investigate the funeral parlor where he finds zombies feeding on the corpses. In a strange case of editing the film makes it appear as if the funeral director has his eyes ripped out by the zombies. But there is a sudden jump cut to the man being tended to by orderlies in an insane asylum. They put him in a strait jacket while he screams from an isolated room that he is not insane."

"This is taken from Wikipedia - set in chronological order but not the order of the film. The film begins with the suicide of Peter and ends with Karen in the hospital. This is a synopsis of the director's cut so some events may not be featured in the original PG-13 version. Kayako Saeki (Takako Fuji) a young Japanese woman is unhappily married to Takeo Saeki (Takashi Matsuyama). She becomes obsessed with Peter Kirk (Bill Pullman) an American college professor working in Tokyo. She writes about her feelings for him in a diary. She follows him and sends him love letters. One night Kayako returns home and enters her bedroom upstairs. She finds her husband reading her diary. In a rage Takeo attacks Kayako shoving her to the floor banging the walls while yelling and screaming. Kayako breaks her ankle and crawls down the stairs but before she can escape Takeo catches her and snaps her neck.Takeo looks up to see their eight-year-old son Toshio Saeki (Yuya Ozeki) at the top of the stairs; a witness to the murder. Takeo drags Toshio to the bathroom and drowns him in the bathtub. Takeo also slits Toshio's cat's throat and tosses the carcass on the floor of the bathroom. He wraps Kayako's body in plastic trash bags and places it far in the corner of the attic. He puts Toshio's body in his bedroom closet and tapes it shut with Duct tape and then hangs himself.In order to find out why Kayako is sending him the letters Peter Kirk comes to the Saeki residence the next day with one of Kayako's love letters in hand. He sees Toshio's hands hanging out of the bathroom window bruised and scratched. Peter goes inside and decides to stay with the boy until the parents return. Peter looks through the rest of the house entering Takeo and Kayako's bedroom in the back where he finds several family photos in a pile on the floor. Kayako's face has been torn out of every one of them. He finds Kayako's diary and thumbs through it learning more about Kayako's obsession with him.The closet door catches his eye and upon inspecting it he finds the cut-outs of Kayako's face nailed all over the door and smeared with blood. Kayako's lifeless corpse falls out from the attic and lands on the closet shelf. Peter runs into the hall and hears thumping noises coming from Toshio's room and finds Takeo hanging from a noose of Kayako's hair. The next morning in front of his wife Maria (Rosa Blasi) Peter commits suicide by jumping off the balcony just outside his apartment bedroom. Matthew Williams (William Mapother) his wife Jennifer (Clea DuVall) and ailing mother Emma (Grace Zabriskie) move to Tokyo as a result of Matthew's promotion. His sister Susan (KaDee Strickland) also lives in Tokyo and helps them find a home. Matthew and Jennifer decide on a suburban house despite Emma's strange reactions to the place. Emma's health and condition deteriorate rapidly following the move. Jennifer becomes disenchanted with life in Japan as she cannot sleep during (what she assumes to be) Emma's restless stirrings unable to speak the language and has gotten lost once on a walk. Matthew assures her things will improve and that if they don't the family will return to the United States.Jennifer falls asleep on a couch in the living room after having made and partially eaten a bowl of ramen which she left on the table. The sound of the bowl hitting the floor wakes her. She scolds Emma for making the mess but then sees a trail of wet child's footprints leading out to the hall. She sees a cat on the landing of the stairs and sees a pair of white arms gently pick it up. She continues upstairs and enters her bedroom (Toshio's former bedroom). The door closes behind her.Matthew returns from work and finds the house in complete disarray with trash strewn everywhere. He calls out to his wife who doesn't answer. He finally finds her on their bed unable to move or speak and struggling to breathe. Before he can call an ambulance he is startled by the sudden appearance of a young boy making cat sounds. He backs up against the closet as Toshio appears suddenly over his head.Later Susan is preparing to leave the office. After attempting to call Susan increasingly becomes concerned from not being able to reach Matthew. She then attempts to visit the house but she is stopped by the sound of moaning coming from the hallway. She quickly exits to the stairs but is frightened when the lights start to flicker and shatter. Susan looks over the railing to see Kayako's ghost crawling up the stairs. Susan flees to the security office seeking help. There the security guard promises to go check it out. Susan watches the monitor as the security guard investigates. Kayako's black ghost materializes in the hallway and walks toward the security camera and Susan runs.Susan takes a taxi cab back to her apartment. She enters an elevator and it ascends several floors. Susan does not notice however that Toshio is standing outside each set of elevator doors she passes. Susan makes it safely inside when her phone rings. It is Matthew claiming to have forgotten her apartment number and asking to be buzzed inside. She tells him where to find her and activates the buzzer with the phone. Before she can hang up the doorbell rings immediately. Thinking Matthew couldn't possibly have had time to arrive she checks the peephole of the door. Shocked to find it is Matthew Susan believes he is pranking her. She angrily throws open the door but no one is there. The death rattle sound emerges loudly through the phone in Susan's hand. She drops and breaks the phone yet the death rattle can still be heard. Cowering in bed Susan reaches beneath the covers and pulls out the rabbit's foot phone charm from her phone and drops it in fear. A lump billows from underneath the covers and moves toward Susan. She lifts the sheets and finds herself staring into the face of Kayako's ghost. It yanks her under the covers and the sheets fall flat upon the now empty bed.Yoko (Yoko Maki) is a girl whose work is to take care of Emma and clean the house. When picking up trash on the floor and stairs she hears someone walking around up in the attic. Following the noise Yoko enters a closet in the bedroom and sees a small door in the ceiling which leads to the attic. Using a lighter Yoko sticks her head up through the door and slowly turns around looking for the source of the sound. She eventually comes face to face with the ghost of Kayako Saeki who attacks her dragging her up into the closet.Karen Davis (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is then called in to work at the house and care for Emma after Yoko disappears. While working Karen finds a room that's been taped shut with cat-like noises coming from it. When she rips off the tape and opens the door she finds a little boy (Toshio). The boy refuses to come downstairs so she asks him for his name. ""Toshio"" he says in a toneless eerie voice. Emma begins stirring and muttering in the other room. As Karen calms her a dark shadow of hair emerges from a corner of the room terrifying Emma. Karen looks up to see Kayako reaching for Emma. Kayako's hair which was covering her face flies back to reveal the whites of her eyes. The irises roll into place and focus on Karen as she backs away in fright.Alex Karen's boss finally arrives to find Emma dead and Karen in a state of shock. Karen is taken to the hospital while detectives question Alex. Detective Nakagawa (Ryo Ishibashi) asks Alex about the people that lived there and tell him that Yoko has been missing from work. The detectives notice that the phone handset is missing from the cradle and push the page button. They trace the sounds to the attic where they discover the corpses of Matthew and his wife. They also make the grisly discovery of a human jaw and wonder to whom it belongs and where the rest of the body might be. Later in the movie Yoko is spotted again by Alex as she is shuffling down the stairs of the caretaking facility where Alex Karen and Yoko work. As he is walking towards her he accidentally slips on a liquid which he discovers is blood when he touches it. Alex calls out repeatedly to Yoko who does not answer in any way until she reaches the bottom of the stairs. She then turns around to reveal her face now horribly disfigured without her jaw and her tongue is hanging out. Alex screams in terror and the screen fades to black.Karen tells her story to detectives emphasizing the appearance of a boy. Over the next few days she is constantly tormented by Kayako in her shower on a bus etc. Frightened but determined she begins to research the history of the house. Eventually she learns of the murders.Detective Nakagawa becomes convinced that the rash of deaths and missing people is connected to the house when he views the entire security video taken at Susan's office building. He watches as Kayako proceeds down the hall then to come face to face with the camera as the video fuzzes out. He then returns to the Saeki house with two cans of gasoline. He is distracted by sounds of Toshio drowning in the bath tub. He enters and finds a boy hanging out of the tub and tries to revive him. His eyes snap open and Takeo appears behind him. He shoves Nakagawa into the tub and drowns him like Toshio.Karen questions Maria Kirk Peter's widow who does not appear to know anything about the house its occupants or why her husband committed suicide. She allows Karen to search through old photos. Karen discovers a living Kayako in the background of every photograph clearly following the couple. Karen then attempts to go talk with her boyfriend Doug (Jason Behr) at their apartment. However she discovers he has gone looking for her after his own investigation. Karen then returns to the house in search of Doug.Inside the house Karen experiences a flashback of Peter Kirk's visit. She watches him reliving the experience with him finding the body of Kayako and leaving the home. Karen flees downstairs. Doug grabs her ankle before she leaves. He is incapacitated and she tries to drag him to the door. A door opens upstairs. Kayako's ghost crawls down the stairs toward them and Doug dies in the same way Jennifer Williams did. Karen opens the door but Kayako's ghost is suddenly there. She slams the door and kicks over one of the gas cans. She takes Doug's lighter and tosses it onto the gas as Doug suddenly becomes Kayako. The screen goes white. (In the director's cut there are shots of Karen being put into an ambulance van).At the hospital Karen learns that the house was saved from burning and mourns Doug's dead body. Suddenly Kayako's hair and arm comes from beneath the sheet that covers him but Karen realizes that it's just her imagination. Kayako then appears behind Karen. As Kayako utters her death-rattle the movie ends with an eyeshot of her."

"""Sleep'walk'er n. Nomadic shapeshifting creatures with human and feline origins. Vulnerable to the deadly scratch of the cat the sleepwalker feeds upon the lifeforce of virginal human females. Probable source of the vampire legend."" - Chillicoathe Encyclopedia of Arcane Knowledge 1st edition 1884.Ever-so-virginal Tanya Robertson [Madchen Amick] is working at the local theater in Travis Indiana when sleepwalker Charles Brady [Brian Krause] a new student who just transferred from Paradise Falls Ohio comes to see the double bill (They Bite and Scream Dream). She's pretty he's cute; they make a date to shoot photos together at Homeland Cemetery.While driving home from school Charles is stopped by his English teacher Mr Fallows [Glenn Shalix] who tries to blackmail Charles on grounds that there is no such place as Paradise Falls in Ohio and that Charles' transcripts are fake. Charles responds by ripping off Fallows' hand and killing him. Charles continues on driving at breakneck speed past Sheriff Andy Simpson [Dan Martin]. Charles is having fun trying to outrun the law until Andy's cat Clovis pops his head up and looks out the window. Charles' face suddenly shifts into his catform and then back to human confusing Andy. When it looks like Charles isn't going to outrun Andy he pulls off the road and makes his car go invisible. However Clovis can still see Charles which upsets Charles greatly. When Andy finally gives up the chase Charles makes his car turn from blue to red and drives home.Cats are beginning to amass in the Brady's yard. They've set traps but some cats seem impervious to them. 'It's starting again' Charles tells his mom remembering all the previous places they've tried to live but been discovered and driven out. Mary Brady's [Alice Krige] concern however is with the fact that she is starving. When is Charles going to bring her the nourishment she needs? 'Tomorrow' Charles promises.Tanya is looking forward to her date with Charles. She's even packed a picnic lunch along with a bottle of wine which she hides from her parents. As Charles makes grave rubbings Tanya takes photos of both the
graves and of Charles. Everything is hunkydory until while engaged in a bit of kissing Charles starts to suck out Tanya's breath. Tanya manages to clout him in the head with her camera but he doesn't stay knocked out for long. When he tries again to steal her breath she skewers his eyeball with a corkscrew.Meanwhile Charles' car has turned back to its original color just as Andy and Clovis drive by. When Andy stops to investigate Tanya comes running out of the cemetery Charles in pursuit. As Andy tries to calm Tanya down Charles rams a pencil into Andy's ear. Charles attempts once more to take away Tanya's breath but Andy shoots him in the back. Undaunted Charles takes the gun from Andy and shoots him with it. Back to Tanya. Just when it looks like Charles is going to win Clovis leaps at Charles' head and begins biting him. Tanya climbs in the squad car locks all the doors and frantically tries to get a message through to the dispatcher. Charles manages to get the cat off his face and speeds away in his blue car.The police arrive [look for Stephen King's cameo as the cemetery caretaker]) and take Tanya home. They don't quite buy her story about Charles arriving in a red car and leaving in a blue car nor about his face changing but they do take her camera to develop the pictures she took of Charles. Charles is in a bad way. When he gets home his mother tries to care for him but she also has troubles. The yard is full of cats and now the police have arrived looking for Charles. She decides that the best course of action is to make the car Charles and herself invisible just as the police break down her front door.While Tanya languishes in a bubblebath Mary Brady comes to the Robertsons' front door bearing a bouquet of roses. When Mr Robertson [Lyman Ward] tries to turn her away Mary breaks the vase and cuts his face with the glass. When Mrs Robertson [Cindy Pickett] comes in from the kitchen to see what all the commotion is about Mary tosses her out the window. When Deputy Horace [Monty Bane] comes in from the kitchen (where he was eating some of Mrs Robertson's home-cooked corn-on-the-cob) he fires at Mary but misses badly. When he returns to the kitchen to call headquarters for reinforcements Mary stabs him in the back with an ear of corn. When Tanya comes downstairs to see what's going on Mary knocks her out cold and carries her outside.More police are arriving including Captain Ira Soames [Ron Perlman] State Police. He pointedly tells Mary to put Tanya down so Mary bites off three of his fingers. Using Soames' gun she shoots two of the patrol cars causing them to burst into flames. She hoists Tanya into the third car and drives home. When she arrives she finds that her house and yard are crawling with cats... millions and billions and trillions of cats.While Mary is forcing Tanya to dance with Charles who is near death the police are sneaking up on the Brady house. When Charles tries to feed on Tanya's breath she pokes out Charles' eyes with her fingers. Mary is
irate. 'You killed my only son' she screams at Tanya. Clovis and the police break in also letting in some cats who leap on Mary. She fights them off while the policeman tries to get Tanya out of there. Mary catches up with them killing the policeman by impaling him on a picket fence. Tanya jumps into the patrol car and tries to get it started. Mary in cat form breaks the window and attempts to pull Tanya from the car. Cats start leaping on Mary... millions and billions and trillions of cats (anyone recognize the reference? Hint: It's a classic children's book). For some reason the biting cats cause Mary to burst into flames. Engulfed in fire Mary takes human form long enough to leap on the patrol car windshield and scream at Tanya one last time 'You killed my son... my only son.' As Mary burns up in the driveway Clovis jumps into the car with Tanya. As Tanya hugs Clovis the other cats start leaving there being nothing more there for them. [Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl]"

Bill tells his father he is close to perfecting a drug that will assist in transplantation without rejection. They walk back into the O.R. to talk and Jan joins them. Bill reminds his father about the medical convention in Denver. Jan checks on his reservations. Dr. Cortner reveals that the hospital has been making inquiries about missing human parts. He tells his son ""But I can't cover up for you anymore. The Superintendent had it out with me. He thinks it's you whose been stealing those limbs from the amputee operations."" Bill admits he needs them for his work. Before he leaves Dr. Cortner asks his son about his weekend plans cautioning him about the country house ""Place gives me the creeps. I should have sold it when your mother died."" Bill promises Jan they will be married in a few weeks.A nurse (Doris Brent) catches Bill and Jan before they leave the hospital. She tells him about an important phone message from Kurt at the country place ""Something terrible has happened and he wanted you to come right out."" Bill drives Jan's car up to the country house. He drives too fast and crashes the car. Bill is thrown clear of the wreck but Jan is trapped inside the burning car. Bill retrieves her head wrapping it inside his jacket. He runs back to Dad's house in the country carrying Jan's head in his arms like a football. When he gets to the palatial estate he calls to his assistant Kurt while pounding on the front door. Kurt (Anthony La Penna as Leslie Daniel) answers the door still wearing his lab coat. His left arm is paralyzed his left hand is drawn back into a claw the skin dark and leathery. Bill explains there has been an accident. He is cradling Jan's head in his arms he is frantic. ""I've got to save her"" he tells Kurt. Kurt tries to relay his concern about the thing in the closet but Bill insists ""For Gods sake Kurt this is urgent. Do as I tell you before its too late. I can't waste precious time arguing with you."" The two walk downstairs to the lab and hook up equipment. Bill carefully pours a test tube of liquid into a flask. The time is now 10:20 and we see what all the frantic work involved. Jan's bandaged head sits in an enamel pan attached to various tubes and wires. Kurt is astonished and tells Bill ""The eyelids I saw them move. It can't be. My eyes are deceiving me."" Bill replies ""What you see is real. What's done is done and what I've done is right. It's the work of science."" Jan starts to revive and mumbles ""I remember fire. Burning. Let me die. Let me die."" Bill reminds Kurt he's had transplant success but Kurt asks ""Transplant her to what?"" Bill considers the question then replies ""I've brought her back. She'll live and I'll get her another body. I can make her complete again."" Kurt disagrees and voices his objections. Bill does admit he can only keep her alive for 48-50 hours in the pan. We learn that Kurts arm withered and deformed was an earlier unsuccessful experiment using an earlier formula. Kurt reminds Bill about the creature in the closet. Bill approaches the heavy door padlocked on the outside. Something inside is breathing abnormally. Bill peers inside through an observation door near the top. He is horrified by what he sees. ""Keep it locked"" he tells his assistant. He then turns his attention back to his fiance ""I've got to think about her now. I've got to find her a body."" ""How are you going to go about getting one?"" Kurt asks. Bill assures his assistant that there are ways.It is late evening and Bill decides to go cruising at a local strip club The Moulin Rouge. Outside the entrance he sees two cut out display boards of strippers a blonde and a brunette. He likes what he sees obviously the discriminating shopper. Inside the blonde stripper (Bonnie Sharie) does her show for the patrons of both sexes. Bill wanders in and takes a stool at the bar. Blondie wanders over and bumps and grinds to get Bill's attention. The brunette stripper (Paula Maurice) a bit masculine looking is jealous of her co-worker. When the blonde finishes her act she heads for the dressing room. This gives the brunette a chance to make eyes at Bill. A table becomes available and Bill sits down next to the brunette and chats. Blondie comes back and joins Bill at his table. At the house Jan is resting in her pan. Blondie goes back to her dressing room and Bill follows. They chat. Jan begins to mumble again about dying. Bill is getting a little anxious and tells the stripper ""You may be just what I'm looking for."" Before Bill can close the deal the brunette enters the dressing room and changes. Bill is concerned that a witness is more than he can handle. When the girls get catty with each other Bill excuses himself. The brunette tells Bill ""Come back later I'll remember you."" ""That's what I'm afraid of"" he replies. The blonde and brunette strippers get into a fight. We close this charming scene with a camera pan up the wall to a pair of cat paintings and someone meowing. [Note: Yes we get it a cat fight!]Jan awakens and looks around the lab. Her brain waves register high on the equipment. She calls out to the creature in the closet ""What has he done to you?"" It is mute so she directs it to knock once if it hears her. Kurt is attracted by the noises downstairs. Jan expresses her anger and disappointment at Bill for what he's done to her. She invites the creature to join her in a plot of revenge. Kurt goes down to the lab and Jan pretends to be asleep. Kurt tip-toes over to the closet and listens at the door. It pounds on the door and Kurt jumps. Jan laughs hysterically. Kurt runs over to the lab table and confronts his tormentor. Jan asks Kurt ""What's locked behind that door?"" ""Horror: no normal mind can imagine. Something even more terrible than you"" Kurt replies. But Jan corrects him ""No my deformed friend. Like all quantities of...horror has its ultimate and I am that."" Kurt explains that Bill's experimental mistakes are summarized by the creature behind the closet door. Jan realizes what Bill has been doing at the country house and Kurt's part in the grotesque work. Kurt lost his arm in a lab accident and Bill promised to restore it. Jan realizes that Bill intends to transplant her head onto another woman's body. Jan explains the new serum has given her power Bill never expected. She demonstrates for Kurt. The terrified lab assistant runs when the creature tries to force the closet door off its hinges. Kurt runs into Bill in the living room and asks if he was successful in finding a woman. Bill explains he can't be the last person seen with a woman before she disappears.The next morning Bill goes cruising in his car. He runs into a woman acquaintance Donna Williams (Lola Mason). Donna suggests a bathing beauty contest so Bill invites her into the car. He makes an excuse to stop at home first but they run into another woman. A friend of Donna Jeannie Reynolds (Audrey Devereal as Devereau) joins them in the car. Now with a witness Bill's plans for Donna are scuttled and the three go to the beauty contest. They sit down just as the M.C. (Bruce Kerr) starts the show. The first contestant is Helen Appleton (uncredited). She is wearing a one-piece swimsuit. Bill nods his approval. Next up is Betty Brockton (uncredited) a blonde with her hair in a single braid and wearing a modest two-piece swimsuit. Terri Lund (uncredited) is the third contestant. She is wearing a one-piece and the crowd applauds. Peggy Howard (Marilyn Hanold) is the final contestant and Bill leers approvingly. Donna notes ""She has the second nicest body I've ever seen."" Bill assumes Donna is just trolling for a compliment and asks ""Second to you?"" But Donna quickly corrects Bill and reminds him of Doris the girl in school who was disfigured by a jealous boyfriend. Donna mentions that Doris is seldom seen and has few friends. Bill is thinking Doris may be perfect for his needs.Jan continues her one-way chat with the creature in the closet and concludes they must stop Bill. Bill drives over to see Doris Powell (Adele Lamont) at her apartment. He walks in and she is posing on a platform for five photographers. Bill sits on the couch and observes the display. Doris stops and puts on a robe and dismisses the photographers. Art (an uncredited Sammy Petrillo) hangs back and suggests some unprofessional work. Doris makes it clear she is not interested and tells him to leave. She confronts Bill ""See it all mister? The show's over. Next time bring a camera and buy a ticket. I'm not running a charity."" Bill reminds her they were class mates but Doris is bitter and tells him she hates all men. She reminds Bill by showing him the scar on her face. Rather than being repulsed Bill explains that he is a doctor and that his father is a very good plastic surgeon and they can fix her face. Doris is not convinced and tells Bill ""I've been doctors. It's no use: the scar tissue is too deep. No one can help me."" But Bill convinces her that new techniques are available. He talks her into a consultation at his home with his father. When Doris asks his motive Bill tells her his version of the truth ""I'm gonna make your face beautiful again cut it off and give your body away."" Doris laughs and explains that she believes him. Doris changes her clothes and they drive to the country house.At Jan's direction the closet creature has been pounding on the door working the hinges loose. Kurt enters the lab with food for the creature. He is in a sarcastic mood so Jan taunts him with ""Your formless sniveling fear becomes you more."" They bicker and Jan directs Kurt over to the closet door. As she distracts Kurt she summons her friend behind the closet door to attack Kurt. It reaches out through the observation door and pulls Kurt's arm inside. As Kurt struggles the creature pulls his good arm off at the shoulder. Kurt wanders around the lab and house smearing blood all over the walls. In cinema's longest death scene Kurt wanders back to the lab and collapses and dies of shock and blood loss. All the while Jan giggles and laughs.Bill arrives home with Doris. Bill tells Doris he will mix some drinks and they will wait for his father to return. Bill discovers Kurt's body in the lab and covers it with a sheet. He closes but forgets to lock the observation door and then he mixes the drinks. He adds a powerful sedative to Doris' drink. Bill walks back upstairs and gives Doris the spiked drink. Doris consumes the drink and then accuses Bill of putting something in her drink. She collapses and Bill carries her down to the lab in his arms. Bill proudly announces to Jan ""I told you I'd bring you a body. A beautiful one. Soon it will be yours."" Bill rationalizes his intentions to Jan as he prepares for surgery. Jan tells Bill ""You must be stopped."" Bill needs quiet so he places a strip of tape over Jan's mouth. Just as Bill prepares to cut off Doris' head a pounding sound comes from the closet. Bill walks over to the door. He does not notice the observation door is unsecured. He looks back at Jan. The observation door opens and a large hand and arm reaches out to the doctor. It pulls him back and the door pulls loose from the casing. A grotesque creature (Eddie Carmel) emerges still holding Bill Cortner through the door. It is a misshapen mess with one bulging eye folds of scar tissue for a face and a pointed head. It carries the door and its victim across the lab. It manages to knock a flask of flammable liquid on the floor starting a fire. It throws Bill to the floor discards the closet door and approaches the doctor. It easily picks Bill up in its arms and chews a sizeable piece of his face off. At Jan's direction it carries the unconscious Doris off the operating table and out of the burning lab. A stunned and dazed Dr. Cortner is still lying on the floor. Jan tells him ""I told you to let me die."" We close to a black screen and Jan laughing. [Note: The end title card reads The Head That Wouldn't Die and a copyright year as 1960.]"

"The film opens with a brief opening title/credits sequence showing a Jack-o-Lantern accompanied by John Carpenter's famous theme music. The shot slowly moves closer and closer. Once it stops the lighting quickly changes to reveal that the eye and nose form the shape of a man holding a knife.The film begins on October 31 1963 a cold Halloween night in Haddonfield Illinois. In the middle of a street stands a two-story white Victorian house. Someone begins walking toward it and sees a 17-year-old Judith Margaret Myers (Sandy Johnson) through the front door kissing her boyfriend (David Kyle) passionately. As they move towards the couch in the living room the person outside follows them around the side of the house and watches through the window. The boyfriend asks Judith if they are alone and she replies that someone by the name of Michael is around someplace. Her boyfriend puts on a clown mask jokingly and kisses her. She laughs and tells him to take it off and he suggests that they go upstairs to have sex. They run up the staircase as the person outside the house follows them back around to the front. The Shape sees the light in the upstairs window go out and begins swiftly walking back to the side of the house through the kitchen door. Quickly the Shape opens a drawer and grabs a very sharp knife. It begins slowly creeping through the dining and living rooms and reaches the bottom of the staircase. There Judith's boyfriend is putting his shirt back on and leaving the house. Judith calls down the staircase for him to call her the next day. He takes one last look upward and quietly leaves. As soon as this happens the shape begins walking up the stairs into the dark hallway. Looking down it sees the clown mask on the floor. The Shape picks it up and pulls it over its face. Entering Judith's bedroom it sees her sitting in front of her mirror nude except for a pair of panties brushing her hair. She has her back to the shape and is unaware that it is standing there. The Shape walks up behind her and she finally feels its presence. Swirling around she sees that it is Michael (Will Sandin) the person previously referenced and is annoyed quickly covering her breasts. But suddenly Michael raises the knife and begins stabbing her repeatedly in various areas of her body. After a few seconds she falls to the ground covered in blood. Swiftly the shape walks out of the bedroom down the stairs and out the front door into the yard as a car pulls into the driveway. They are Mr. and Mrs. Myers Judtih's parents. Seeing Michael they pull off his clown mask revealing the face of a young 6-year-old boy staring into space with a blank expression still clutching the knife in one hand.On October 30 1978 nearly 15 years later in Smith's Grove Illinois a doctor by the name of Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance) and his assistant a nurse named Marion Chambers (Nancy Stephens) are driving to the local sanitarium to have Michael Myers now 21 years old and still very dangerous taken to a hearing in front of a judge where his future incarceration will be determined. In the car is a matchbook with an advertisement for the Rabbit in Red Lounge. As Marion quietly smokes a cigarette she questions Dr. Loomis's desire to do this when suddenly they see that several mental patients are lurking around the entrance to the sanitarium. Dr. Loomis rushes out of the car into the rain to see what is going on just as a patient leaps on top of the car. It is Michael Myers (now played by Nick Castle). Marion rolls down the window to see what he is doing up there and his hand reaches through the window and grabs Marion's hair causing the car to swerve off the road. He and Marion struggle for a moment until she pulls away and moves toward the other side of the car. Instantly Michael's hand appears at the window behind her and shatters it. Marion startled opens the car door and jumps out. Michael climbs in and drives away. Dr. Loomis runs over to Marion and consoles her telling her that the evil is gone.The next day on Halloween in Haddonfield a young girl of about 17-years-old named Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is leaving her house to walk to school. On her way out her father Morgan Strode (Peter Griffith) a real estate agent tells her not to forget to drop a key off at the old abandoned Myers house because a family is coming by to look at it later. As Laurie continues down the streets an 8-year-old boy Tommy Doyle (Brian Andrews) walks up to her. Laurie is babysitting him that night. As they walk together the Myers house comes into view. Tommy tells Laurie not to go up there because something bad happened there once. As she drops the key under the mat someone appears inside and looks through the front door at her. Laurie leaves and continues walking with Tommy who says he received the information about the house being haunted from Lonnie Elamb (Brent Le Page) whom Laurie says will probably never get out of the sixth grade. Tommy leaves soon after this and Laurie walks on singing to herself when suddenly the Shape from inside the Myers house appears right behind staring after her.Meanwhile back in Smith's Grove Dr. Loomis is debating with another doctor Terence Wynn (Robert Phalen) about whether or not Michael has returned to his hometown in Haddonfield. Dr. Wynn doesn't think Michael could drive to Haddonfield and blames Dr. Loomis for not warning the staff about the potential for Michael's outburst. Dr. Loomis angrily gets in his car and drives away.Later that day Laurie sits in English class at Haddonfield High School when she sees the Smith's Grove Sanitarium car parked on the street outside the window. Michael stands beside it in a greyish-white mask watching her. Laurie is frightened and continues to look back when suddenly the teacher calls on her to answer a question startling her. Laurie responds to the question and when she looks back through the window Michael and the car have disappeared.Meanwhile at the Haddonfield Elementary School the bell rings and children begin running out of the building. Tommy is leaving school carrying a large pumpkin followed by several bullies who are taunting him about how the boogeyman is coming to get him that night. Tommy is confused not knowing about the boogeyman but is also frightened. He begins to run away but he trips and falls squashing the pumpkin. The bullies laugh and run out through the playground gate when instantly Michael jumps out and grabs one of them. Terrified the bully scurries away. Michael climbs back into the Smith's Grove Sanitarium car and begins to drive alongside Tommy who is walking down the sidewalk sadly. Michael then drives off.On the highway somewhere between Smith's Grove and Haddonfield Dr. Loomis stands at a telephone booth speaking with someone from the Haddonfield police department who seems resistant to the idea that Michael could be coming to Haddonfield. Dr. Loomis frustrated again hangs up the phone. But before he can drive away he notices a tow truck parked nearby in a grassy area. Inside he finds Michael's white hospital gown and the Rabbit in Red Lounge matchbook. Now Dr. Loomis is sure that Michael is in Haddonfield and rushes back to his car not noticing the unclothed body of the tow truck driver (Barry Bernardi) lying in the nearby grass.Meanwhile the students are being released at Haddonfield High School. Laurie is walking home with her friend Lynda van der Klok (P. J. Soles) who's complaining about how many school activities she will have to be involved with in the next day being such a popular and beautiful girl. Laurie however seems to be a quiet bookworm who has nothing to do except babysit. As they walk along another young girl named Annie Brackett (Nancy Loomis) finds them. Annie and Laurie talk about their babysitting assignments for that night; Laurie is babysitting Tommy and Annie is babysitting Lindsey Wallace (Kyle Richards) who lives across the street a few houses away. While they are talking the Smith's Grove Sanitarium car goes speeding down the street. Annie yells down the street at the driver that speed kills and suddenly the car stops but instantly speeds back up and leaves again. Forgetting this matter and not realizing that they had a close encounter with Michael Annie and Lynda share a cigarette and begin devising a plan to get Lynda and her boyfriend Bob together at the Wallace house where Annie is babysitting to have sex.Laurie and Annie continue on when suddenly Laurie sees Michael hiding behind a bush ahead of them. Annie doesn't see him and when she rushes over to the bush there is nobody there. Annie thinks that Laurie is seeing men behind bushes because she is desperate for a date. Annie reaches home leaving Laurie behind who still thinks that there was someone behind that bush. Looking behind her she accidentally runs into Mr. Brackett (Charles Cyphers) Annie's father and the sheriff of Haddonfield. Laurie is startled and Brackett  the local sheriff replies that it is Halloween and everyone is entitled to one good scare. Laurie laughs and walks back towards her house. Walking into her bedroom she looks out of the window and sees Michael standing in her neighbor's back yard staring up at her from between two rows of clothes hanging on a line. One second he is there the next second he is gone. Suddenly the phone rings and Laurie runs over to it. When no one answers and she only hears the sound of chewing she hangs up terrified. The phone rings once again and it is Annie on the other end. She asks why Laurie hung up on her and she replies that she thought it was an obscene phone call. Annie says that she had her mouth full and couldn't speak telling Laurie that she will be picking her up for their babysitting assignments at 6:30 pm. Laurie hangs up and lies on her bed trying to console herself. Later that day Annie picks Laurie up at her house to go babysitting and they drive around for a while smoking a marijuana cigarette.Meanwhile Dr. Loomis arrives at the Haddonfield Cemetery with the graveyard keeper (Arthur Malet) apparently with the intent to visit Judith's grave. They discover that Judith's headstone is now missing; Dr. Loomis knows now there can be no doubt that Michael is somewhere in Haddonfield.Back in Annie's car the girls smoke marijuana and talk. Laurie tells Annie about seeing someone in her neighbor's back yard while behind them Michael still driving the Smith's Grove Sanitarium car slowly cruises down the road stalking them. Laurie begins to cough after smoking the marijuana when suddenly they spot Mr. Brackett in front of a store in the distance and Annie orders Laurie to get rid of the joint. They pull into the parking lot and speak with Mr. Brackett who says that someone--probably kids--broke into the store and stole a few masks ropes and knives. Annie replies that he blames everything on kids and that he is a cynical father. Mr. Brackett dismisses them because they will be late and they leave down the street toward their baby-sitting assignments. After they leave Dr. Loomis pulls up to the store and asks to speak with Mr. Brackett who says it will be about ten minutes. Dr. Loomis stands waiting on the sidewalk as the Smith's Grove Sanitarium car passes right behind him.In Annie's car Laurie is worried that Mr. Brackett knew that they were smoking pot and Annie thinks there is nothing to worry about. They begin discussing next day's school dance and Laurie reveals to Annie that she has a crush on a boy named Ben Tramer. Soon after this they arrive at their destinations. Annie drops Laurie off at the Doyle house and pulls into the driveway of the Wallace house. As she walks into the house the Smith's Grove Sanitarium car pulls up along the curve. Michael gets out the car and hides behind a tree in the Wallace yard watching Annie.Meanwhile Dr. Loomis and Mr. Brackett arrive at the abandoned Myers house. They begin to search inside when they find a partially eaten dog (off-camera). Mr. Brackett says a man couldn't eat a dog like that and Dr. Loomis replies that this isn't a man. The two of them walk upstairs and Dr. Loomis shows Mr. Brackett the bedroom where Judith was murdered. Suddenly a downspout falls away from the building and breaks the window near them startling Dr. Loomis who draws his gun. He begins describing his 15-year experience of watching Michael seeing nothing but ""pure evil"" inside him. Mr. Brackett asks what they should do and Dr. Loomis tells him to inform the rest of the police just to ask them to keep their mouths shut. Dr. Loomis decides to stay behind and wait for Michael because he thinks he will return to the Myers house.At the Doyle house Laurie sits reading King Arthur to Tommy. Tommy becomes bored and says that he doesn't like that book and reveals several comic books that he has been hiding in the couch saying that his mom doesn't want him to read them. Soon after this Tommy asks Laurie what the boogeyman is but suddenly the phone rings before she can reply. It is Annie calling from the Wallace house. She tells Laurie that she just spoke with Ben Tramer and told him that Laurie was really attracted to him. Laurie becomes angry and embarrassed and begs Annie to say that she didn't talk to him. Right at this moment Tommy looks out the window and sees The Shape standing next to the Wallace house a black silhouette. He screams for Laurie that the boogeyman is outside but when Laurie looks out the window no one is there and she continues her conversation on the phone. At this time Michael has reached the back of the house near the kitchen door. Inside Annie is in the kitchen making popcorn not noticing Michael. She complains about Lester Lindsey's dog bothering her with his barking. Suddenly Annie accidentally pours the butter all over her shirt and pants and removes them while Michael continues to watch. Annie finds a small button-up shirt and puts it on wearing nothing else other than panties. At this moment Michael accidentally knocks a hanging plant to the ground shattering it and drawing Annie's attention to the kitchen door. But Michael has gone to another window when Lester who is now outside sees him and begins barking. Annie complains to Lindsey again that Lester is getting on her nerves but soon after this she hears Lester stop barking and begin whimpering. Outside Lester is dangling in the air and his feet are starting to go limp as Michael kills him.Inside the Doyle house Laurie and Tommy sit watching The Thing. Once again Tommy asks Laurie about the boogeyman. Laurie says that the boogeyman and all other Halloween superstitions are all make-believe and that Halloween is only a time when people play tricks on each other. Seeing that Tommy's still afraid Laurie promises that she won't let anything happen to him. Tommy asks to make the jack-o-lantern at this time and they go into the kitchen. At the Wallace house Annie goes to the outdoor laundry room in the back yard and puts her clothes in the washing machine never seeing The Shape peering in at her from the door and windows. After accidentally locking herself inside Annie calls for Lindsey to come and let her out but Lindsey doesn't hear her. When the phone rings Lindsey answers it and it's Annie's boyfriend Paul (an uncredited John Carpenter). Lindsey finds Annie stuck in the laundry room window and releases her. After they go back into the house Paul calls again and tells Annie that his parents left his house and he has an opportunity to sneak out to see her. He asks her to come pick him up. Annie takes Lindsey across the street to the Doyle house so Laurie can watch her for the time being. Laurie is reluctant but Annie promises to talk to Ben Tramer in the morning and tell him that they were just fooling around when she called him. Finally Laurie agrees and Annie goes back to the Wallace house. She enters the garage whistling and singing to herself and tries to open her car door but it is locked. Frustrated Annie goes back into the house and finds the keys brushing her hair a bit in the mirror and still wearing nothing underneath her coat except a shirt and panties. Reentering the garage she opens the car.... not noticing that it is now unlocked. Just as she sits down in the driver's seat she realizes what has just happened. She reaches up to wipe the fog from the windshield when suddenly Michael leaps out from the back seat and grabs her throat. He mercilessly strangles her until she weakens and then swiftly withdraws a knife and slits her throat. Annie's eyes go wide as her face slides down the window and she dies.Inside the Doyle house Tommy and Lindsey are watching television when Tommy hides behind a curtain and whispers Lindsey's name trying to scare her. Tommy turns around and to his horror he sees Michael carrying Annie's lifeless body back into the Wallace house. Suddenly Lindsey bumps into Tommy and they both scream. Tommy yells for Laurie saying that they boogeyman is outside again but she tells him to stop talking about it. Tommy complains that no one believes him but Lindsey decides that she will.Meanwhile at the Myers house Dr. Loomis stands waiting behind a bush. After a while three children one of whom is Lonnie Elam come along and dare each other to go inside. Trying to protect them Dr. Loomis speaks in a menacing tone and yells at them to go away. They scurry away from the house and run down the street. Suddenly Mr. Brackett jumps out behind Dr. Loomis startling him. Mr. Brackett complains telling Dr. Loomis that it will take more than fancy talk to keep him up all night crawling around bushes. Dr. Loomis warns him once again of Michael's evil and Mr. Brackett questions if all the families and children in Haddonfield could be lined up for a slaughterhouse. Dr. Loomis replies that they could be. Mr. Brackett agrees to continue looking for Michael in the case that Dr. Loomis is right but he adds that if he is right ""Damn you for letting him go.""Back at the Wallace house Lynda and Bob arrive in a van both sipping from cans of beer and are considerably drunk. They go over the plan that Annie will distract Lindsey while they go to the bedroom upstairs to have sex not knowing that Lindsey is at the Doyle house and that Annie is dead. Bob lifts Lynda into the air and carries her into the house. Once they go inside they find all the lights off and no one there. Seeing this as an opportunity they fall onto the couch kissing passionately while Michael silently watches nearby.At this time in the Doyle house Laurie Tommy and Lindsey have finished carving the jack-o-lantern and walk into the living room making spooky noises. They all sit down on the couch to finish watching the movie when suddenly the phone rings. It is Lynda calling from the Wallace house while lying on the couch with Bob's head in her lap. She asks where Annie is; Laurie replies that she went to pick up Paul and she thought she'd be home by this time. Laurie tells Lynda to call when Annie gets back because she has Lindsey at the Doyle house and she needs to know what time to put her to bed. Enthusiastically Lynda hangs up the phone and tells Bob that Lindsey is gone for the night and they run upstairs. Laurie watches as the lights go out across the street.Upstairs in the Wallace house Lynda and Bob Simms (John Michael Graham) are having sex while the phone rings continuously. Lynda warns Bob not to answer it for fear it might be the Wallaces. Bob takes the phone off the hook and they resume the moment not noticing Michael's shadow sliding across the wall. Soon after this they stop and Lynda lights a cigarette for each of them ordering Bob to go downstairs for a beer. She giggles as he goes downstairs this being the best night of her life. Downstairs Bob gets two beers out of the refrigerator and is about to pour them into glasses when he hears a noise. He looks outside through the kitchen door but no one is there. Annoyed he opens the pantry door when suddenly Michael jumps out and shoves him against the set of cabinets on the opposite wall! Michael lifts Bob into the air stabs a sharp knife through his stomach and into the wall and Bob dies. Michael stands there for a moment watching Bob's lifeless body like a curious animal. Upstairs Lynda sits filing her nails when the bedroom door creaks open and Michael stands there covered with a sheet and Bob's glasses over his eyes. Lynda thinks this is Bob dressed as a ghost and asks him where the beer is. He won't answer so she drops the sheet around her exposing her breasts. When the Shape still won't answer her she becomes annoyed and gets up to call Laurie and ask where Annie and Paul are. She dials the number but just as she is about to speak Michael comes behind her and strangles her to death with the telephone cord! At which time she screams leaving Laurie thinking it is Annie playing a prank. Finally after Lynda dies Michael picks up the phone listening to Laurie's voice. She puts the phone down and looks out the window as all the lights in the Wallace house turn off. Laurie dials the number for the Wallace house but no one answers. Going upstairs Laurie sees that Tommy and Lindsey are sound asleep.Meanwhile back at the Myers' Dr. Loomis still stands waiting when suddenly he sees the Smith's Grove Sanitarium car! Dr. Loomis begins running down the street sure of where Michael is. At the Doyle house when Laurie still receives no word from anyone she grabs her keys and curiously ventures across the street. Upon reaching the front door she finds it locked and rings the doorbell. There is no answer. Laurie walks around the side of the house to the kitchen door. Going inside she searches around for any signs of Annie Lynda or Bob thinking this is a trick. Not finding them anywhere she walks upstairs and sees the light from a jack-o-lantern streaming underneath the bedroom door. Opening it she sees in horror Annie's lifeless body on the bed with Judith Myers's headstone above her. In tears Laurie backs against the closet when suddenly Bob's body drops down into the doorway hanging from the ceiling. Laurie screams in terror just as the closet door opens revealing Lynda's body as well. Laurie runs out of the bedroom into the hallway backing against the wall. Out of a darkened room Michael's mask appears in the doorway behind her. Laurie walks forward standing against the balcony.... when Michael reaches out with his knife and stabs her in the shoulder! Laurie screams louder than ever and falls over the balcony railing crashing down onto the staircase and spraining her ankle. Michael rushes over to the top of the stairs and begins walking toward her. Laurie leaps up and rushes towards the front door hurriedly but it won't budge. She runs through the living room to the kitchen locking the door behind her. She rushes to the kitchen door the way she came in but a rake has been shoved under the doorknob outside. She is trapped! Suddenly Michael's hand breaks through the other door behind her as he turns the lock and enters the room. Terrified Laurie smashes through the glass with her bare hand and knocks the rake over. Shoving the door open she runs out of the house and stumbles into the yard. She screams for help and runs onto the porch of another house but no one will help her. Hurrying across the street to the Doyle house she reaches for the keys in her pocket but they are gone! Panicking she bangs on the door but Tommy is fast asleep. Just then Michael appears behind the Wallace house and Laurie begins to yell for Tommy. Grabbing a potted plant she throws it at Tommy's bedroom window waking him. He slowly walks downstairs unaware of the trouble. Finally he reaches the front door just in time and lets Laurie in. She locks the door and orders Tommy to go upstairs. Turning out the lights Laurie believes that she is safe when instantly she sees in terror that a window is open. Scared beyond imagination she crouches down in front of the couch when suddenly Michael leaps out from behind the couch and tries to stab her but he misses and hits the couch instead. Laurie grabs a knitting needle and swirls around stabbing Michael in the neck. He staggers backward and hits the floor apparently dead. Laurie nearly passing out because of blood loss drops the knife that is still in the couch onto the floor and goes upstairs to check on the kids.Outside Dr. Loomis still walks down the sidewalk when Mr. Brackett's police car pulls up. Dr. Loomis tells him that he found the Smith's Grove Sanitarium car and he will head over to where Michael is. Mr. Brackett drives away now truly believing what is going on.Upstairs at the Doyle house Tommy and Lindsey run up to Laurie thinking that it was the boogeyman who attacked her. She assures them that he is dead but Tommy says that she couldn't have killed him because he is incapable of being harmed. At this moment Michael lumbers toward them and Tommy and Lindsey run back into the bedroom. Laurie scurries into another room opening a set of doors leading to the balcony and hiding in a closet tries to fool Michael as to where she actually is. She ties a pair of stockings over the closet's doorknobs but Michael soon begins shaking the doors and reaches through them with his knife slicing the stockings! He breaks down the top half of the closet door and reaches in for Laurie accidentally turning the light on. Laurie grabs a wire hanger and stabs Michael in the eye with its point. He jumps back in pain dropping the knife into the closet. Laurie takes it clutching it in her hands and stabs Michael in the chest. He falls to the ground dead. Laurie carefully slips out of the closet and seeing this drops the knife. Asking Tommy and Lindsey to come out she tells them to go down the street to the McKenzies' house and tell them to call the police. They leave the house screaming attracting the attention of Dr. Loomis who is outside and runs up to the Doyle house.Inside Laurie is slumping against the doorway of the room where she was hiding tired and almost unconscious. She doesn't notice that Michael thought to be dead is slowly rising behind her. Laurie stands up leaving the room when suddenly Michael grabs her by the neck and begins to strangle her. Laurie fights back and pulls his mask off revealing Michael's true face. Instantly Dr. Loomis appears at the top of the staircase and shoots Michael with his gun. Michael falls backwards into another room as Laurie falls against the wall behind her covering her ears. Dr. Loomis chases the murderer into the other room and sees him standing in front of the balcony doors. Dr. Loomis shoots him five more times causing him to fall out the doors and off the balcony. Michael slams onto the ground below appearing to be dead. The doctor looks back at Laurie who says ""It was the boogeyman."" Dr. Loomis solemnly replies ""As a matter of fact it was."" Looking back down below he sees in horror that Michael has vanished but Dr. Loomis knew all along that this would happen. Laurie realizes that Michael still is not dead and begins sobbing. The film ends with a shot of the Myers' house and the sound of Michael breathing heavily behind his mask.Michael Myers the legendary man who came home on Halloween night to kill is still alive somewhere out there..."

He shoots the dog through the head in self defense and proceeds to drive to work.At his dental practice Feinstone's first patient of the day is young Jody Sanders there for his very first dental appointment. Feinstone begins to clean Jody's teeth. Everything goes smoothly at first until he imagines that Jody's teeth are brown and rotten. His dental pick slips stabbing Jody in the gums. Jody's mother picks up her crying bleeding child and leaves angrily.As Feinstone sees his second patient beauty queen April Reign Detective Gibbs investigates the death of Paula's dog. He suspects the perpetrator was the burglar who has been robbing houses in the neighborhood though that criminal has never used a gun before.Alone with April Feinstone sedates her with nitrous oxide so that he can fill a cavity in one of her molars. As she drifts off into unconsciousness Feinstone imagines that she has transformed into his wife. He begins kissing and fondling his ""wife"" on the dental chair then begins to choke her. April starts to cough and half-wakes up from the gas. Feinstone snaps out of his trance and quickly re-buttons April's blouse and finishes removing her pantyhose. Hiding the pantyhose behind a counter Feinstone helps the still-coughing April into the arms of her manager Steve Landers (Mark Ruffalo). He leads them out claiming April is dizzy from the nitrous oxide. Steve returns a few minutes later and furiously punches Feinstone hard in the mouth presumably after what April told Steve about her encounter with Feinstone. They leave angrily threatening a lawsuit for sexual and physical assault on their way out. Feinstone decides to end the day early and sends his staff and patients home. Especially disappointed is Sarah a teenager who desperately wants to get her braces removed.

Feinstone emerges from the house with a kitchen knife and stabs Matt to death.Waiting for Feinstone when he arrives at his practice are Sarah and Paula. Feinstone sees Paula first much to Sarah's disappointment.

As her tooth is destroyed his assistant Jessica questions what he is doing. Feinstone snaps out of his trance and asks Jessica to finish up. Instead Jessica whispers to Paula to leave. When Feinstone discovers that Paula has left he fires Jessica on the spot. She pulls out April's pantyhose from the previous day and threatens to expose Feinstone. Grabbing the hose from her hands Feinstone wraps them around Jessica's neck and strangles her to death.At the police station Detective Sunshine discovers that the bullet pulled from Paula's dog's murder scene only matches one gun in the area: the Walther PPK owned by Feinstone. He and Detective Gibbs drive to the Feinstone house to question him further. Near the pool they discover Matt's body. They quickly break into the house and find the mutilated Brooke tied to the bed but still alive.Meanwhile IRS agent Marvin Goldblum using Feinstone's tax problems as leverage extorts a free dental exam and tries to extort a payoff from the doctor.

Feinstone removes them and shows Sarah her smile in the mirror. As with Jody he imagines her teeth brown and rotting. He pulls out his gun and aims it at her forehead. Sarah slams the exam light into Feinstone's head and escapes. She hides in one of the dental rooms where Sarah finds the blood-soaked Marvin who attacks Feinstone but Feinstone recaptures her.

The two detectives arrive but they are a little too late.They follow him to a university where the doctor teaches dentistry classes. There Feinstone at gunpoint manically instructs all of his students to pull all of the teeth out of all their patients. His vision warps again and he sees all of the people he has mostly killed or mutilated over the past few days including Matt. He shoots Matt who turns out to be a dental student. The detectives burst into the room but Feinstone uses a hostage to escape. Eventually he wanders into an auditorium where an opera singer is practicing. Enchanted he watches her from behind. When he reaches out to touch her she transforms into Brooke who laughs at Feinstone. Defeated he gets on his knees and is arrested by the detectives.In the final scene we see Feinstone in a psychiatric hospital.

Apparently the whole reunion event was nothing but a bad dream that Marty had out of wishing revenge against all those who caused his disfigurement. A little later a doctor responds to an alarm and runs into Marty's hospital room where the nurse stands over him with a syringe. The nurse turns around and it is actually Marty wearing the nurse's uniform while the dead nurse is lying in his bed. Marty shoves the syringe into the doctor's eye killing him too.

"Two young women Helga Borich [Marie Fors] and Monika Tarnek [Ulrike Butz] one or both of whom
may be a direct descendent of Baroness Dania Varga who was burned as a
vampire and witch in the 17th century have arrived at Castle Varga. They
are met by the housekeeper Fraulein Wanda Krock [Nadia Henkowa] and several of her
staff all of whom are dressed in long matronly black dresses.
After getting settled in their rooms Helga Monika and Monika's
girlfriend are taken to see a portrait of the Baroness who is a
dead-ringer for Monika. As a storm brews outside two travelers -- Dr
Julia Malenko [Anke Syring] an anthropologist studying the local superstitions and her
brother Peter [Nico Wolf] -- knock on the castle door. They are having car trouble and
need shelter for the night. During the night the guests are awakened by
the sound of chanting and bongo drums which seems to bring out the libido
in everyone within earshot. Julia begins to suspect that something is
wrong and makes her brother wear a cross made out of garlic cloves. Julia
is wearing one just like it.The next morning Julia recounts the story about Baroness Dania being
burned as a vampire witch during the 17th century. Legend has is that
because she died without being staked her spirit is waiting around to
take over a body and return to life. As the day proceeds Peter and Helga
appear to be falling in love much to the displeasure of Julia who
harbors incestuous feelings for her brother. That night as the chanting
and bongos begin again Helga can barely stand the libido rising in her
body. Meanwhile Wanda is thinking that Julia knows too much. When Wanda
attempts to mesmerize Julia however Julia lifts her garlic cross and
breaks Wanda's spell. That night the chanting and bongos again affect
Helga but this time Wanda tells Helga that she must get Peter's cross in
order to make ""the throbbing"" stop.The next morning Julia warns Peter that there is something going on
at the castle that she doesn't quite understand but that it could lead to
their destruction if they don't leave but Peter doesn't want to go unless
Helga goes with him. When Helga calls him to her room and pleads with him
to help her because her body soul and mind are being destroyed Peter
removes the garlic cross from around his neck and places it on Helga. When
Wanda sees the cross around Helga's neck she grabs a poker lifts the
necklace over Helga's head tosses it in the fire and smiles. Now there
is nothing standing in her way. She admits to Julia who is beginning to
figure it out (having written a book about the Vargas) that Wanda and her
black sisters are actually priestesses of Baroness Dania and that they
are planning for a mating between one of the sisters and a male descendent
of Dania's line an event that can only happen once every nine years
during a particular phase of the moon -- the night of the Vampire. Wanda
also tells Julia that she and her brother are descendents of the traitor
Donnashova[sp?] who fingered Baroness Dania. Fortunately one of her
priestesses scooped up her ashes and they have been been keeping Dania
""alive"" for these past 300 years.Now Julia is really concerned. She tries to talk with Monika but
Monika is ""asleep"" and Julia cannot awaken her so Julia goes looking for
her brother. As the sun sets Monika wakes up and orders her friend who
is now her renfield to bathe and dress her. When prepared Monika and her
renfield head for the dungeon where the priestesses along with Peter and
Helga are ready to perform the ceremony. Wanda kisses Monika which
apparently passes Dania's spirit into Monika's body. Monika/Dania
indicates that she wants to drink Helga's blood. Meanwhile Julia is still
searching for her brother when she is attacked by bats who manage to rip
off her clothes. Fortunately Julia is able to hold on to her cross and
she uses it to chase away the bats.The next morning Peter returns to his bedroom to find Julia asleep
in his bed. Julia tells him that she believes the vampire was reawakened
last night. Peter chastizes her for believing those ""old wives' tales"".
After breakfast Peter Helga and Julia go for a walk during which Julia
finally convinces Peter to leave with her. They spend the day traipsing
through the forest but by nightfall they find themselves back at the
castle where they are greeted by Monika/Dania who plans to drink Julia's
blood and watch her die on a stake. It's not going to be easy because that
garlic cross Julia wears is pretty powerful so she sends Peter to seduce
Julia and make her take off the cross. However Julia notices that Peter
is not wearing his cross and concludes that Peter is acting under the
Baroness's power. Julia uses her cross to ward him off.Plan two is to make Peter strangle Julia but Julia manages to ward
him off again. Later Julia goes looking for Peter who by now is in the
dungeon making love to and having his blood drunk by Monika/Dania. Julia
is chased back to her room by two of the priestesses. A few hours later
Peter comes to Julia's room with no memory of where he's been or what he's
been doing. She puts him to bed and places her garlic cross around his
neck. When the priestesses begin to chant Julia is unprotected and
succumbs to their mesmerism. Fortunately Peter is able to hold Julia back
with the cross and prevent her from going to them.Plan three is to send Helga to Peter with the message that if the
Baroness can't have Julia she'll take Helga instead. When Helga runs off
to join the Baroness Peter grabs Julia and they follow Helga. She leads
them to an altar in the forest where a stake has been erected. As Helga
nears the stake Julia shouts ""No!"" Monika/Dania releases Helga and turns
to Julia biting her neck and drinking her blood. In her weakened state
Julia stumbles near the altar. As Monika/Dania keeps drinking Julia
breaks off the tip of the stake. She falls to the ground the Baroness
zooms down on her and Julia impales her on the stake.""At last they are free"" Julia says as she watches the priestesses
walk off in shock ""and the Baroness at long last is at rest."" [Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl.]

"CASTLE OF BLOOD synopsis-NOTE: In the European version the actors are listed by their real Italian names. In the US version they were given American-sounding names. Below they are referred to in their real Italian names.**On a cold dark night a man is seen outside the Four Devils Tavern in London looking around. Entering he goes downstairs where Edgar Allan Poe (Silvano Tranquilli) is reciting lines from one of his stories to Lord Thomas Blackwood (Umberto Raho) and the bartender. He listens for a moment then introduces himself as Alan Foster (Georges Rivire) a reporter who has been trying to get an interview with Poe. Remembering him as having pursued him without response he invites Foster to sit down. They discuss death and whether there is an afterlife. At one point Sir Blackwood invites Foster to spend a night in his castle atop a cliff overlooking the sea at Providence. He must remain there from midnight to dawn upon which he will receive 100 pounds sterling. Refusing the bet at first Foster offers to try it for 10 pounds. He is told by both Blackwood and Poe that all those who tried before ended up dead. The most recent deaths were a newlywed couple who never returned but are buried in the castle cemetery. Foster agrees and Poe agrees to accompany them to the castle (which is a two-hour ride by carriage) during which he will interview Poe at length.As they arrive at the castle in the middle of the night Poe asks Foster if he has any second thoughts before he is left alone. Having none they bid him goodnight saying they will return in the morning. He waves as they leave. Going inside the gates he wanders through the narrow cemetery. He sees only a black kitten hanging around. As he ascends the steps he finds a woman's garment which he picks up and carries inside with him.Inside he finds an old dusty castle very dark and dank. Lighting a candelabra he begins looking round. He hears a noise and goes to an open window. Looking out he sees nothing and closes it. He taps his cane on an ancient dining table covered in dust. He sets the candelabra down removes his cape and hat and places them on the table. Picking up the candelabra he explores more until he hears a large clock striking eleven. He looks at the grandfather clock which shows 11:30. The pendulum appears still. As he turns away he hears the clock strike once more. He looks and sees the pendulum swinging. As he approaches it stops. He compares the time to that of his pocket watch and sees they are the same.As he looks into another room he is startled by the image of a man. He goes to investigate and finds a full-length mirror. Tapping on it he tells himself not to be afraid of his own reflection. He goes on and sees a portrait of Julia Alert (Margrete Robsahm). As he looks again the portrait seems to be rippling. He tells himself its only a portrait and returns to the table setting down the candelabra and pulling out note paper and pencil. He tells the portrait that he will make some notes and begins writing.All at once he hears music playing and gets up to see. In another room he sees a couple dancing but as he approaches the door it slams shut. Forcing the door open he finds a dark music room with a harpsichord and harp. He lights a candelabra on the harpsichord and noticing sheet music there he sits and begins playing it. Suddenly we see a hand reaching out to touch his shoulder from behind. He is startled and turns to see Elisabeth Blackwood (Barbara Steele) who asks if her brother sent him. Rising he tells her Lord Blackwood made a bet but he didn't know anyone else would be in the castle or he wouldn't have accepted the bet. She tells him she fell out with her brother because she was in love with the gardener Herbert (Giovanni Cianfriglia) and Lord Blackwood didn't approve. He tells her he will leave rather than cause her misery but she insists he stay and win the bet. She says that his room has been prepared. He is surprised and asks how she knew he was coming. She replies that her brother makes the same wager every year on this night and someone comes. As they continue walking the candles go out just as Elisabeth laughs. He asks who blew them out and she answers only the wind. As they pass by the portrait of Julia it seems to be rippling again. Elisabeth doesn't see the rippling but asks about it. Again he tells her he will leave and gather his belongings. She sees the garment he brought in and picks it up smelling it. He tells her he found it outside.They go upstairs to a bedroom where he sets the candelabra on a desk. Elisabeth sits on the bed and calls him to sit beside her. He comes close and she asks about the world outside. He tells her nothing has changed but that it is a shame that the world cant share her beauty. She asks him if he finds her attractive and he admits he does. She asks about him and he tells her there is not much to tell. He is single lonely and works in London as a writer.Suddenly Julia enters the room and says that they have not been introduced. Elisabeth warns Julia not to interfere telling her that Foster was sent to her by her brother. Julia challenges that asking Foster if it is true. He says only that he is there because of a wager. Elisabeth tries to get Julia to leave and not to cause any trouble. When she refuses Elisabeth says that she will leave and does. Julia tells him it is late and that she will also retire. He asks if he will see her in the morning and she tells him no. When he asks if she is leaving she tells him no I only said you wont see me in the daylight. She leaves and he ponders all that was said.Outside in the hall the two women talk. Elisabeth tells Julia that he belongs to her that she is in love with him and they will be happy together. Julia tells her she will not be happy and that he will soon learn the secret of this place. Julia threatens to tell him. Elisabeth is upset and runs off.In his room Foster removes his coat and looks at a small stack of books on the desk. He picks one up and opens it. The title page reads: CARMUS: ELEMENTS OF METAPHYSICS MEDICINE. He goes to the bed to begin reading but is distracted by a noise coming from the door. He notices the door handle slowly opening. He rises and gets his derringer and stands by the door. When he pulls the door open he sees Elisabeth who says that he is still awake. He invites her in and she goes to the bed where she sees the book. She says that she will leave so he can read it. He persuades her to remain telling her how much he likes her and is attracted to her. She answers that she is pleased to hear this and that she wants his body warmth. She asks him to kiss her and embrace her. They embrace and she begs for his kisses and for him to warm her.Meanwhile Julia is listening outside the door. She remarks to herself that she tried to warn Elisabeth but was unsuccessful. She turns to go and runs into William (Benito Stefanelli) who asks about Elisabeth. Julia tells him she will inform Herbert.Alan and Elisabeth are seen in bed where he expresses his joy of meeting her. She tells him she cant be part of his world because he is in the present while hers is in the past. He tells her that he doesn't believe that resting his head on her chest. As he caresses her arm he suddenly notices that she has no heartbeat. He looks at her and calls her name. She answers and he tells her that he was afraid her heart had stopped beating. She tells him that her heart has not beaten for ten years since she died.Suddenly Herbert bursts into the room with a knife and stabs Elisabeth. He runs from the room with Alan following. Alan shoots him and he falls. As he watches the body vanishes. Alan returns to the bedroom to find it empty. He begins calling for Elisabeth going room to room. All at once he encounters Dr. Carmus (Arturo Dominici) who tells him that he will be unable to find Elisabeth. They go into his study where he offers Alan a drink of whiskey. He explains about the three parts of life. The first part (the weakest) is the human body. Second is the spirit within and third are the senses which he explains live on after death in some bodies. Alan scoffs at this and Carmus tells him he will prove it. Removing a small case from a cabinet he produces a small venomous snake which he puts on a table. Cutting off the head he tells Alan to note how the body continues moving without the head and the head though severed from the body is still dangerous enough to bite. Alan says that may be true for reptiles but he doesn't believe its the same for humans. Carmus takes him to the window where he points out below the graves of Elisabeth and the others. He tells Alan that tonight they each will live out the last five minutes of their lives until they died.They ascend a staircase and Alan begs for more details about Elisabeth. Suddenly the clock chimes and Carmus tells him that the time is at hand and that words mean nothing. He is told to watch below. The room plays back the evening of a festive party where Elisabeth was dancing with her husband William who stops and goes to get her a drink. As she waits by a window Herbert knocks from outside. She opens it and he insists on seeing her. She tells him she will try to see him later and closes the window. Julia sees her talking to Herbert but says nothing. William brings the drink to his wife. Sir Blackwood and his wife approach and inform their hosts they must leave. Escorting them outside Elisabeth then turns aside to talk to Herbert. He takes her aside into the stable and demands her loyalty saying that she promised herself to him while her husband was away. Suddenly the dream fades and Carmus tells Alan that their deaths will be replayed tonight as every year at this time.He takes Alan into the bedroom where William and Elisabeth are in bed together. Herbert comes in and strangles William. He then turns on Elisabeth to kill her but he is knocked out by Julia with a candlestick. He falls with half his face indented from the blow. Julia turns to comfort Elisabeth telling her she is now safe. Elisabeth reaches for a knife and stabs Julia. Getting out of bed Elisabeth views the three dead bodies and screams. Alan says he doesn't want to see anymore and that it must be a trick. Carmus tells Alan that there is more for him to see.Alan sees that the bedroom is now empty. No bodies are present. He begins searching again calling for Carmus and Elisabeth. When he reaches the study of Carmus the door opens and he goes in. Next he sees Carmus who takes a drink of whiskey. Hearing a banging noise Carmus takes a candelabra and goes from door to door and window to window until he finds the door that keeps banging open and shut. Opening it he goes downstairs into the crypt room. He passes by an ornate coffin showing a man and a dog to a stone bier. He slides the cover off to see a decomposed woman inside. As he watches she begins to breathe then converts into a mist. Going back to his study he sits down and begins to write. Suddenly Herbert enters and kills him then bites to suck blood from his neck. At this point Carmus comes back into the room telling Alan that he has seen how Carmus met his end. When Alan looks at the desk again no one is there. He picks up the paper Carmus wrote on and reads: Blood is the fountain of life; only blood brings back the dead to life; we will drink from this fountain!!Alan hears ghostly laughter and pulls out his derringer. Realizing the gun will do no good he drops in on the desk and exits the study. Soon he hears more laughter from outside. As the front door opens he hides to watch. The bride (Sylvia Sorrente) and groom enter to spend their wedding night.
As they go upstairs Alan calls out to them to warn them they are going to their deaths but realizes they cant hear him and there is nothing he can do but watch. He notices the door standing open and goes to it. It closes and he tries to open it but the handle breaks off. He realizes he is trapped. He begins calling out loud hoping Carmus can set him free while he is still alive.Upstairs the amorous couple is kissing but hears a noise. He goes to investigate and she begins to undress by the fire. As she gazes at her reflection in the mirror we see Herbert approach from behind. Seeing him she screams as he attacks. Her husband rushes in to find Elsi dead and is killed by Herbert. The scene vanishes and Alan sees the couple approaching him. They tell him it is now his turn. He runs downstairs and sees Carmus who tells him that he is next. He tries to run but each of them are closing in on him. All at once he sees Elisabeth who tells him which way to run. She says they need his blood to be able to live again next year for a few minutes.
Alan runs down a hall and is trapped as the others approach. At the last second Elisabeth opens a door and leads him through. Again she tells him they need his blood but if he can escape they will die. He tells her to come with him grabbing her arm. She cries no that she cannot enter his world. He insists pulling her along through corridors. She continues to tell him that she cant come with him because she is dead. Finally they go outside where she collapses telling him goodbye. Her body deteriorates completely away until she is only dust. He stumbles through the graveyard hearing the voices of the others calling him. As he comes under the tree with the low branches he sees the bodies of the others hanging from high limbs. They all tell him there is no escape and they will live by his blood. He makes it to the gate and steps outside thinking he is safe. Suddenly the gate closes and a metal rod pierces him through killing him and holding his body upright.The next morning Poe and Blackwood arrive in their carriage and Poe remarks how he is standing there. But when they approach they see he is dead. Blackwood takes money from Alans wallet telling Poe he must collect on the debt. Blackwood says he will arrange for burial in the cemetery. Poe says he can now write the story but no one will believe it.The voices of Elisabeth and Alan are heard talking to each other. She says you stayed with me Alan. He replies: yes Elisabeth."

When he leaves she notices a photograph of Charles in her apartment. That night at a party in the apartment Michael again presses Alison for marriage.In the morning Alison meets two more neighbors the wisecracking Gerde (Sylvia Miles) and the mute Sandra (Beverly D'Angelo) who are lovers.At a commercial shoot Alison again collapses frustrating Jack (Jeff Goldblum) the photographer.Charles throws a birthday party for his cat and Alison meets more of her strange neighbors. Later she has a disturbing dream and is awakened by noise from the supposedly empty apartment above her.Alison meets with Miss Logan and learns that aside from the priest the apartment building has been empty for years and the building is owned by the Holy Diocese of New York. Meanwhile Father Halliran is visited by Monsignor Franchino. (In some versions Franchino meets with a group of priests who are a secret order to protecting the world from evil to give them an update them on the events unfolding.) Elsewhere Michael Lerman asks private investigator James Brenner (Hank Garrett) to check out Alison's building.Alone the next night Alison hears more noises and investigates. She sees Chazen's cat eating the pet bird and is pursued by an apparition of her father whom she stabs repeatedly. Alison flees into the street where she is found covered in blood by residents of nearby buildings. The next day two police detectives the veteran Gatz (Eli Wallach) and his rookie partner Rizzo (Christopher Walken) visit Michael and question him about his dead wife Karen's suicide and a second suicide attempt by Alison implying that he is involved in the previous night's incident. Meanwhile police find nothing suspicious in Alison's apartment and match the blood type on her nightgown to her own.Michael discovers that Mrs. Clark one of the supposed guests at Chazen's cat's birthday party was the name of a convicted murderer who was executed in 1949. Later Brenner the private eye is found stabbed to death in his car and his blood type matches Alison's. Detective Gatz connects Brenner to Michael and suspects that Michael hired the investigator to kill Karen and is now trying to drive her insane. When the detectives arrive at Michael's apartment to confront him Alison leaves her boyfriend's home for a walk and stops by a Catholic Church. There she confesses to Monsignor Franchino that she has committed adultery twice attempted suicide and is feeling suicidal again. The monsignor assures her that if she embraces Jesus and returns to the church the feelings will vanish.When Alison returns to Michael's apartment he suggests that she may not have imagined the events and they visit her apartment in Brooklyn Heights. There is no evidence that Alison killed anyone there but she says that some of the things in the room such as the carpet are different. In a book Alison sees the same Latin phrase on every page but Michael only sees English. When Alison writes the text Michael takes it to Professor Ruzinsky (Martin Balsam) who reports that it is a passage from Milton's Paradise Lost.Alison returns to the church and meets the rector who tells her he does not know of the priest she claims to have met there earlier. Meanwhile Michael visits Monsignor Franchino under the pretense that he has a bequest for Father Halliran. Franchino tells him that Halliran has been retired since 1952 suffers from palsy and is unable to accept visitors. Michael shows Franchino the excerpt from Milton but the monsignor claims not to recognize it. Franchino refuses Michael's request to make a copy of Father Halliran's file. That night Michael asks Alison's friend Jennifer (Deborah Raffin) to stay with her while he attends to business.Michael meets a man named Perry (William Hickey) an ex-convict that he represented in the past and bribes him some cash to assist with breaking into the diocese to look at the official files on Halliran. Michael discovers that Father Halliran was originally named Daniel O'Rourke and after a suicide attempt disappeared and re-emerged as Halliran. Michael finds files on several more people who attempted suicide gained new identities and became priests or nuns and all have lived and died in the very same apartment building in Brooklyn where Alison lives. When one dies another takes his or her place. A file for Alison states that Halliran will die the very next day and Alison will become a woman named Sister Theresa.Meanwhile detectives Gatz and Rizzo determine that the eight people Alison claims were at the birthday party for the cat were murderers executed long ago.Michael has Alison attend a party at Jennifer's while he investigates the apartment in Brooklyn Heights. At the party Alison faints and her friends put her to bed but at midnight she sneaks away. In Brooklyn Heights Michael discovers a hidden portal behind a wooden wall of the building which reads: ""Through me you go into the city of grief. Through me you go into the world of pain. Through me you walk among people lost. Abandon hope all yee who enter here"". Father Halliran appears and tells him that this whole building is the entrance to Hell. Michael pursues the priest upstairs and demands answers as he attempts to strangle him.Alison arrives at the building and is met by Michael who calmly explains that the Latin they found was a warning from the angel Gabriel to the angel Uriel stationed at the Gateway to Eden. Since that time a series of sentinels have stood watch guarding the world against evil. Currently it is Father Halliran but that night Alison is to become the next sentinel upon his passing. The people Alison met in the building the murderers were actually reincarnated devils who could only stop her from becoming the next sentinel by driving her to suicide. Michael goes on to explain that he is dead killed by Monsignor Franchino minutes earlier for trying to strangle Halliran. He is damned to eternal hell for his sins including hiring Brenner to murder his wife Karen. Michael turns his head revealing a gaping wound and his head splits open.Alison flees downstairs where Chazen and the demons confront her. She returns upstairs and sees Gerde and Sandra feasting on Michael's dead body. Just then all of the demons of hell come forth from behind doors and walls. Among the demons Alison sees her father and Chazen. Cornered by the deformed and hideous demons in Halliran's apartment Chazen approaches Alison and urges her to join them by killing herself; he gives her a dagger. Franchino and Halliran appear bearing a cross and drive back the demons. Chazen exhorts the demons to fight but Alison takes the cross. The devils fade back into the walls and the monsignor leads Father Halliran away.The next morning Gatz and Rizzo arrive at the apartment building where Father Halliran is carried out of the building in a body bag with the medical examiner's report that he just died of a heart attack. A search of the building leads to no other people around. The building is later demolished.Some time later Miss Logan the real estate agent who is still working for the shadowy priesthood in protecting the new apartment building shows a young couple (Tom Berenger and Nana Tucker) an apartment in the new building. They ask about the neighbors and are told that there are only two: one is a musician and the other is a reclusive blind nun who lives on the top floor. In that apartment the blind Alison now known as Sister Theresa sits silently wearing a white habit and staring blankly out the window holding the cross... now the new sentinel and protector of the entrance to Hell."

"Watching the sun sink below the Pacific horizon is the closest that
Zero [John Savage] can come to making himself feel almost human again...and this is only
after 1000 years of slowly acclimatizing himself to small amounts of
sunlight to build up his resistance. Zero is a vampire. He lives with his
""family"" -- two female vampires Alko [Marriam Parris] and Laura [Diana Frank] and a green-haired
vampire dwarf they call Kiddo [Michael J. Anderson].Watching the sun sink below the Pacific horizon is the closest that
Corri [Starr Andreeff] can come to clearing her mind of the thoughts that haunt her. Corri
is not a vampire but she lives the vampire lifestyle sleeping days and
turning tricks at night as an exotic dancer at an underground nightclub
called Club Vampire. [The doorway is framed by a huge vampire head.
Patrons walk in through the fanged mouth.] Both Zero and Corri are bored
with their lives which are about to merge.After accepting a few bucks to have sex with Laura on the floor at
the club Corri winds up cut up and dead. Unfortunately for Corri Laura
inadvertently dribbled some blood into Corri's mouth during their
encounter but Zero stops her from finishing Corri off. Corri is now on
the path to becoming a vampire. Corri awakens the next morning and finds
herself in sad shape but she manages to make it home to the condo she
shares with her young son Max [Ross Malinger] who makes it very clear that he would
rather his mother work at the mall selling 1000 shades of pink nail
polish than continue working her disgusting job at the club. She begins
exhibiting increased strength while also suffering from severe stomach
cramps. Although she used to be a vegetarian Corri attempts to feed her
growing hunger by eating raw meat from the grocery store. When she almost
bites her own son but gobbles up his pet hamster instead Corri realizes
that something is wrong.When Laura finds out that Corri is alive and beginning the turn she
tells Alko who orders Zero to find and destroy Corri as they want no more
additions to the family. Zero goes to Corri's apartment to do the deed but
finds her throwing up her intestines and ultimately offers to help her
through the change. He takes her to a motel and brings her a gothgirl
hooker to feed on. He explains that his family is after her and him too
because he refused to obey orders to kill ""the accident.""When Laura Alko and Kiddo learn that Corri is still alive they
ambush Zero and Corri in an alley and attempt to kill them both. Zero wins
the fight so the family agrees to let them live through the night. Zero
tries to convince Corri to hide out with him in Nepal for a few hundred
years but Corri refuses to abandon Max. She goes to the club and asks her
friend Melanie [Viktoria Chapman] to get Max and hide him. On the way to Corri's place
however Melanie makes the mistake of picking up a seemingly lost and
abandoned young girl and her little brother who turn out to be Alko and
Kiddo. They are joined by Laura and together they force Corri's address
out of Melanie.Back at Club Vampire Corri and Zero have taken a short nap. When
they awaken Corri is horrified to see Melanie's severed head staring at
her. Although it is daylight Zero bundles himself up and hurries to
Corri's apartment taking shelter in a dark tunnel when he can no longer
stand the sun. After the sun has set Laura Alko and Kiddo pay Max a
visit. Zero attempts to stop them from harming Max but Alko severs Zero's
head leaving him for ""dead."" Back to Club Vampire they go Max in tow.

and position her in front of a window then the family sits back to await
the morning sun while listening to ""the barbecue"" philosophize about love
caring and the real meaning of ""family.""Meanwhile Zero's head which the family thoughtlessly left laying on
the floor has reattached itself to his body. Zero hurries back to Club

slaps Max across the room but it is too late. Corri is free and she's

"Franco Arno (Karl Malden) a middle-aged blind man is walking down a street at night with his niece Lori (Cinzia De Carolis) when they pass by a man in a car. Franco overhears him mention blackmail. Franco bends over feigning tying his shoes and asks Lori to describe the man in the parked car. Lori does but says that she cannot see the other man clearly. They walk back to Franco's apartment nearby and while Lori sleeps Franco works on a puzzle when he hears a noise. Outside the unseen man in the parked car gets out and knocks out a night watchman by the gate of a large medical complex that stands right next to the apartment building where Franco lives. The unseen man uses a screwdriver to get inside the building goes to Dr. Calabresi's office unlocks it and gets inside. A doctor preparing to leave for the night sees the nightwatchman unconsicious and sees a dark figure running away.The next day the police arrive at the Terzi Institute investigating the break-in. Carlo Giordani (James Franciscus) arrives and bumps into Franco outside the institute and helps the blind man up. Carlo introduces himself and says that he's a reporter investigating the break-in. Inside Carlo learns that nothing was stolen from the institute. Professor Terzi (Tino Carraro) tells the officers that since nothing is missing he would rather not reveal the institutes research. Dr. Casoni (Aldo Reggiani) suggests that pictures may have been taken but Dr. Braun (Horst Frank) says to let the cops handle the matter. Meanwhile Dr. Calabresi (Carlo Alighiero) (the same man from the car who Franco overheard) looks at his files in his office and phones someone and agrees to meet with him. Calabresi tells his fiancee Bianca Merusi (Rada Rassimov) that he knows who broke into the institute and what was taken but he does not wish to tell anyone yet saying it could mean a ""big step forward"". At a local train station while a group of reporters are waiting for an celebrity starlet to arrive from an arriving train the unseen man approaches Calabresi and pushes him as the train arrives.The next day Frano and Lori are at home when Lori reads the newspaper for Frano about the ""accidental death"" of Dr. Calabresi and she tells Franco that the man in the newspaper is the same man she saw in the car the night before. She describes the picture and says that Carlo Giordani wrote the article. The two of them go to see the reporter at the newspaper office and Franco asks if the picture has been cropped. Carlo calls Righetto (Vittorio Congia) the paparazzi photographer who snapped the picture at the last second and he goes back to the orginal and sees a moving hand-arm in the far left of the frame. As Righetto prepares to print the photograph he is strangled to death with a cord. The unseen killer takes the photo and all the negatives and leaves just seconds before Carlo Franco and Lori arrive. Carlo goes inside the apartment and finds the body. Carlo sends Franco and Lori away and calls the police. The investigating officer Spimi (Pier Paolo Capponi) asks questions to Carlo about the ""maniac"". Later Carlo looks through a pair of binoculars at the people leaving the Terzi Institute and describes the doctors to Franco as they leave whom are Mombell Esson Casoni and Braun as well as Terzi and his daughter Anna (Catherine Spaak).Carlo goes to the Terzi home and he expresses his desire to talk about Calabresi's ""accident"". Afterwards Carlo speaks with Anna and he evades her questions of what he and her father spoke about. The two of them drive away together and Anna drives in full speed to evade a car with two detectives following them. Meanwhile Franco and Lori go to talk with Bianca and she says apologetically that she could not find anything in the house relating to her fiances death. After they leave Franco asks Lori what he kept hearing while they were talking and Lori says it was a chain and locket around her neck and that Bianca was fidgeting with it.Elsewhere Carlo and Anna talk over drinks at a local restaurant where she tells them about the institute's research of ""chromosome alteration"" and ""XYY"" the extra Y producing a ""criminal tendency"" in a person. Carlo then goes to see Dr. Braun at the St Peter's Club and he talks to the doctor about someone being after the institute's secret drug. Braun does not seem vexed.Bianca takes a taxi to Calabresi's parked car in a lot. Inside she finds a tiny note with an appointment time at the station (and an unseen name) written down. She tapes the note to the inside of her locket. Bianca then calls Franco and says she knows who killed Calabresi but she will only tell him in person. As Bianca walks down the hallway of her apartment building to return to her apartment the unseen killer attacks and strangles her with a cord. The killer rummages through her purse but does not find anything.Franco shows Carlo a note he received in which the killer threatens the ""puzzle solver"" and the ""journalist"" or more people will die. Carlo talks to Franco that he found out that two of the doctors Casoni being fired from his last job and Braun having received a lot of money. Carlo goes to see Casoni and the doctor talks about the institute's ""wonder drug"" and the ""XYY pattern"". Carlo then asks Dr. Mombell about XYY and the doctor says that everyone in the institute was tested but their results are confidential.The unseen killer approaches Carlo's front door and injects two milk cartons dropped off by the local milkman with a syringe. A little later Carlo arrives home and brings the milk cartons inside. Anna arrives shortly thereafter and they talk about more about the research and of her results of the XYY test. Their talk leads to a kiss and they end up having sex. Afterwards Carlo pours himself and Anna a glass of milk from one of the cartons when Franco phones saying that someone tampered with the gas line on his stove flooding his apartment with methane gas and also may try to kill Carlo. Carlo notices the milk that had bled from the cartons from the hypodermic needle holes and knocks the glass away from Anna before she can drink it. Carlo smells and tastes the milk and deduces that it has been poisoned.The following day Carlo meets with one of his old friends and informants named Gigi the Loser (Ugo Fangareggi) (so-named since he spent time in prison) for help in investigating the Terzi break-in which may have been an inside job. Carlo and Gigi break into Terzi's house and discover that Anna is adopted and (via a diary) that Terzi apparently ""adored"" the woman. Carlo then goes to the police station and learns from Spimi that Bianca often met with Braun and that the cops cannot find the doctor. Carlo then runs a story in the newspaper about Braun being a suspect in the break-in and a former gay lover of Manuel approaches Carlo and tells him where Braun is hiding. Carlo goes over to the apartment where he is attacked by Manuel (Braun's new lover). Carlo wins the fight and sees Braun lying dead on the couch. But the police conclude that Manuel had nothing to do with the break-in and that he murdered Braun out of a jealous rage.A few days later Franco contacts Carlo where he recalls Bianca's locket and suggests that the note that she found of the killer's name might still be there. Franco and Carlo head to the cemetery and open Bianca's family crypt. Carlo gets her coffin open while Franco waits by the door. Carlo finds the locket that was buried with Bianca opens it and discovers the note behind a metal plate and hands it to Franco. As Carlo closes the coffin Franco shuts the crypt door locking Carlo in. After spending a few minutes in the dark crypt Franco opens the door again and walks inside without his dark sunglasses with a bruise on his face and a large blade protruding from his walking cane that's speared with blood. Franco tells the reporter that he was attacked outside by the killer who told him that he has Lori as a captive and was forced to give him the note. But Franco tells him that he managed to stab the killer with his cane. Meanwhile Lori is hit on the head and put in the back of a car. Franco and Carlo find the taxi (which the killer and Lori rode in) and discover blood in the back seat. The unseen killer then calls Franco and tells him that he will hold Lori for a while and to stop investigating the break in and the murders.Carlo goes to the police to report the kidnapping and they go to the Terzi house and Anna comes down the stairs with cloth wrapped around her hand. Carlo tells her about the father-daughter ""relationship"" that he knows about and expresses suspicion about the milk incident (Anna had the glass of poisoned milk for some time without drinking it). But Anna claims that she only cut her hand on a broken vase and was nowhere near the cemetery which was just a few hours ago. She is irate that Carlo suspects her of being the killer. But with little evidence to arrest her Carlo and the others leave.Carlo and the police arrive at the Terzi Institute and search the place for Lori whom Carlo suspects that the killer is one of the doctors but they find nothing. As Carlo walks on a stairwell he finds blood on his collar and he thinks back to the room he just came from. He returns to the room and sees blood dripping from the ceiling. He climbs up to the roof and chases an unseen person. Then the unseen person turns around and it is Casoni who hits him in the face and kicks Carlo to the ground. Casoni with a stab wound to his stomach goes to a back room where a gagged Lori is and prepares to stab her. Carlo runs in and tackles the killer but gets stabbed in the chest. Just then the police arrive on the roof and chase Casoni but he gets caught by Franco who stops him with his cane blade. Franco asks about Lori and Casoni (deranged to the last) tells Franco that he killed her. Enraged Franco swings his cane at Casoni who tries to run and pushes the deranged doctor through a sky window and he falls down an elevator shaft to his death just as Lori calls out for Franco.

"""Nightmare""The movie begins with a scene showing a sleeping girl being menaced by a female vampire in her bedroom. The dream is abandoned when the sleeping girl wakes up screaming in the front seat of her father's forest green Jeep Cherokee. She then tells her father that she has had ""the same dream again"".""Speeding Crash""Jenny and her father Travis who is at the helm of their forest green Jeep Cherokee are driving at a steady 5 miles per hour to an undisclosed location. Suddenly there is an incident. Jenny yells out ""DAD!"" as the jeep proceeds to plow over a zombie dressed up like a roadside construction worker. The zombie's head goes flying skyward immediately following the impact though its body still shows a head visibly attached. The audience is then treated to a techno rave ballad as the jeep fades from view and the beginning credits roll.""Zombie Hell""A radio news reporter describes a recent and horrific epidemic of zombiedom that has swept the calm countryside of the once peaceful set of woods with one road and a gas station. The reports indicate that a symptom of said outbreak is ""murder"". They then pull up beside a stalled car with three occupants: an older woman and two younger women- one of whom is bound and gagged. Ignoring the bound and gagged girl Travis gives the other girl a lift. This girl is a vampire named Carmilla or possibly not. This is followed by a very long sequence at a roadside gas-station in which a strange woman in Gothic make-up (possibly a witch or sorceress) hands them a necklace.""Checking into the Madhouse""As the gas-station attendant (producer Rob Carpenter) gets sucked into an orgy of violence at the hands of vampires/zombies Travis his daughter Jenny and Carmilla drive off only to break down further down the road.

He lets Jenny and Carmilla steal the Land Rover. As Travis drives ahead in the jeep Carmilla and Jenny indulge in lesbian sex in the commandeered Land Rover. The destination is the original crypt Carmilla had been buried in. Flashbacks of a madhouse emerge where Carmilla is revealed to be a nurse and Jenny her insane patient. Later they make their way to the crypt where they encounter more zombies/vampires. After the true reality of the situation is revealed they check into a motel. Bright-red stage blood flows in these gory and surreal scenes which could be delusional or possibly flash-backs. There is also a vampire-hunter known as 'The General' who may be pursuing them or possibly arranging a rendezvous due to his daughter being kidnapped by a female colleague of Carmilla.The film ends with a spinning book and the words ""The End""."

"NOTE: Sequel to Dracula 2000. It is not crucial but it helps to have first seen Dracula 2000 if
only to know Dracula's lineage and how he was left burned and hanging from a lighted crucifix.Father Uffizi [Jason Scott Lee] hunts vampires. He travels the world to behead them
with his bullwhip but his ultimate goal is to find the first vampire Dracula (revealed as Judas Iscariot in Dracula 2000) absolve Dracula's
sins against Jesus set his soul free and end his unholy existence.
So when Dracula's charred body turns up in the New Orleans morgue
Uffizi heads there. Medical students Liz Blaine [Diane Neal] and Luke [Jason London] are charged with
autopsying the body. When they open the abdominal cavity they find that
the liver and other organs are white suggesting to Luke that the person
did not produce his own blood but got it elsewhere i.e. a vampire. Not
believing Liz searches the mouth for fangs which suddenly erupt and stab
her finger. Then comes a phone call offering them $30 million for the
body. They decide to switch the vampire with another burn victim keep the
$30 million and hide the vampire's body in order to study it. Liz and
Luke accompanied by two other med students Kenny [Khary Payton] and Tanya [Brande Roderick] transport
the vampire's body to the abandoned home of Professor Lowell [Craig Sheffer] who
is also Liz's lover and who is confined to a wheelchair because of
cerebral palsy.They're not quite sure how they're going to research this vampire
but the first thing on the agenda is to immerse him in 350 pints of blood
to allow his body to heal. After two hours without a ripple they decide
to fish out the body to see if anything is happening. Just then the
vampire [Stephen Billington] sits up busts his way out of the tub and kills Tanya in the
process. As Luke prepares to stake the very angry vampire Eric [John Light] enters
with a 'sungun' and subdues the vampire. Eric introduces himself as ""the
money."" After the vampire is secured and Tanya is buried they move the
vampire to an abandoned gym where a testing room has been set up with
ultraviolet lights and a table to which the vampire can be secured with
chains coated in liquid silver. The plan is to find the vampire's essence
and make from it a vaccine that can be used to cure diseased cells.The first experiment involves placing a drop of human blood on a
sample of skin taken from the vampire. The skin quickly grows ""like a
cancer but without the chaos."" Next a syringeful of blood is drawn from
the vampire's neck and a drop of the vampire's blood is placed on a
tissue sample from Lowell's wasted muscle. The vampire blood cells
immediately begin killing off the human cells. ""If it's replacing the
cells that it has killed when do you stop being you?"" Liz wonders. Luke squirts
the changing tissue with holy water and it immediately begins to sizzle
as though acid had been poured on it. Now ""the trick is to separate the
diseased vector--the evil if you will--from the cure"" says Lowell.But Kenny can't wait. He injects the remainder of the vampire's blood
into himself. Of course he turns into a vampire. Eric Liz and Luke go
looking for him. In their absence the vampire mesmerizes Lowell into
driving his wheelchair off a ledge. When Liz and Luke return they find
Lowell badly injured. Meanwhile Liz has been noticing that her vampire
bite is infected and that the infection is spreading throughout her body.
Yet she is still committed to the research because of her love for
Lowell. Finding a cure for him is of tantamount importance. Liz reveals to
Luke the extent of her infection and pleads with him to help.But the vampire's blood supply has been depleted. Liz decides to
transfuse some of her own blood into the vampire so that she can get more
blood from him. She injects this blood into Lowell who immediately begins
to heal. Lowell then laughs at Liz and tells her that he was only using
her along with four others to find a vampire. He says that he never
loved Liz and that he is ""the money"" behind the whole project. In a fit of
""jilted bitch"" Liz tosses holy water on him.To protect themselves Luke has sprinkled seeds around the vampire
and placed a knotted net on his chest. In the melee that ensues Lowell
becomes a vampire and Dracula breaks free from his bindings. First
Dracula bites off Eric's face. Then he turns on Luke and Liz. Luke reminds him that he must untie all the knots but
Dracula tosses down a knotfree net. [Already done!] Luke reminds him that
he must count all the seeds and Dracula replies ""47812."" Luke tosses a
bucket of seeds at him and challenges ""Count these!"" Before the seeds
even hit the ground Dracula says ""737818."" When one more seed falls
from the basket Dracula amends his count to ""...19.""Fortunately Father Uffizi has managed to destroy Tanya Kenny and
all the other vampires left in the wake. He now catches up with Dracula.
Liz is turning too. Uffizi tells Luke to take her out into the sun but
Liz is too far gone. In an attempt to kill Dracula Uffizi smashes all the
windows to let in the sunlight. He wraps his whip around Dracula's neck
and is just about to behead him when Dracula forces upon him a vision of
Christ blinding Uffizi for a moment. In that moment Liz shoots Uffizi.
As Dracula escapes with Liz Uffizi promises ""I'll find you."" Dracula replies ""I'm counting on it."" [Original synopsis by bj_kuehl]"

"Late one night in December a young boy named Derek Quinn (William Thorne) hears the doorbell ring and goes downstairs and finds a Christmas present addressed to him on the porch.

Finding a musical orb shaped like Santa Claus in the box he activates it causing it to strangle him with retractable cords; as Tom struggles he slips and falls onto a fireplace poker his impaled body being found by his wife Sarah (Jane Higginson) a few moments later.Two weeks later Sarah takes Derek who hasn't spoken since his father's death to a toy store owned by the elderly Joe Petto (Mickey Rooney) and his odd son Pino (Brian Bremer) not realizing they have been followed by Noah Adams (Tracy Fraim). After Derek rejects all the toys Joe shows him (and one called Larry the Larvae that Pino tries to give him) he and his mother leave prompting Joe to begin angrily yelling at Pino belittling him and blaming him for all the store's recent failures. While running from his father Pino bumps into Noah and drops the larvae toy which Noah picks up and buys along with some other toys. At his home Noah begins taking apart the toys he bought from Joe when he is confronted by his angry landlord Harold (Gerry Black). Late paying rent Noah to smooth things over gives Harold the Larry the Larvae toy in exchange for a one day extension. While driving home Harold is killed when Larry the Larvae crawls into his mouth and bursts out his eye causing his car to crash and explode.The next day Sarah takes Derek to see Santa (portrayed by Noah who takes his friend's shift) at the mall finding another gift on the porch on the way out. While Sarah and Derek are gone Pino sneaks into their house using a key he had hidden years earlier when he and his father lived there. When Sarah and Derek get home early (due to Noah's odd behavior towards Derek) Pino flees from the house. After confronting Joe about Pino's intrusion (and stating that she will call the police the next time it happens) Sarah decides to let Derek open the present dropped off earlier but Derek refuses to touch it. Leaving Derek alone Sarah is visited by her friend Kim Levitt (Neith Hunter) and while the two talk Derek sneaks outside and throws the present in a garbage can where Kim's adopted son Lonnie (Conan Yuzna) finds it. While Lonnie unwraps the gift and finds roller skates in it. Joe in a drunken rage begins beating Pino accidentally killing him by knocking him down some stairs. While using the skates Lonnie is hit by a car and left hospitalized when rockets hidden within the skates cause him to lose control.While Sarah visits Lonnie and Kim at the hospital Derek is visited by Noah who is shooed away by the babysitter Meredith (Amy L. Taylor) who tells Noah where to find Sarah when Noah keeps badgering her from outside. In the parking garage of Sarah's workplace Noah revealed to be Sarah's old boyfriend and Derek's real father confronts her and the two reconcile. At the Quinn house Meredith and her boyfriend Buck (Eric Welch) engage in some freaky sex involving a toy hand on his butt a toy that is left by Joe who is dressed as Santa. Joe who had broken into the home has a horde of toys attack them while he abducts Derek taking him to the toy store. Shortly before taking Sarah home Noah tells her about Joe's past saying he was arrested years earlier for booby trapping toys he gave to children after his pregnant wife died in a car crash; pulling into the driveway Sarah and Noah find the hysterical and bloody Meredith who tells them Buck is dead (having had his head cut off by a circular saws attached to a toy car) and that Joe took Derek.Sarah rushes to the toy store (followed by Noah) and starts looking around upstairs arming herself with a knife. In the basement Noah is attacked by Joe with a remote control plane and an acid squirting water pistol and is knocked out. Hearing the noise Sarah goes downstairs finds the real Joe's dead body and tries to run only to be stopped by the Joe dressed as Santa. The imposter Joe removes his face (showing robotic components underneath) and puts on another revealing himself to be Pino. Pino explains to Sarah that Joe created him to replace his own dead son but he could never live up to his father's expectations (as he was not ""a real son"") and was continually broken and rebuilt by Joe in his drunken rages. Pino goes on to say that he wants Sarah to be his mother (sending killer toys to try to kill Derek) before beginning to dry hump her while frantically screaming ""I love you mommy!""Sarah manages to stab Pino in the head with a screwdriver causing him to begin malfunctioning. Grabbing the knife Sarah dropped earlier Pino begins trying to stab Derek who he had placed in a large sack. Derek is saved when Noah breaks into the room and starts fighting Pino distracting him long enough for Sarah to halve him at the waist with an axe. Barely functioning Pino cries for his father before grabbing Sarah's leg causing her to stomp his head into pieces. As Sarah Derek and Noah leave the eyes of a one of Joe's partially assembled robots spark ominously like Pino's and his creations.(Note: Clint Howard and Neith Hunter reprise their characters of Ricky and Kim for 'The Toy Maker' although both only make minor appearances.

Just prior to the beating Morlar's eyes look right into the attacker's and he calmly says ""a response at last"".An investigation into the beating death has the detectives shocked to find that Morlar has survived barely and they rush him to the hospital. He has his head totally bandaged (except for eyes and nose) and is plugged into multiple machines and monitors hoses tubes etc. Obviously he is in the ICU and here he stays for the rest of the movie.We follow the detectives' investigation into the beating at Morlar's apartment; how he lives gets along with neighbors his traits; his artwork furnishings his writings etc. His writings are cryptic obscure dark and ominous dealing with many past catastrophies and disasters. The detectives find that Morlar had been seeing a psychologist.They find the psychologist Dr. Zonfeld (Lee Remmick) and try to discover what's up with Morlar. They find that he felt like he had some kind of power to create catastrophe. Zonfeld doesn't give much to the detectives other than to state he was delusional so they go back to the apartment and hospital to dig up some more info.Morlar's hand trembles and he's given a pencil...he writes a warning about the old cathedral wall which had been cracking lately causing much worry about a collapse. Detectives think there is more to learn from Zonfeld.From this next visit to Zonfeld the story is told through flashbacks from Zonfeld's and Morlar's points of view while she was interviewing analyzing Morlar. She reveals that he felt he had caused the deaths of many people that had wronged him in the past. His nanny his parents his school professor his estranged wife and her boyfriend. He felt that he learned that he could cause almost any type of catastrophe. She still claimed to the detectives that she felt it was all in his head a delusion. She seems disinterested in his case and makes the police feel that there was no worry from her about the validity of his claims.Morlar's almost flatline brain activity ocasiionally gets a blip or two when his hand wants to warn of the collapse of the wall so the detectives really watch him close. A bit more pressure on Zonfeld and she accompanies the police to the hospital. Seing Morlar causes her to confess that Morlar's claims had begun to seem possible and he had actually gotten her to come to his apartment. She witnessed him stare at the airliner as it took off and watched it fly straight into the city center as he stared it to it's death.The detective believes now that Zonfeld has more to do with this and goes back to her place the next day to find her dead from a self-induced injection. She left a taped confession that she had tried to kill him to prevent the space disaster but had failed. She has now convinced the detective that Morlar could cause these disasters.As police watch morlar in the hospital the cathedral wall begins to crumble just as the Queen is arriving for a visit. Police rush all around trying to prevent death and destruction but only our detective knows what is the cause. He rushes back to the hospital to remove the life support from Morlar. As Morlar's little jiggles and wiggles on the brain monitor fade the falling cathedral catastrophe wanes and we sigh relief that it has all ended.The police look at Morlar's flatlined body and are about to leave when the EEG monitor begins to make creepy squeaky sounds and the flatline becomes very active. Then we look at Morlar's bandaged face as his intense eyes open wide."

"A teacher vs student basketball game. Sally Donnelly (Catherine Baranova) asks Dr Michael ""Mike"" Foster (Harry Cason) why Dr Peter Houseman (Gene Le Brock) gets such a huge grant money. Houseman is one of the people playing. He is an attractive man who looks at Sally at recess. Mike says that he is a brilliant scientist. During his lesson he speaks about the 3-million alphabet within the human DNA structure. Hoffman complains that his funds have been taken away because he refuses to publish his findings.

"Writer David Norliss [Roy Thinnes] who has been working on a book debunking the
supernatural hasn't been seen or heard from in over a week so his
publisher Sanford T Evans [Don Porter] pays a visit to David's house in San
Francisco. David is not there but Sanford does find the first page of his
manuscript in the typewriter and a pile of tapes on his desk. Sanford pops
the tape marked ""1"" into the recorder and begins to listen to the story
about how David became involved with the widow of sculptor James Cort and
the strange events that subsequently took place.On the recommendation of her sister Marsha Sterns [Michele Carey] Ellen Cort [Angie Dickinson] contacted
David Norliss the day after a terrifying incident in which she came upon
her dead husband James [Nick Dimitri] in his studio. What he was doing she didn't know but
she did watch him easily kill their German shepherd as if batting at a
fly. She shot him but the police could not find his body nor any of his
blood and Sheriff Hartley [Claude Akins] refuses to believe it was her husband. However
Ellen is certain about what she saw and thinks it may involve the occult.
She explains to David how when her husband learned that he had incurable
Pick's disease he made a deal with an occultist named Madame Jeckiel [Vonetta McGee] who
claimed to be able to cure illness and even grant immortality. To seal the
deal Jeckiel gave James a ring holding the Osiris scarab. Ellen has no
idea what the agreement involved but she did see to it that her husband
was buried with the ring on his finger as per his request.That night a young woman is murdered in Carmel near Ellen's house.
The autopsy reveals that her body was totally drained of blood. Sheriff
Hartley warns everyone involved not to talk about it but by the time
David makes it down to Carmel the whole town seems to be a-buzz. David
visits Mme Jeckiel who warns him to stay away from Cort's studio in fact
his entire estate ""because it is now the House of Sargoth"". Of course
the first thing David does is go snooping in the studio. Everything seems
to be in order until he and Ellen notice a statue that wasn't there
before. It's a statue of a demon and it appears to be a work in progress.
Even the clay is still damp so David takes a sample of it for analysis.Suddenly James Cort bursts through the door and leaps at them. David
and Ellen attempt to get away but Cort pursues them to the car. David
gets the car going just as Cort rips off the passenger door but they
succeed in escaping. David drives straight to the police station where
they show the car to Sheriff Hartley who agrees to accompany them back to
the Cort estate and search for Cort. When they find Cort's coffin empty
Hartley concludes that someone has taken the body but recommends that
Ellen move to a motel in Carmel for her own safety. That night Ellen's sister Marsha returns from a trip to New York and finding no one at the estate takes a room at a nearby motel. As
she's getting ready for bed James Cort crashes through a window and
attacks her. When the motel manager knocks on the door to see why she's
screaming he is knocked sideways by Cort barreling out of the room with
Marsha in his arms. The manager calls the sheriff who gives him the same
warning not to talk about what happened until they can find Marsha.The next day David telephones Ellen with the news that he's located
blueprints of the studio and discovered underground tunnels where he
thinks Cort may be hiding. He's also gotten back the chemical analysis of
the clay and learned that it is 40% human blood. He presumes that Cort is
killing people and using their blood in the clay but for what purpose?
While David drives to Carmel Ellen is visited by Mme Jeckiel who tells
her about the deal with her husband. In return for the Osiris scarab
which allows him to rise from dead Cort must sculpt a statue of the demon
Sargoth. When finished the statue will provide a material body for
Sargoth. Jeckiel means to find Cort's body before nightfall and remove the
ring from his finger thus preventing Sargoth from entering this world.
Ellen leaves a note for David at her motel and she and Jeckiel go to the
studio to search for Cort in the tunnels.It is almost sundown when Ellen and Jeckiel find Cort's body lying in
a coffin. Jeckiel attempts to remove the ring from his finger but Cort
suddenly awakens and kills her. In running away Ellen stumbles on
Marsha's body. Just then David catches up with Ellen and they head for
the studio where they find that the statue is almost completed. David
pulls out a beaker of blood and pours a circle around the statue
explaining that medieval alchemy says that a blood circle on fire will
prevent anything from getting out of the circle.Just as David completes the blood circle they hear a sound. They
hide as Cort enters the studio. He goes directly to the statue and
completes it then drops on his knees and chants. Just as the statue of
Sargoth comes to life David lights the blood circle trapping both Cort
and Sargoth [Bob Schott] inside. The studio goes up in flames. Later when Sheriff
Hartley has the ashes searched only James Cort's bones are found. Of the
demon Sargoth they find nothing.Tape 1 has come to a finish. Sanford places tape 2 into the recorder
and asks himself whether this tape will tell what happened to both Sargoth
and David Norliss. It begins ""It was a rainy afternoon when I received
the letter..."" [Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl.]"

They disregard it but Yoko dies at that exact moment of the call. She was speaking with Yumi on the phone and the last things that Yimi can hear are "" ""It's beginning to rain"" and then the scream.The following day Yumi overhears a group of students talking about an urban legend about people receive phone calls with date and time of their death in the near future. Yumi seeks out Kioto's boyfriend Kenji Kawai (Atsushi Ida) who also received a call and witnesses his death. He had believed her on the last moment but an invisible energy pulls him into the lift shaft.When her roommate Natsumi Konishi (Kazue Fukiishi) receives a call Yoko befriends Hiroshi Yamashita (Shin'ichi Tsutsumi) who tells her that his sister Ritsuko Yamashita (Azusa) was the first victim of the phone call. While in the hospital Yumi hears an asthma pump and recalls that she heard the same noise when Kenji died. They decide to investigate victims of asthma in the hospital and find the name of Marie Mizunuma (Mariko Tsutsui) and her children Mimiko and Nanako. Both are thought to have been brutalised by her mother who suffered from Muchhusen Syndrome an illness which makes parents injure their children in order to save them right away. Parents who suffer this syndrome seek prise and attention from other adults and they want to be considered as good care-providers. They search the family together trying to save Natsumi from her fate.A para-normal journalist contacts Natsumi. He finally convinces the terrified teenager to get an exorcism in live TV. Natsumi agrees. However the tv programme goes terribly awry. Although people can't see it with their eyes screen monitors show a womanly shape crawling horizontally from one of the walls. Natsumi has a deeply painful death all the bones in her body being twisted. At the same time a voice tells her ""Don't worrywe'll take you to hospital.""

The presence of the ghost hauts her there showing her dead fetoes in crystal jars. Yumi finds Marie's burnt-to-deat body holding a mobile phone. The corpse attacks her. Hiroshi tries to save her but he's thrown out of the room. The corpse won't hurt Yumi when she repents from some little fault.Hiroshi investigates further and they find out that Marie didn't her her children. It's Mimiko who used to hurt Nanako on purpose. After hurting Nanako Mimiko always gave her her favourite sweet so that Nanako doesn't betray her. When Marie finds it out she takes Nanako to hospital leaving Mimiko all by herself in spite of suffering an asthma attack at that moment. Mimiko dies. He runs to warn Yumi. She's at her flat taking a shower. She doesn't realise that clocks are turning anti-clockwise so that she'll be killed at the time set by Mimiko's ghost.My interpretation of the ending is that Mimiko has killed Yumi. Disguised as Yumi Mimiko's ghost stabs Hiroshi once. He's taken to hospital. Still on the form of Yumi Mimiko french-kisses him and puts a sweet on his mouth.

Much to everyone's surprise Madame Irina is successful. Aleric appears and informs them that his body is buried in the cloisters and his head is in a crypt in the monastery both on Hugo's land near the mountain village of Lechat. So Hugo Maurice Sylvia and Paula decide to make the trip in order to see if they can find Aleric's remains. While driving in the mountains they are tricked into stopping their car to help a man lying wounded in the road. The man turns out to be an escaped criminal and he and his friend are looking for a car in which to get away. Unfortunately they don't get very far before they drive the car head on into the mountainside and destroy the radiator. Luckily some locals come along shoot the criminals and sell Hugo an old beat-up Citroen for 3000 francs so that they can continue on to Hugo's chalet.After arriving at the chalet and settling in the caretaker Gastone [Juan Cazalilla] along with two hired hands from the village takes Hugo and Maurice to the cloisters even though local rumor has it that strange things have happened there and that ""a demon walks about."" While digging in the yard where it is rumored that a treasure is buried Maurice suddenly gets a feeling and leads the group directly to the spot where they dig up a chest. Unable to get the chest open they take it back to the chalet. Later that night the two hired men sneak into the chalet and break open the chest only to find a piece of paper with the word ""Astarothe"" painted on it. When Gastone finds them raiding the chest one of the villagers Alain [Luis Ciges] picks up a handsickle and as though in a trance slays Gastone and the other villager. Hearing Gastone's cry his daughters Chantal [Maria Jos Cantudo] and Elvira [Emma Cohen] go looking for him. Finding their father dead the girls wake up Hugo. Hugo and Maurice go to help Gastone and notice that the chest is gone. In fact Alain has taken it into the monastery.When they realize that they are trapped in the chalet high in the mountains (no phone no lights no gasoline) with provisions for only four more days the villagers angry with them for stirring up the demons and a crazed murderer running about Hugo and Maurice go looking for a way to get down from the mountain. Meanwhile Alain starts picking off the girls. First to have her throat cut is Chantal but Alain doesn't stop there. He cuts out her heart too. Then he captures Paula and carries her off. Maurice goes looking for Paula and hears her calling him. When Maurice later returns to the chalet seemingly in a trance he slugs Sylvia and carries her body to where Aleric's head is alive and well. Aleric's head then tells Maurice to dig out his body as well as Mabille's. After reuniting Aleric's head with his body Maurice places Sylvia's body in Mabille's tomb. Aleric then slices open Sylvia's chest. As her blood mixes with Mabille's remains Mabille is reconstituted. Maurice then kills Alain cuts out his heart and presents it to Aleric and Mabille.Elvira and Hugo the only two left alive in the chalet go looking for a talisman that Gastone used to protect against demons. It appears to work because when Aleric comes to rip out Elvira's heart he is sent packing when he sees the talisman around her neck. Apparently it doesn't work against the living dead for when Hugo and Elvira are attacked during the night by the corpses of Gastone Chantal Sylvia and the dead thief Hugo and Elvira are forced to build a fire to keep them away. The next morning Maurice suddenly shows up explaining that he's been wandering about looking for Paula. Hugo asks Maurice to help him dig up and burn the corpses that attacked them last night but when they go looking for the bodies Maurice kills Hugo with a shotgun. Maurice then goes after Elvira but the spell over him is dissipated when he touches the talisman.Elvira and Maurice promise to destroy Aleric and Mabille. Meanwhile Mabille is getting hungry so she and Aleric attack some villagers and eat some more hearts. Seven moons have passed and Aleric and Mabille are preparing for a ritual which will return them to full power. While Paula lures Maurice and the talisman away from Elvira Aleric enters the chalet. Fortunately Maurice returns before Aleric has a chance to do anything to Elvira. As Maurice taunts Aleric with the talisman Mabille kills Paula and then goes after Elvira. Maurice tosses the talisman at Aleric setting him smoking as Aleric buries an ax in Maurice's chest. Elvira stabs Mabille with a silver needle. Elvira then picks up the talisman touches it to Aleric's forehead and Aleric's head separates from his body. Elvira burns all the bodies and tosses the talisman into the lake.

"A man walks into a church that is filled with worshipers all holding candles and staring at a sculpture at the front altar. He steps forward and observes a white statue of the Virgin Mary with two streams of red tears flowing out of its eyes. As another priest greets him you learn that the man is Father Andrew Kiernan an investigator sent from the Vatican to determine the validity of divine occurrences. The priest explains to Father Kiernan that the tears began flowing when Father Almedia died; his body still on display in a coffin to the side of the statue. While Father Kiernan takes pictures and samples of the liquid a small young boy steals the rosary wrapped around Father Almedia's hands in the coffin.In a local market the boy sells the rosary to an older white woman while a local stall vendor warns them that it isn't right to steal from the dead.In Pittsburg Frankie Paige (Patricia Arquette) lives a fast and free lifestyle working at a hair salon and partying with her friends at clubs.

Frankie gives the gifts a cursory look and stares at the rosary after she hangs up the phone. While examining the rosary she suddenly feels extremely nauseous and vomits.Meeting up with her friend before they head to work they both consider the possibility that Frankie is pregnant. After a day at the salon Frankie relaxes at home in a hot bath. Suddenly a dove flies frantically around her apartment and Frankie is suddenly thrown under the water in the bath struggling with an unseen force. Flashes between nails being driving into a man's wrist and wounds developing on Frankie's fill the screen.Her friend finds her at home in the bath with blood everywhere and rushes her to the hospital. While a surgeon attempts to sew up the two wounds she explains that they look like they were done by a single sharp object driven through her wrists. The staff believes they are self-inflicted though Frankie denies it.Back in Rome Father Kiernan comes back to give in his report about a Virgin Mary sighting in a wall in Brazil. He mentions the statue that he discovered but is quickly directed to drop the subject by the head priest. Frustrated the Father accepts the church's decision.Frankie and her friend are riding the subway home when Frankie suddenly stands up from her seat to confront a priest at the end of the car. She asks the man if he is Andrew and when he replies no she swears and suddenly the train runs wild. Passengers are thrown around the car while Frankie is now being whipped on the back by an unseen force. Finding herself again at the hospital enduring rigorous tests the doctors finally conclude that she may have a case of epilepsy. While leaving the hospital the priest from the subway meets her in the waiting room hands her his card and says that when she is up to talking to him he wants to ask her about ""stigmata.""News of Frankie's ""attacks"" have made the papers and the Vatican has decided to send Father Andrew Kiernan to Pittsburg and investigate the occurrences. He is told to quiet the situation and defuse any rumors of stigmata. Upon arrival there is an instant connection between himself and Frankie. They have a coffee at the diner while Father Andrew starts the interview. After Frankie explains that she isn't religious and doesn't even believe in God Father Andrew explains that what is happening cannot be stigmata as it only afflicts the extremely devout. After showing the wounds on her wrist that still haven't healed he looks confused but still does not relent. Frankie storms out frustrated that this glimmer of explanation and hope did not amount to anything.That night Frankie meets her friend at their usual club. She is clearly distressed - feeling that God is doing this to her and that she just wants everything to stop. After her friend tells her that she is losing it Frankie storms off only to be halted by another attack - this time scratches and slashes on her forehead. Bloody and hurt she runs from the club in the rain. She reaches her apartment door and sees Father Andrew ringing her bell. He sees her but Frankie runs. Father Andrew discovers her crouching on a car in an alleyway scratching symbols into the paint with a broken bottle. He walks towards her and Frankie stands up bellowing something in a foreign language in a man's voice. She collapses and Father Andrew carries her into her apartment. Father Andrew calls his friend in Rome and replays the phrase Frankie yelled - the friend explains that it is an ancient dialect of Aramaic - the language of Jesus."

"Titles and credits roll over a view of the United Nations General Assembly Building from the East River accompanied by a dramatic piano score. We open with brothers Dr. Henry Spensser (John Baragrey) and Dr. Jeremy Spensser (Ross Martin) watching an industrial film about factory automation. Sitting on his father's lap is Billy Spensser (Charles Herbert). Jeremy is credited in the film with inventing a heat-sensing device that has revolutionized efficiency in automation. They are interrupted by Jeremy's wife Anne Spensser (Mala Powers) who reads from a newspaper headline ""International Peace Prize Awarded to Jeremy Spensser."" Billy is unimpressed and impatient to see the rest of the movie. The brothers wax philosophical about world peace. Jeremy is convinced ""People of the world get enough to eat war might just become obsolete."" The family travels to Stockholm to collect the prize. They return to New York's Idlewild (now JFK) airport as reported in the New York newspaper. Jeremy's father the renowned brain surgeon Dr. William Spensser (Otto Kruger) is waiting at the airport to greet his family. The proud father is interviewed by the press. He introduces his son's friend Dr. John Robert Carrington (Robert Hutton). He explains to the reporters in reply to a question that the brain of a genius like his son Jeremy is no different in appearance to anyone else's. The family clears customs and joins those waiting outside. It is a blustery day and Billy manages to lose his toy airplane to a gust of wind. He asks his father to retrieve his toy. Distracted by his pursuit of the airplane Jeremy does not see an approaching truck and is struck and killed. Dr. Carrington pronounces him dead. An ambulance takes the body to the home of the senior Dr. Spensser. Anne remarks ""I don't understand."" Dr. John Carrington concurs ""Neither do I."" The ambulance crew departs the residence and Dr. Spensser locks himself in his lab. John tells Henry ""He was dead within five seconds."" Henry asks ""Then what's all this about an operation? What can he do?"" For three hours Dr. Spensser works on his son's body. He opens the lab door and tells his family ""I did I did all I could.""At Jeremy's funeral service his body is displayed in an open casket. He has bandages on his head. John presents the eulogy. Dr. Spensser angry and upset exits the service. He asks John if great brains unhampered by their bodies could have continued their work to better the human race. John counters that brain and body together are necessary to embody the soul. A brain deprived of a body devolves into a monster. Dr. Spensser almost divulges his secret regarding Jeremy but thinking better of it admits the discussion is theoretical. John tells Henry that Dr. Spensser will need support in the grieving of his son. Henry reveals his bitterness and sour relationship with his father ""That'll be something new. He's always needed Jeremy before."" Gazing out the window at the arrival of Anne and Billy Henry agrees to John's request for him to stay and support his father. His real reason for staying will become apparent later.It has been four months since Jeremy's untimely death and Henry expresses his love for his nephew and sister-in-law. They discuss their lives and the pair plan to go into the city for dinner and a show. Dr. Spensser enters the room wearing a lab coat and summons Henry. The two enter the lab locking the door behind them. Spensser shows his son a tank containing a human brain. Father sarcastically quizzes son on what he sees. It is established that the brain is asleep and can be awakened. Spensser asks the brain a question. He already has the answer. They wait for the brain to complete the computation and respond. A teletype machine gives the answer and it matches exactly. It finally dawns on Henry whose brain just provided the answer and he is horrified. He tells his father ""No! No its inhuman."" But his father disagrees ""Inhuman. It would have been inhuman to deny the world of his genius."" Spensser asks Henry to provide Jeremy's brain a body--a mechanical one. Henry's vanity stroked he is intrigued by the challenge.At a dinner party at the house Anne and John walk the grounds and talk. It is a farewell party for John. When asked about their host Anne tells John that Dr. Spensser and Henry are engrossed in a secret project. John promises to return. In the lab we see in shadow the vessel that will house Jeremy's brain. The phone rings and Henry answers it. It is Anne calling. We see the head and chest of the mechanical man. Spensser is ready to test the machine. Henry tells his father to turn the lever on the left side of the body to activate the creature. A failsafe device out of reach of the monster's own hands has been added. He tells his father ""So he won't be able to destroy himself."" Spensser turns the level and the brain awakens in the body. He can see and hear. The eyes light up and the voice activates. Jeremy is now aware of his condition and complains he can't move. The Frankensteinish creation clomps around the lab in heavy boots knocking over a table. It sees its' reflection in the mirror and screams in horror. Anne hears the commotion from upstairs and runs down to investigate. The creature collapses to the floor. Anne asks Henry about the noise and the voice she recognizes as her late husband's. Henry dismisses the incident telling Anne that Dr. Spensser lost his temper at a failed experiment.Henry returns to the lab. The creature is back in its holding structure. Henry tries to convince his father that to continue Jeremy's new existence is both cruel and wrong. Jeremy implores his father ""You want to help me? Then destroy me!"" Spensser bargains with his son's brain but it demands a condition of his own ""I don't want anyone ever to see me. I will conduct all my experiments in this laboratory with you and Henry and no one else."" Spensser agrees to the bargain. They begin their polar plant growth experiments in terrariums. Jeremy complains of seeing images new and strange ones. One keeps recurring. A ship at sea in the fog the S.S. Viking crashes. Spensser turns down the power and tells his son to rest.Convinced the experiment is a failure Henry discusses a Hawaii vacation with Anne and Billy but before he can finalize plans Spensser calls him to the study. They watch a broadcast about a disaster at sea. The pair return to the lab and tell Jeremy he has the power to see events--E.S.P. He confirms he has seen other images. Spensser exits the lab. Henry remains and chuckles which annoys his disembodied brother. Jeremy threatens Henry ""I warn you Henry. These are powerful (he presents his hands). You know how powerful because you made them. Don't goad me. I warn you don't!""An upcoming meeting is scheduled at the U.N. The topic is the development of polar region grains. John Carrington will be presenting Jeremy's work. It has been one year since Jeremy's death and the monster plans to visit the grave. His father is opposed but Jeremy walks towards the door. Spensser tries to stop him but Jeremy hypnotizes his father with a flashing light from his eyes. He is developing new powers. Jeremy exits the lab and wanders out into the garden. He sees his own headstone and grave marker. He hides himself when he hears his wife's voice warn their son to stay close. Billy places flowers on his father's grave. He is drawn to Jeremy's voice but recoils slightly at the sight of the giant. Billy asks ""Are you a giant? A real giant? Henry and Anne place flowers on the grave. Jeremy picks Billy up in his arms and runs off with his son when he hears Anne calling. Anne asks her son about the monstrous thing.In the lab Jeremy chastises his father. Apparently Spensser told his son that his wife and son had died. That evening Anne suddenly wakes. She senses something slips on a robe and walks out into the garden. Henry discovers her outside and joins her for a walk. She asks about the creature. Henry is cryptic in his response not wanting Anne to know of his complicity. He tells her they must leave the house and soon. He kisses Anne. This enrages Jeremy and he approaches the pair. Anne faints and Henry disappears. Jeremy picks up Anne and carries her back to her bed. The next morning Anne wakes crying. Dr. John Carrington arrives to comfort her. She tells him of her encounter the previous night but he is reluctant to believe such a fantastic story. She insists he leave.Spensser receives a telephone call. It is Henry calling from a phone booth. He asks for money to get away. Jeremy interrupts his father to confirm that he can see where his brother is located. Jeremy instructs his father to set up a meeting so he can intercept and kill his brother. Henry drives to the site of the appointment. He is expecting a messenger with the money. Jeremy walks the bottom of the East River ascends the pier and confronts Henry. He kills his brother with a ray that emanates from his eyes. He walks back home. A commotion in the lab downstairs stirs Dr. Spensser. Jeremy is destroying the polar terrariums and tells his father ""Why create food for the maimed and the useless and the sick? Why should we work to preserve slum people of the world when its simpler and wiser to get rid of them instead? Unfortunately there are so called humanitarian scientists and I am one of them who tried to keep human trash alive. It will be necessary to get rid of those humanitarians first. You understand?"" He hypnotizes his father to champion his plan.The police visit Spensser regarding Henry's death. They ask about the rumors of the creature. Anne is asked about the stories but hesitates to be forthright with the police. Anne tells her father in law she has seen the monster but he tries to convince her she is hallucinating and needs a rest. Billy visits the giant in the garden. Apparently this has been going on for some time. Jeremy becomes upset when Billy reaches towards his on/off switch. Jeremy gives Billy a model airplane exactly like the one he lost the day his father was killed at the airport. Anne asks Billy about the airplane and is upset learning it was a present from the giant.Jeremy commands his father to bring Anne and Billy to the U.N. Building at precisely 8:30 p.m. The family drives to the site. John Carrington accompanies them in the car. Jeremy takes the East River underwater route. In the lobby area they gather as Jeremy enters by crashing through a glass partition. The monster dispatches a few people with his death ray. An upset Billy runs to the giant to make him stop. Jeremy continues his killing spree. Billy confronts his father. Jeremy tells his son he can't control himself but offers to let Billy shut him off. Billy throws the switch deactivating the machine. Jeremy falls over the railing and crashes to the floor below. Anne embraces her son. Dr. Spensser tells John ""Well you were right Carrington without a soul there is nothing but monstrousness. I only wish that heaven and Jeremy could forgive me for what I did."" We close with a close up of the monster's head dripping blood on the floor."

"Ana (Sarah Polley) a nurse finishes a long shift at her Milwaukee County hospital and returns to her peaceful suburban home. She and her waiting husband Louis (Justin Louis) make love and go to sleep missing warnings beginning to trickle through the local media concerning a mysterious and rapidly-spreading contagion which turns its infected hosts into reanimated flesh-eating ghouls.The next morning they are awoken by their zombified neighbor a young girl who bites Louis in the throat. Ana locks the zombie out of the room but despite her frantic efforts Louis dies. When Ana unsuccessfully attempts to call 911 for help Louis immediately awakens as a reanimated zombie and chases Ana into the bathroom. Ana escapes out the window and flees from her now chaos-torn neighborhood in her car before a failed hijacking attempt sends her crashing into a tree. The opening credits roll showing the worldwide collapse of human civilization.Ana meets Kenneth (Ving Rhames) a grim police sergeant traveling to Fort Pastor a nearby US Army base. With the route to the base blocked by zombies they and three others - jack-of-all-trades Michael (Jake Weber) petty criminal Andre (Mekhi Phifer) and his pregnant Russian wife Luda (Inna Korobkina)- break into the nearby Crossroads Shopping Mall. Inside the mall a scuffle with a zombified mall security guard results in Luda getting a minor bite-wound and Kenneth getting a cut on his arm.They confront three living security guards - C.J. (Michael Kelly) Bart (Michael Barry) and Terry (Kevin Zegers) - and give up their weapons in exchange for refuge. After the group secures the mall they head up to the mall's roof to dispose of bodies and paint SOS signs. There they ""meet"" another survivor Andy (Bruce Bohne) who is stranded alone in his gun store across the mall's zombie-infested parking lot.The next day a delivery truck arrives at the mall carrying the driver Norma (Jayne Eastwood) jerkish Steve (Ty Burrell) working man Tucker (Boyd Banks) elderly Glen (R.D. Reid) trampy Monica (Kim Poirier) bitten Frank (Matt Frewer) and his teen daughter Nicole (Lindy Booth) and an anonymous (and severely-injured) obese woman (Ermes Blarasin). These newcomers report that Fort Pastor has been overrun by zombies and no help is coming. Shortly after the obese woman dies reanimates and is killed by Ana who thrusts a metal fireplace poker into her eye. The group determines that bites are how the zombies multiply their numbers; after Ana and Michael argue about what to do with the rapidly-deteriorating Frank the man is isolated in a store with guard Kenneth allowing him ""every single second"" before expiring. Michael and Ana achieve an awkward reconciliation which is interrupted by Kenneth's shotgun blast as he destroys Frank's reanimated body.Though the mall provides many material distractions and the survivors begin pairing off romantically (Ana and Michael Terry and Nicole Steve and Monica) the undead surround the refuge in ever-increasing numbers. Finally the malls power goes out and Michael C.J. Bart and Kenneth enter the underground parking garage to turn on the emergency generator. They meet a friendly dog (Blue) who appears unharmed nor infected. They question this when a zombie suddenly bites Bart which attracts more zombies that forces the group to flee. While trying to avoid the horde Michael and Kenneth reach the generator compartment and C.J. joins them when Bart is overwhelmed and killed by the zombies. They eventually work together to douse the zombies with gasoline and set them ablaze.Andre faced with the fact that Luda will soon die sinks totally into denial and has his heavily-pregnant and infected wife tied to a bed in the mall's children's store. As she gives birth she dies and reanimates. Norma checks on the couple discovering the zombie-Luda and the demented Andre clutching a small bundle of blankets. Norma shoots Luda causing Andre to snap completely; they exchange more gunfire and both are killed. Ana arrives on scene and opens the bundle to reveal a zombie baby. She pulls her revolver and a single shot rings through the mall.At an impromptu memorial Kenneth says anything is better than ""sitting around waiting to die"". The remaining mall-dwellers thus plot to fight their way to the local marina and from there travel out on Steve's small yacht to an island in Lake Michigan. They reinforce two small shuttle buses from the parking garage removing the seats welding on a snowplow attaching metal bars and floodlights stringing barbed wire boarding up the windows and cutting slits for the deployment of weapons. Chainsaws propane tanks and other supplies are also loaded on board. Meanwhile Andy is starving and will not have the strength to join the escape (and contribute much-needed ammunition) so the mall survivors strap a pack of food on ""Chips"" the dog from the basement and lower him into the parking lot in a sling. Unfortunately while Chips makes it safely to the gun-shop a zombie sees the dog and gets in as well and bites Andy. Nicole distraught over Chips takes the delivery truck and barges her way into the gun store where a now-zombified Andy traps her in a closet.Kenneth Michael C.J. Terry and Tucker gather their meager weapon supply and go into the sewers while Steve is assigned guard-duty on their exit door. They reach the gun store where they kill Andy rescue Nicole and stock up on weapons and ammunition. A detonated propane tank is used to clear a path back to the sewers but the zombies pursue them. Along the way Tucker breaks his legs and despite C.J.'s desperate attempts to pull him to safety is attacked by the perusing zombies forcing C.J. to shoot him dead out of mercy. Thanks to Steve's negligence the zombies force open the exit door. The survivors pile into the buses and smash out into the parking lot where another propane bomb is used to clear a path through the waiting horde. When Glen moves to take out a last hitchhiking zombie with a chainsaw a sudden swerve sends the weapon slashing into Monica's shoulder. The resulting splatter of blood covers the windshield causing driver Kenneth to lose control and crash. Glen and Monica are killed while Steve flees the toppled bus and is attacked by the hitchhiking zombie.The others scramble for the second bus meeting zombie-Steve en route. Ana shoots him dead then must linger long enough to get the boat keys off his corpse allowing more zombies to catch up with them. Ana flees back to the bus where Michael helps her in. After a short struggle they pull away and speed to the marina dock where they crash the bus and dash for the boat. Cornered in the bus by their pursuers C.J. detonates a final propane tank blowing up the vehicle the zombies and himself. The remainder of the group gets on the boat except for Michael; he was bitten while helping Ana. Ana futilely pleads with him to come and the boat sets sail with Terry Ana Kenneth Nicole and Chips. Ana watches unflinchingly as Michael draws his pistol places it under his chin and a final gunshot rings out over the water.The end-credits roll interspersed with video footage taken by Terry using a camera from the boat. Following a grim voyage where water fuel and food supplies all run low the remaining survivors succeed in reaching an island only to be immediately attacked by a new swarm of zombies. As the survivors attempt to retreat to the boat the camera falls to the ground and blacks out leaving their ultimate fate unknown.

"A man (Arie Verveen) is walking in the woods and comes upon a dog that he believes to be sleeping. After poking it a few times he pulls the dog up and notices that the dog's flesh is rotted spurting blood on him in the process.Meanwhile five college friends Jeff (Joey Kern) Marcy (Cerina Vincent) Paul (Rider Strong) Karen (Jordan Ladd) and Bert (James DeBello) are driving in a van through rural Alabama on their way to the woods for they have rented a cabin in the woods. Along the way they stop at a local convenience store for food where a young boy (Matthew Helms) outside the store bites Paul on the hand. The locals standing nearby look at the outsiders in their town with suspicion and scorn.When they arrive at the cabin Jeff and Marcy immediately retire to their bedroom and have sex. Paul and Karen go for a swim in the lake while Bert goes hunting for squirrels in the woods. He accidentally shoots the man who discovered the rotting dog in the beginning of the film while hunting whom he mistook for a squirrel. By this time the man's face has become badly rotted. Scared Bert shoots at him again in order to repel him and runs back to the cabin.That evening the five kids build a bonfire and share ghost stories with each other. They soon encounter a local college kid named Grim (Eli Roth) who approaches them with his dog Dr. Mambo. Though he acts a little eccentric they allow him to join in when he offers them marijuana. However once it starts raining he leaves to take care of his camping equipment and the group retreats into the house.Later on that night they hear a knocking at the door and discover it's the diseased man that Bert shot before. Desperate for help the hermit comes after the group. He tries to drive away in their car but vomits blood all over the windscreen and the seats of the car. After the man exits the car Paul sets-light to the infected man and he runs aflame back into the woods where he dies in the lake.In the morning a young deputy Winston Olsen (Giuseppe Andrews) shows up at the cabin and promises Paul he'll call a tow truck. Jeff and Bert walk off down the lake shore when they come to a woman's house to ask for a ride into town. They soon discover that the woman was related to the hermit they killed so they leave quickly. During this time Karen drinks a glass of water from the lake contaminated by the infected man and begins to feel ill. She goes to bed to rest. Paul later discovers rotten boils on her thighs. Karen is then quarantined in the tool shed outside.Fearing that they will soon also become infected with whatever is ailing Karen as well as the man the night before the others begin to argue with one another over what they should do about their situation.The next day they discover Karen's condition is deteriorating fast. Bert also realizes that he himself is infected with the virus. Bert drives off to find a doctor. When Paul and Marcy insist on helping Karen Jeff runs off into the forest with the remaining beer (the only reliable drinking source). Marcy yells at him as he flees upset that he has abandoned her.Meanwhile Bert drives to the convenience store that the group visited earlier pleading for a doctor. He shows increasing signs of infection. The young retarded redneck boy on the bench then runs over and bites Bert again thereby infecting himself. His father (Hal Courtney) comes outside and rather than helping Bert tries to kill him. Bert speeds off and the father grabs two of his redneck friends (Richard Boone and Tim Parati) who arm themselves with rifles to go after Bert to kill him.Now alone in the cabin Paul finds Marcy sitting despondently on her bed. He tries to reassure her but she reiterates that they are all doomed to get sick to the point where ""all you want to do is grab the person next to you and to have sex with because you know you're gonna be dead soon anyway."" She seduces Paul and they begin having wild sex. Paul expresses concern that they aren't using a condom. Marcy brushes him off without heed by saying ""Don't worry I'm healthy!"" and continues riding him.After they finish having sex Paul worries about whether Marcy has the disease or not. He goes into the bathroom and attempts to disinfect his penis by pouring Listerine over it. While washing her face Marcy discovers with worry some red marks on her back where Paul grabbed her in the heat of their sexual encounter.A little later Paul tells Marcy that he's going to bring back Jeff so that they can all walk back to civilization. Marcy urges him to stay but Paul seems uncomfortable around her after sleeping with her and insists that he ""has to get out of"" the cabin. Now completely alone Marcy has a bath and weeps. The marks Paul made on her back are shown to be developing into gruesome wounds like Karen's.Paul heads over to the local reservoir and notices a body floating in the lake. He climbs down the ladder and moves the body with a stick. He sees that it is the infected hermit. The dock's ladder rots and gives way causing Paul to fall into the infected water ensuring that he is definitely infected by this point.Back at the cabin Marcy is shown shaving her legs in the bathtub and notices they are beginning to deteriorate as the skin begins gorily peeling off. She runs outside upset and is attacked by a now infected Dr. Mambo. Paul returns to find Marcy's body ripped to pieces and Dr. Mambo eating a motionless Karen's face. The dog attempts to attack him too. However Paul kills him with Bert's rifle. Now alone Paul goes to check on Karen whose skin has now almost fully rotted off; she is barely alive. To end her suffering he clubs and impales her with a shovel and then runs for help.Just then Bert struggles back to the cabin with the rednecks in pursuit. When Bert's pursuers open the door Bert tries to shoot one of the men but is killed by a shotgun round. Paul comes and successfully kills the store owner and his friends. After fleeing the cabin Paul decides to look for Jeff. He checks a cave thinking Jeff is inside but only finds Grim's dead body.Paul then runs back to Bert's pursuers' car and drives into town. Along the way he slams head-on into a deer damaging the windshield and the car. He continues on foot until he sees a roadside party thrown by local teens with Winston in attendance. Winston asks Paul about the tow truck just as a police officer gets on the radio warning Winston about Paul and his group whom are infected with a strange disease and that they are to be shot on sight. After all of the party attendees leave Paul knocks Winston out with a stick. Paul is picked-up by a passing trucker and brought to the hospital.The sheriff and doctors interrogate him while he is lying in a hospital bed trying to discover the source of the infection but Paul is slightly dazed and unable to answer all their questions. When he is left alone Paul pulls up his hospital gown to reveal the tell-tale marks of the disease on his belly. The doctors determine they are not equipped to handle the situation and that he should be transported to a larger nearby regional hospital. His driver turns out to be Winston. Paul tries to warn him about the water in the reservoir but he can't speak well and only says ""water"". Winston says he will take him to get water.The next morning Jeff comes out of the woods where he was hiding and makes his way back to the cabin. As he looks around horrified that his friends are dead he is suddenly shot to death by the redneck police. The murderous sheriff and his men take Jeff's dead body and pile it on top of the others which are burned in a fire pit.While unconscious Paul is dumped into a stream by Winston and left to die. Paul's body infects the water in the stream. Further down are two kids collecting water for their lemonade stand. They sell some lemonade to the sheriff his deputies and more locals at the store.

"A Russian peasant family is sitting down to dinner when a run-down overheating truck comes to a halt in the front yard. The Father opens the door to find a now dead woman obviously murdered and two crying infants in the seat next to her.40 years later. We meet Marie Jones who has been summoned back to Russia by a notary who claims to have found her long dead parents and the home they once owned. As she mounts the steps to his office she runs into someone but brushes it off.After meeting with the notary who explains he found no other living heirs she sets out to visit and claim her parent's home. She arrives at the house where her mother died and is ""attacked"" by a now very old mother who in Russian insists that she not go to the Kardinovsky Farm. They're interrupted by Anitoly her guide the only person willing to venture to the farm at night.The farm sits on the ""island"" a small parcel of land surrounded by the river and only accessible by a bridge. After hours of driving they cross the bridge and stop just a few yards from the house. Anitoly tells Marie to stay put while he makes sure there are no animals between them and the house.Marie waits and then sees what appears to be Anitoly ahead of her but when she leaves the truck she finds herself alone. Within minutes the truck dies leaving the forest quiet.With no one around and no where else to go she enters the old house armed only with a flashlight and begins to investigate. While exploring the ground floor she hears a bang and a child wailing from upstairs and rushes up as quickly as possible to see... nothing. She enters the nearest room a nursery and sees out of the corner of her eye a woman walking past the door.When she runs into the hallway she sees the same blonde woman turn into another room and she follows only to scream as she comes face to face with her doppleganger who appears to be very real and soaked to the bone. She runs out the door in time to see the truck (and presumably Anitoly) leave. In a panic she chases him and falls down a hill and into the river where since she can't swim she begins to drown.She wakes up in a much warmer and brighter lit room in the house. There is a man (Nikolai) rifling through her wallet. Marie smacks him across the face with a log then flees the room.He chases her and explains that he is her brother and that he too was summoned by the notary. She is of course skeptical as the notary had told her she had no brothers or sisters but when he takes her upstairs and shows her their cribs she realizes he is telling the truth.She tells him what she saw and he explains that seeing your double shows you the way in which you will die.Very quickly they meet Nikolai's doppleganger (a bloody ravaged body) and they both realize they have to get out of the house and off the island. As they get ready to flee Nikolai falls through a hole in the floor and vanishes leaving Marie alone. She returns upstairs determined to find anything to explain what is happening. Upstairs in her parents room she witnesses some of the events of the past as she watches her father stab her mother to death on their bed. Screaming she turns to find her doppleganger behind her yet again. This time it catches her in the babies' room and seems to suck out part of her life leaving her gasping and disoriented. She flees the house.There is a boat on one side of the river and she takes it to the other side leaving the island and her doppleganger (watching from the shore) behind her. Unfortunately it's too late and as she runs through the forest she finds herself before the house again.This time when she enters she finds the dining room is suddenly... clean and neat as it must have been decades before. At the table looking morosely at a birthday cake is an injured Nikolai. He didn't die but merely fell into the basement through the floor. He explains to Marie that he's figured out what is going on: they were never meant to have left the house in the first place. They were supposed to have died with their mother all those years ago and now on the eve of their birthday the house has called them back to fulfill their destinies at midnight.When the clock strikes midnight the entire house returns to the state it was in 1966 and they hear their father enter the house. Marie tries to intercept hoping to change the past but Nikolai intervenes and tells her that it's already happened and that the only way to survive would be to get away from there in the past where the house can't touch them. But when they try they get separated. Marie ends up in the back of the truck as her father drives away with the infants (herself and Nikolai) whereas Nikolai sees the form of his long lost love Natalie.Her father stops at the barn leaving one baby in a pig's pen to feed the baby to the boars while he tries to drown the other in the boars' water tank. Neither he nor his wife (who he had thought was dead) see Marie. Her dying mother shoots her father in the head and grabs both babies fleeing to the truck. Meanwhile Nikolai turns to see his lover is now actually his father and then is attacked by wild boars fulfilling his destiny.Marie finds her father's now desiccated body in the farm and is then pushed back into a pseudo-past where she realizes her father and the notary are one and the same. He's come back from the dead to lure his children to the hell he had created. She flees his office in the present and runs right into her past self as she comes up the steps and continues to flee into the sunlight until she finds herself right back in the house this time between the past the present where the apparition of her father explains to her that he's always loved his children and his wife and couldn't let them leave him. She runs from him down the hall and finds Nikolai's body being eaten by the boars. As they tear off his nose and parts of his stomach she vomits and falls against the wall. It's only when her doppleganger comes after her that she flees out to the truck parked out front and drives away.Her father's voice comes over the radio telling her to come back and join the family he has created and then promises to take her daughter Emily (who is in the States) but it's too late. The bridge that brought her there has been destroyed and Marie plunges into the lake drowning and fulfilling her destiny.The film ends with Marie's daughter (who we now realize is the narrator) explaining that she knew in her heart her mother would never return. It's been months since she left for Russia and in all this time she's never had the desire to know what happened to her or her parents thus breaking the cycle and leaving her... abandoned.

His last word is to his stone-faced family is ""why?"" The doctor's diagnosis of Giorgio's death is an internal haemorrhage possibly from an stomach or intestinal ulcer. The following day Giorgio's daughter Rosie (Karina Huff) arrives at the Mainardi estate having taken a leave of absence from her college studies to attend the funeral and for the reading of the will. Rosie soon finds her entire family squabbling over the estate. Giorgio's middle-aged stepmother Hilda (Frances Nacmen) refuses permission for an autopsy and taunts her elderly husband Giorgio's father Paolo (Paolo Paoloni) who is near death himself from a recent stroke and is unable to move or speak. Meanwhile Hilda's own son Mario (Pascal Persiano) is revealed to be having an affair with Giorgio's young third wife Lucy (Bettina Giovannini). Lucy is only a few years older than Rosie and is apparently the only one of the Mainardi family who shows any compassion for her presence.Giorgio's spirit remains conscious after death and from his buried coffin he tries to communicate with Rosie. He succeeds by entering her dreams and entreats her to discover who in the family was responsible for his death. However he tells her to hurry for as his corpse rots away in the coffin so does his power to communicate with his daughter. At the funeral each of the family mourners think back to their relationship with the dead man. Lucy remembers his anger at her frigidity. Mario recalls how Giorgio humiliated and insulated him after he asked for financial help in obtaining a business position. Hilda fumes over the memory of Giorgio ordering the bank not to let her cash the checks from his sick fathers account. Rita (Antonella Tinazzo) Giorgio's mistress remembers being spurned when Giorgio rudely broke off their secret affair and decided to go back to his wife.At the reading of the will bad feelings erupt when it is found that Giorgio has left his entire estate to Rosie. Lucy however is allowed to remain at the house. But even she is angry because no provision has been made to their child David a little boy whom Giorgio believes was not his.Despite Hilda's objections an autopsy on Giorgio goes ahead. The pathologist (Lucio Fulci) takes a sample of his small intestines and discovers some lacerations to the interior wall. He puts the sample in a jar of formaldide for later inspection. A little later Rosie and her college boyfriend Gianni (Lorenzo Flaherty) discover that the jar containing the organ pieces removed from Giorgios corpse have been ""accidently"" smashed. But Gianni a medical student with access to the pathology lab tells Rosie that he'd found minute splinters of glass in the intestines before the accident accrued later that night.

Rosie suspects that Rita may have put the mini-glass shards in his food. Lucy talks to the Maitre d' (Tomasso Felleghy) at a local restaurant where Rita and Giorgio visited for their secret dates. But the Maitre d' tells Rosie that the couple ate and drank nothing having pitched into a furious row the moment they arrives over Giorgio wanting to end their clandestine affair. They soon left the restaurant without even drinking a glass of wine. With Rita written off as a suspect Rosie returns to the house but accidentally discovers that her soda drinks have been poisoned when a mini hypodermic hole is found at the top of one of her cans of soda. Rosie talks to Dorie the housekeeper (Sacha Maria Darwin) and little David's nanny who says that only she David and Lucy were in the house on the night of Giorgio's death. Rosie notices that David is playing with a mortar and pestle. She confronts Lucy who acts oddly but seems distressed rather than panicked by her stepdaughter's suspicions.After a significant dream Rosie wakes up with the answer to the puzzle. The glass shards had been concealed in the ice-cubes Giorgio Mainardi took with his late-night drinks. Rosie confronts Lucy and reveals that the plot must have been hatched by the grasping Hilda Mainardi and her son Mario. Hilda enters and admits the plot to kill Giorgio for his money and adding slyly that Lucy has known about the plot but did nothing to stop them. In case of discovery young David had been encouraged to play with the mortar and pestle grinding up a light bulb into tiny splinters an adding them to the water in the ice-cube tray as a ""game."" They way Hilda hoped to explain the murder away as a tragic accident. Rosie tells Hilda that she will leave the conspirators to fest in the Mainardi house together instead of informing the police.

"The movie open with title and credits shown over a slab of marble. A lightning storm rages outside while inside a seaside house a dog sits by the fire and a woman reclines on a couch. Maria (Rosa Rey) places a blanket on the sleeping woman Elaine Randolph (Claudia Drake). Elaine scolds Maria for her superstitious ways. The dog Brutus stands and points in the direction of the door. Shadrach (Willie Best) runs into the room rambling about something outside. He is the houseboy or butler and claims the thing took a body into the doctor's laboratory.Dr. David Cochran (Robert Shayne) tells Dr. Charles Randolph (John Carradine) that the body he just finished examining has been dead for a couple of hours. The two men begin working on the body of a fisherman (an uncredited Clark Kuney). Cochran hooks electrical equipment up to the body while Randolph retrieves a bottle of liquid from the refrigerator and connects it as an IV. Randolph explains that the man drowned under ideal conditions for their experiment. Cochran is having second thoughts and tells Randolph ""I'm worried about the authorities sir. Do you think we're doing the right thing by performing this experiment?"" Randolph replies ""Certainly. If there's the slightest chance of bringing a man back to life it's a doctor's duty."" Randolph adds that he will take full responsibility. Elaine wanders into the lab and gasps. Dr. Cochran escorts her out and locks the door. The two doctors apply the full charge of electricity and the man on the table takes on a chalky white appearance but opens his eyes and blinks. The man stares at the two doctors and then rises from the table. An explosion in their equipment causes the standing fisherman to grab his neck and collapse to the floor dead.Elaine paces the floor upstairs as Doctors Cochran and Randolph return to the house. Cochran is worried about the consequences of their experiment but Randolph rationalizes that he was dead when they found him and he's dead now. Randolph and Cochran each go to their rooms for the evening. Elaine goes to Cochran's room to talk. She demands to know what Randolph was doing with the dead fisherman. She pleads with Cochran to stop Randolph or at least leave the premises. Maria spies on the pair from outside. Randolph goes to his wife's room but she is in with Cochran. Brutus is waiting outside Cochran's door and Randolph knows the dog is devoted to his wife so that is where he will find her. After a brief exchange in Cochran's room the Randolphs leave to their separate rooms. Brutus walks back to Elaine's door.The next morning Randolph and Cochran join for breakfast. Randolph shows Cochran a newspaper article ""Body of Sailor Found on Beach."" Cochran comments to Randolph that Maria doesn't like him. Randolph confides that Maria and Brutus are devoted to his wife. Cochran presents a voodoo doll and tells Randolph he found it under his pillow. Randolph explains he lived in the jungle long enough to become familiar with the rituals ""This one is supposed to make you fall in love.""Maria is tending to her mistress. Maria tells her she has arranged a love match with Dr. Cochran. Inspector Norton (Thomas E. Jackson) arrives at the house. He identifies himself to Shadrach as a policeman with the homicide squad. He wishes to talk to either of the Randolphs. While Shadrach gets Elaine Inspector Norton invites himself into the living room. Elaine joins him and Norton explains it is merely a social call. Randolph had assisted him on a case some years before. Elaine explains that she has only been married for a year. She was the victim of an accident and Randolph operated and saved her life. Cochran is working in the lab and finds another love voodoo doll in his coat pocket. He dunks it into a beaker of corrosive liquid and Maria collapses on the staircase dropping a tray of glassware. She tumbles to the base of the stairs. The commotion brings Norton Cochran and Elaine out to see what happened. Cochran examines her and proclaims her ok. She accuses the doctor of destroying the doll and tells him death is the penalty for such a crime.Randolph installs the new equipment in the lab. Cochran tells Randolph he's decided to return to his regular practice but Randolph persuades Cochran to stay. Norton drops by to see Randolph and suspects him of involvement with the dead fisherman: He offers as evidence his use of electricity and buying new equipment. Randolph is calm and deflects most of the more pointed questions. Randolph returns to the lab and Cochran joins him. Randolph tells his colleague to lock the door and close the windows. Brutus is lying on the table dead. Randolph will use the dead dog as his next subject. Cochran gets his revised formula and sets up a drip. Randolph applies the electricity but the dog does not revive. A short time later they exit the lab and hear the dog barking. They search the lab and find the angry animal. Four shots from a revolver fail to kill the dog. It jumps through the closed window like a ghost.The next morning Elaine joins Randolph and Cochran for breakfast. She complains she hasn't been able to find Brutus. Randolph lies and tells her he took the dog to the Vet because he was acting strangely. And speaking of strange Elaine is told it is David's birthday so she passionately kisses the man. Shadrach answers the door. Linda Sinclair (Maris Wrixon) has arrived and asks for David Cochran. Randolph sent Linda a telegram without telling David inviting Linda to the house as a surprise. Linda's arrival is not so welcomed by Elaine or Maria. The two couples are in the living room smoking and enjoying a drink. They hear the howls of Brutus and the two doctors exchange glances as Elaine steps to the window to investigate. The two doctors claim to have heard nothing. It is late and the ladies retire for the evening. Linda is awakened in the night by Brutus howling. She sees him materialize in her bedroom. He barks at her which brings Elaine into her room to investigate. When she turns on the light the dog disappears. Linda moves to Elaine's room.The next morning the ladies join the men at the breakfast table. Shadrach enters the room and informs Randolph that Inspector Norton is here again. Norton informs Randolph that he is looking for a dog Brutus. He asks point blank ""Where is he?"" Randolph lies and tells Norton he is at the Vet and has been for a week. Brutus is suspect in the killing of farm animals and draining their blood. Norton departs and Elaine enters the living room and asks ""It was Brutus wasn't it Charles? And it was he last night wasn't it?"" Randolph reluctantly acknowledges ""Yes...It was an experiment. Something went wrong."" Still at the breakfast table Linda demands that she and David both leave today. She relays the story of Brutus from the night before. He agrees to leave the next day. Cochran tells Randolph he and Linda are leaving but they are evasive as to the reason.Elaine moves into Linda's room and moves Linda's things to her room. Elaine tells Linda that she isn't afraid of the dog apparition and adds that it wouldn't harm her. That evening Maria cooks up a spell and places a vial of a smoking substance in Linda's room. She does not realize the two women have switched rooms. Elaine coughs and chokes on the noxious fumes. She tries to open the window but collapses and dies before she can. Randolph and Cochran notice something burning and are drawn to Linda's room. They enter and find Elaine on the floor. Cochran carries her out of the bedroom and places her body on his own bed. Maria sees to her horror that Linda is still alive. Cochran pronounces Elaine dead ""About half an hour I'd say."" Randolph is distraught but Cochran suggests they revive her with their formula and electrical technique. Randolph hesitates to agree but Cochran explains that he has revised the formula and will conduct the experiment alone if necessary.In the lab Cochran prepares the formula as Randolph connect the electrical equipment. Linda looks on. Cochran connects the IV and Randolph fires up the electrical machinery. The lab lights up and Linda approaches the table to get a better look. As Linda's skin turns a chalky white she blinks then opens her eyes. Linda is amazed by what she witnesses. Cochran administers a drug to relax her cranial nerves and her skin returns to a normal color. She opens her eyes and begins to move. She calls to David not her husband. They return her to her room and Cochran congratulates Randolph on his discovery. Linda observes that Elaine is in love with David. Randolph realizes the same. He examines the vial and observes it was a poison that killed his wife. He gives the vial to Cochran and tells him to smell the contents. He tells Cochran that it is the root of a plant used in the voodoo death ceremony. Maria spies on the two doctors and overhears their conversation. They know it was Maria. Cochran convinces Randolph not to kill Maria with a dagger and then takes Randolph to his room. Brutus returns to Elaine's room and stands next to her bed. To Shadrach's amazement he sees Brutus and Elaine enter the hallway through her closed door. They descend the stairs into the living room. Shadrach witnesses Maria hand Elaine the dagger and point towards Randolph working in the study. Maria watches as Elaine stabs her husband in the back. Maria takes the dagger and Elaine return to her room with the dog. The two pass through the door like ghosts.Inspector Norton asks Maria questions regarding the murder. She tells Norton that Randolph and Cochran were arguing a few hours earlier and struggling over the knife. Jeff the fingerprint man (Neal Burns) gets prints off the knife. He will later reveal they were in fact the prints of Dr. Cochran. Norton admits that he is convinced that David Cochran is the killer and arrests the young doctor. Of course David protests his innocence. Linda perceptively observes ""Elaine that woman Maria I think shes at the bottom of all this."" She tells Elaine that Maria tried to kill her but didn't know Elaine was sleeping in Linda's room. Linda tells Elaine she is going to the police right now. Maria returns to the fire and conjures another spell.At headquarters David explains to Norton that he took the knife from Randolph because he was going to kill Maria for causing his wife's accident. David manages to escape custody just about the time Shadrach arrives to explain the events to Norton. David dries back to the house. Elaine and Brutus ascend the stairs heading for Linda's room. Linda exits the bedroom sees Brutus and Elaine and returns to her bedroom. She locks the door and turns off the light. The pair simply pass through the locked door. David enters the house and hears Linda scream upstairs. He breaks in and is attacked by the dog. The police arrive in time to witness Linda on the bed and David wrestling on the floor with nothing. They are the only two in the room when Norton turns on the light. David revives Linda as Norton goes down to find Maria dead from the same toxic root she used on Elaine. We close with a scene of footprints leading into the ocean."

Harry runs back home and writes Moss' name in his ""Bad Boys & Girls"" book.On his way home from work Harry peeps into the window of a local bar and sees co-worker Frank Stoller whom earlier that day had phoned-in sick and Harry had relieved on the assembly line. Harry becomes angry that Frank lied to him about being sick just to avoid not going to work. Harry rushes home hums a Christmas tune and breaks one of his male dollhouse figures.The following morning Harry phones his younger brother Phil (Jeffrey DeMunn) and cancels his plans to come over for Thanksgiving dinner with Phil and his family.One month later on Christmas Eve the Company Christmas party for Jolly Dreams is in full swing. Harry watches the owner of Jolly Dreams making a televised announcement that if production increases sufficiently the company will be able to donate toys to the disadvantaged children at Willowy Springs State Hospital. Just then Harry is greeted by one of his co-workers named Ben who thanks him for taking Frank's place at the warehouse on the assembly line. Frank then introduces Harry to newcomer employee George.At home Harry realizes that people generally consider him a ""schmuck"" and is constantly exploited by others. He then has a nervous breakdown and he is now convinced that he truly is Santa Claus. Down in his basement workshop he begins smelting toy soldiers (with swords at attention) and small axes.Alone after-hours Harry gets a brilliant idea. He steals company toys wraps them loads them into his van and later drops them off at the hospital. He then leaves a bagful of dirt at bad-boy Moss Garcia's doorstep. Sometime later Harry passes by a local community center where a party is being held. Two men outside see Harry in his Santa costume and mistake him for the Santa that was supposed to show up for the children. They pull him inside where Harry has fun mingling with the other attendees and giving toy soldiers to the children also there.

Their children are preoccupied with watching a television program and do not seem to mind playing with their damaged and sub-par toys.At the closed warehouse Harry gains entrance and activates the assembly lines breaking even-more toys in the process.That night he drives off and his van becomes stuck in the snow on a beautifully decorated street with plenty of lights sending him further into a delusional state. By now his costume is dirty and dishevelled. He eventually finds himself on the wrong side of his brother's neighborhood. When he offers to give a toy soldier to a group of needy children the children's parents happen by and threaten Harry. One father attacks him with a switchblade knife before the children come to Harry's defense and allow him to get away. Now a large torch-bearing mob pursues him. Nevertheless he manages to drive his van out of the sludge and arrives at his brother's house.Phil quickly realizes that his brother is the homicidal Santa he has heard announced on the news. Harry tries to justify his actions to his brother but Phil proceeds to choke him unconscious. Phil loads Harry into the front seat of the van whereupon Harry comes-to cold-cocks him and again drives off. During his escape the oncoming mob appears on the road and forces him and his van off a bridge. The van then is shown to magically fly off towards the moon as Harry's voice over reads the end of ""Twas the Night Before Christmas.""

"The film opens at night on a snow-covered college campus. There is a Christmas party underway in one of the sorority houses a large converted mansion. The sorority sisters and many of their boyfriends are inside. Outside in the snow a point-of-view shot illustrates someone looking into the windows. The person breathes heavily and seems to be a man but this is all we can tell. The person prowls around before climbing a rose trellis and entering the house through an attic window. He then climbs down through the attic trap door and lurks in the upstairs of the house watching the girls downstairs.One of the sorority sisters Barb Coard (Margot Kidder) receives a phone call from her mother. Barb seems to have been planning on going home over the Christmas holiday but her mother has made plans to go away with her latest boyfriend. Barb calls her mother a gold-plated whore and says she'll make other plans for the break. She asks fellow sorority sisters Phyllis Carlson (Andrea Martin) and Jessica Bradford (Olivia Hussey) to go skiing with her instead. Jess also gets a phone call from her boyfriend Peter (Kier Dullea) an aspiring concert pianist. She seems tense and wants to talk to Peter about something important. She says she'll see him tomorrow at the rehearsal studio. After their boyfriends leave the girls get another phone call; Jess answers the phone and announces to all the other girls that its ""The Moaner"". Together they listen to the bizarre phone call which starts out with simply heavy breathing and then
escalates into strange ranting and obscene language. Barb gets on the receiver and bawls out the caller firing back with her own obscene comments until the caller suddenly lowers his voice and says ""I'm going to kill you."" He then hangs up.A sorority sister named Clare Harrison (Lynne Griffin) seems more timid than the others. She questions Barb's judgment in provoking an unstable individual and reminds her that a girl from town was raped recently by an unknown assailant. Barb reacts angrily and upsets Clare who then goes upstairs to pack; her father is picking her up the next day to take her home for Christmas. Clare finds Claude the house mother's cat in her room even though the door is closed. She is unaware the killer is watching her from within her closet. In a morbid twist the psychopath meows like Claude and lures Clare into the closet where he lunges at her and wraps plastic cleaning bags around her head smothering her to death. He then carries her body up into the attic and places it in a rocking chair by the window the plastic bag still over her head. He places a doll in her lap and refers to her as Agnes.Downstairs the other girls are oblivious to Clare's death and they welcome in the house mother Mrs. Mac (Marian Waldman) who seems to have just returned from shopping. They present her with a Christmas gift: a frilly nightgown. She pretends to like it but makes sarcastic remarks about it (and the girls themselves) while she is alone. Mrs. Mac goes to the library and seeks a book--""B for Booze!""--and hidden inside of it is a bottle of brandy from which she takes a secret drink. She later fishes a bottle out of the toilet tank in her bathroom as well and rinses her mouth with booze after brushing her teeth.The next day Clare's father (James Edmond) comes to collect her but she is not at the appointed place. When he seeks her at the sorority house he is shocked by the sexually suggestive posters he finds in her room and also surprised that she has a boy's photo next to her bed (her boyfriend Chris). Mr. Harrison seems to blame Mrs. Mac for the permissive attitude in the house. Mrs. Mac assures him that Clare is a good girl and that she's probably just at one of the fraternity houses visiting Chris. Mr. Harrison offers to drop Mrs. Mac off at the store on his way there. Before they leave Mrs. Mac hears Claude meowing but cannot find him; he is in the attic.Jess visits Peter while he is practicing for a very important audition and she breaks some news to him: she is unexpectedly pregnant. Peter thinks it's good news but Jess admits that she wasnt even going to tell Peter about it. Jess intends to get an abortion. Peter is adamantly opposed to this and makes an ominous threat against Jess for even considering such a thing.Barb is at the fraternity house with Phyl's boyfriend who is dressed like Santa and taking photos with small children. Barb has a bottle of wine and is getting drunk and she gives one of the children sips of her alcohol. Mr. Harrison phones home and assures his wife that they will find Clare.Back at the sorority house Jess receives another obscene phone call. This one is more elaborate; the killer speaks in several different voices and makes references to ""Agnes"" and ""Billy"". He also seems to be speaking in the voices of two adults presumably the parents of Agnes and Billy. The voices even seem to overlap at times adding to the unsettling effect. Jess is upset especially after her confrontation with Peter.Phyl and Barb take Mr. Harrison to the police station to report Clare missing. The officer on duty at the desk Sgt. Nash (Douglas McGrath) endures hostility from Barb about the incident. Sgt. Nash tells Mr. Harrison that hes sure Clare is just somewhere with Chris. Sgt. Nash asks Barb for the phone number at the sorority house and she tells him its Fellatio-20880. ""It's a new exchange FE"" she explains. Nash who apparently does not know the meaning of the word fellatio writes it down and thanks her.Back at the sorority house Mrs. Mac tells Jess that Clare is missing so Jess goes to see Chris while he is at hockey practice. Chris is furious when Jess tells him that the police are not taking it seriously because they think she's shacked up somewhere with him.Peter performs his audition and fails miserably distraught about the news Jess has given him. The instructors who listen to the recital are shocked that he cannot seem to hit the right notes and later he destroys the piano after they've gone.Chris and Jess appear at the police station and Chris angrily lashes out at Sgt. Nash for having a big mouth (meaning his suggestion that Clare was shacked up with him). Lt. Fuller (John Saxon) overhears and becomes interested in the case--he has already been taking another missing person report from a distraught mother named Mrs. Quaife whose 13-year-old daughter Janice has suddenly disappeared while on her way home from school.Mr. Harrison has dinner with Phyl Barb and Mrs. Mac at the sorority house but Barb is extremely drunk and launches into a vulgar tirade that ends with her lashing out at the others. Barb feels guilty because she was careless to Clare and she says the others think her disappearance is Barb's fault. Barb's curt suggestion that Clare might be dead shocks Mr. Harrison and Phyl reacts angrily telling Barb to go to bed. Barb goes upstairs and leaves them alone. Meanwhile Jess and Chris come back to the house and tell the others about Janice Quaife's disappearance. A search is underway and Phyl and Mr. Harrison join them. Mrs. Mac tells them that she's leaving for her sisters house and may not be there when they return. When Jess leaves Mrs. Mac packs her bags and calls a cab but she is distracted by sounds from the attic: the killer lures her into the attic by making sounds like the cat. When Mrs. Mac opens the attic door he swings a large hook at her designed to pull things up into the attic crawlspace. The hook impales her under her chin and hangs her. Outside the cabbie becomes impatient and leaves.The extensive search of the park turns up a body: Janice Quaife. Jess rushes back to the house where she receives another frightening phone call from the killer. Again he uses multiple voices and reenacts some weird scenario involving naughty Billy and baby Agnes. This time Jess calls the police to report the obscene phone calls. As she talks to Sgt. Nash a figure approaches her from behind and startles her--it is Peter who has been napping in the house while waiting for Jess to return. Nash does not take Jess's report seriously although Mr. Harrison is sitting near him in the police station and overhears him talking to Jess about the calls. He and Phyl and Chris tell Lt. Fuller about it and Lt. Fuller angrily scolds Nash for being so inept.Meanwhile Peter proposes to Jess. He would like to quit the conservatory and marry Jess and be a father to her child. Jess however refuses. She does not want to get married or have a child yet as she has things she wants to accomplish first. Peter becomes hurt and angry telling Jess that she's talking about killing their baby as if it's like having a wart removed. Jess becomes frightened by his mounting hostility and tells Peter to leave.Just as Peter is walking out Phyl arrives with Lt. Fuller and a phone company rep named Graham who puts a tap on the house phone. Fuller notices that Peter seemed angry and he questions Jess about it. He also looks around Clare's room and asks more questions about her. Graham asks if there is another phone in the house and Fuller tells him that it is a private line belonging to Mrs. Mac and that there have been no obscene phone calls on it so they don't tap it. Fuller tells Jess that he'll be listening in on all of her phone conversations from the station and Graham tells her to keep the caller on the line for as long as possible so that he can trace the call. Fuller has also left an officer in a squad car outside to watch the house.When he leaves Phyl begins crying and tells Jess that she's sure Clare is dead. Tired and emotionally exhausted she goes to bed and Jess waits for another phone call. Meanwhile the killer goes into Barb's room and watches her sleeping. Barb who has asthma suddenly suffers an attack and Jess rushes to her aid with an inhaler. Barb tells her that she had a nightmare about a stranger coming into her room. Barb goes back to sleep and Jess is distracted by a group of Christmas carolers at the front door. The singing masks the sounds of Barb's murder; the killer returns and stabs her to death using a glass ornament near her bed.The carolers are suddenly rushed off by a concerned parent who has just found out about the murder of the little girl in the park. Jess hears the phone ringing and it's the killer. He wails at her in a strange voice and says ""It's just like having a wart removed!"" before hanging up. Jess is shocked; these are words she used in private to Peter. Lt. Fuller picks up on this but Jess denies that it has any significance. Phyl comes back downstairs and Jess tells her about what just happened; Phyl seems to not think the killer could possibly be Peter and neither does Jess but she is not sure. Peter himself calls then and begs Jess not to kill the baby. This conversation doesn't last long enough to trace either but Fuller calls to ask Jess about what they were talking about. Jess admits she's pregnant and that Peter objects to an abortion and Fuller seems to think that Peter could be the caller after all. Jess however has a revelation: Peter was here at the house with her when one of the calls came through so it couldnt be Peter calling. Fuller is still suspicious and he requests Peters records from the Dean of Admissions. He goes to the conservatory and finds the piano violently smashed.Jess is convinced that she can now rule out Peter as a suspect and both she and Phyl are relieved. They have a brief laugh after they are startled by two bumbling men from town who are out looking for the killer. Phyl and Jess go around the house locking all the doors and windows when Phyl goes into Barb's room. Just inside the door someone whispers ""Agnes!"" and the door slams shut. Jess tries to find Phyl but the phone rings; its the killer again. This time Jess keeps him on the phone long enough for Graham to trace the calls--they are coming from 6 Belmont Street the same address as the sorority house itself. Nash radios Fuller with the news and Fuller realizes the calls are coming from the house mother's phone. He tries to radio the policeman parked outside the sorority house but the cop is now dead his throat slit by the killer. Fuller radios Nash and tells him to call Jess and warn her to get out of there without letting on that the killer is in the house with her. Nash of course is unable to do this; when Jess tells him she's going to go upstairs and get Phyl and Barb Nash admits that the calls are coming from inside the sorority house itself.Jess is terrified and she screams out for Phyl and Barb over and over again. The house is silent. Instead of leaving Jess gets a poker from the fireplace and goes upstairs. In Barb's room she finds the bodies of both Phyl and Barb on the bed. From the crack in the door Jess sees the killer's eye watching her. ""Agnes its me Billy! Don't tell what we did!"" he whispers. Jess slams the door on him and runs. Howling in rage and pain the killer chases after her. With no time to unlock the front door Jess heads for the cellar. The killer catches her hair as she passes the stairs but Jess is able to break free and bolt the cellar door behind her just in time. Eventually the maniac stops pounding on the door and Jess hears sounds as if he is going out the front door. Unsure she remains in the cellar. Through the basement windows Jess can see someone prowling around the house. Unable to gain admittance the figure seems to spot Jess in the cellar; it is Peter. He calls out to her but Jess ignores him. Peter breaks a window and enters the basement with her. ""Whats the matter Jess?"" he asks as she approaches her. He will not be dissuaded.Outside Fuller arrives with other policemen close behind and they find the patrolman dead in his car. Hearing Jess screaming from inside the house they break in. By the time they reach the basement they find Jess and Peter lying together; they appear to both be dead but Jess stirs. She has killed Peter with the fire poker.A doctor gives Jess a sedative and she is sleeping although the house is bustling with activity. Fuller unable to question her hypothesizes about the case convinced that Peter was the killer. Mr. Harrison suddenly goes into shock. The doctor intervenes and wants to take Mr. Harrison to the hospital. Chris leaves with them and so do the other police officers leaving Jess alone and unconscious with a guard in front of the house. After they leave the house is silent and the attic door opens. The bodies of Clare and Mrs. Mac are still up there unnoticed by anybody yet. The killer climbs down out of the attic saying ""Agnes its me Billy!"" As the camera slowly pulls away from the house we see the lone police officer on the front porch smoking a cigarette. Suddenly the phone begins to ring just as it did after all the murders that came before.

"On the evening that the Pi Kappa Sigma sorority (which is headed by their house mother the booze swilling Mrs. Mac) is holding their Christmas party the house receives the latest in a string of obscene phone calls from who the girls call ""the moaner"" but who identifies himself as ""Billy"". Some like Jess Bradford don't like the calls others like brash Barb Coard are somewhat amused by the calls others like Phyl Carlson don't think much of them and straight laced Clare Harrison is offended by them. The calls are just the latest trouble for Jess who is pregnant and who doesn't want to tell her sensitive but volatile boyfriend music student Peter Smythe. For this latest call which is a bit more elaborate than those previous Barb decides to make a snide comment in return which provokes a threat by Billy. The next morning one of the girls goes missing. The desk sergeant at the police station doesn't think much about this as a missing person case especially as the police are already dealing with another missing person case (a thirteen year old girl named Janice Quaife). The police don't act until more information is brought to the attention of Lieutenant Kenneth Fuller by Clare's boyfriend Chris Hayden. As Lt. Fuller and his men investigate which includes placing a wire tap on the sorority house phones more and more incidents happen to those living at the sorority house. In addition the obscene calls continue and increasingly have a personal connotation to one of the girls which includes information that could only be known by those involved. Or is there another reason why the caller knows so much about the specific girl in question?::Huggo"

The four then make their way to the living room and listen to Marion play the piano while outside a dirtied grubby man appears roaming around and looking menacingly into the windows.That night Terry and Nancy begin to discuss how weird the family is at the house and Terry finds a tooth under her bed. Nancy then decides to go through the woods and get help while later that night Terry awakes to hear a man masturbating. The next morning someone watches Nancy and Terry take a shower through a peephole in the bathroom wall. At breakfast the two tell Marion they're plan and Marion says it's a good idea telling Terry to go get firewood. Nancy then sets off through the woods while Terry is frightened away from the shed out back by Marion because it's full of loose timbers. Nancy makes it through the thick forest only to be gorily slashed to death by a figure with a long scythe. That night Terry finds that Nancy has not returned and becomes worried but Mrs. Penrose and Marion assure she's probably okay as once again dinner is ruined by Mrs. Penrose's views on men and her daughter. That night Terry once again hears the breathing and goes to see who it is finding an abandoned little kids room with black and white pictures of two little kids and an old tool belt with a dusty gun and machete. She goes back to her room only to see the dirty grubby man outside her window and runs screaming down the stairs into Marion's arms. Marion then calms her down and tells her that the man is her brother Carl who has the fundamental mind of a five year old and who their mother abandoned when she gave up on men. She insists that he is harmless and Terry admits to overreacting and goes back to bed.The next day Terry is once again worried about where Nancy is and Marion assures her that she's probably in town right then. Terry then goes up to see Gloria who has become conscious now and the two begin to discuss on ways to get out of the house while the same person watches through another peep hole in the wall. Terry then goes outside to talk to Norman and asks if he's seen Nancy telling him that she went through the woods only to have Norman freak out and warn her about a couple of girls disappearing in the woods around there. Night comes and someone sneaks into Gloria's room and splits her head open with an axe. Terry goes upstairs and finds Gloria's room empty and asks Marion where she is. Marion tells her she may have went outside for a breath of fresh air so Terry searches for her outside. She calls for Gloria but finds Carl ready to attack her. After Carl chases her to the shed Terry finds the dead bodies of her friends along with several other dismembered corpses. Carl breaks through the window and tries to grab her but she fights back and runs back to the house. After running back to the house and upstairs into the kid's room she takes out the dusty gun and shoots Carl in the head while an alarmed Marion comes running upstairs to find her brother dead with Terry recuperating in front of his corpse. When Marion questions her frantically about killing her brother Terry tells her to go look in the shed to which Marion tells her (in a deep masculine voice) that Carl had nothing to do with what happened in the shed. Terry looks at Marion in shock as Marion pulls out the machete. She realizes that Marion is actually Mrs. Penrose's other son after glimpsing his chest hair. Marion brutally hacks a screaming Terry to death with the machete as he raves about having to pretend to be a girl having to take care of Carl and of how he had to kill all of the girls in the scary deep voice. Once Terry is dead Mrs. Penrose calls for Marion downstairs asking if they had a man up there. Marion covered in blood denies being with a man in the feminine voice.

"[note: this synopsis is only for Mario Bava's true and original Lisa and the Devil (1973) not the re-shot re-edited version 'The House of Exorcism' (1975)]Lisa Reiner (Elke Sommer) is a young American woman vacationing in Spain with some friends of hers. During a stop in a small town square with her tour group Lisa grows to admire a fresco of the devil carrying a dead man's body which her tour guide describes as the devil carrying away lost souls back to Hell. As her group disperses Lisa hears a beautiful piece of music. She leaves her companions and traces its source to an elaborate music box in a little antique shop just outside the main square. While inside the shop she encounters a strange man (Telly Savalas) purchasing parts of a life-size mannequin. After making eye contact Lisa is startled when the man bears an uncanny resemblance to the devil depicted in the painting. The man's peculiar behaviour distresses Lisa so she flees from the shop to rejoin her friends.However she becomes hopelessly lost in the maze of backstreets of the town. Though she has only walked a short distance beforehand the back streets and alleyways seem totally alien to her. The locals refuse to give her directions as side streets lead to dead ends. Lisa runs into the mysterious man a second time though this time he is carrying a full-length life-sized mannequin eerily similar to the painting depicted in the main square as well as carrying the music box still playing the haunting tune. Introducing himself as Leandro he gives Lisa some vague directions back to the main square then walks around a corner and disappears. But the direction that Leandro points to the main square leads only to more unfamiliar streets. Next Lisa encounters a strange man who looks a lot like the mannequin that Leandro was carrying. These bizarre coincidences begin to terrify Lisa and the stranger acts as though she is his long-lost lover. Frantic Lisa pushes him away and the man falls down a flight of stone steps apparently dead. Lisa runs off in a panic.Night falls on the village and Lisa remains lost. However her luck seems to be improving when she hitches a ride in a old vintage 1940s limousine which contains Francis Leher (Eduardo Fajardo) and his wife Sophie (Silvia Koscina) whom are driving through the village with their chauffeur George (Gabriele Tinit). But their limousine soon breaks down just outside a old villa on the town's outskirts. The four travelers push their car into the villa grounds and knock on the front door asking for assistance. The villa turns out to be occupied by an elderly blind countess (Alida Valli) and her neurotic son Maximilian (Alessio Orano). When Maximilian spots Lisa he becomes convinced that she is the reincarnation of a woman that loved and lost. Maximilian implores his mother to allow the four stranded tourists to stay for the night while he helps the chauffeur repair the car's engine. Though the villa is well-appointed it has a strange atmosphere. Lisa is subsequently shocked to discover that Leandro is the family butler who also recognizes her from their brief meetings earlier and seems a little too friendly to Lisa.As Leandro settles Lisa Francis and Sophie and George into their living quarters for the night Lisa jumps with fright when she sees the same man from the village who tried to attack her staring at her through the window. Lisa tries to get away from the house but her departure is thwarted by Maximilian who begs her to stay. As she feels some attraction to the young man as well as pity for him Lisa relents.The four travellers are settled down to dinner while the food is served by Leandro. Lisa further notices the weird atmosphere of the place when Maximilian continues to remind Lisa that she has a resemblance towards his lost lover Elena. But Francis and Sophie's relationship becomes more strained as dinner progresses. Francis' cold dispassionate nature forces Sophie to walk away from him and she falls into the arms of George whom they have quick passionate sex. A short while later George is found dead with a pair of scissors plunged into his throat. Sophie immediately assumes that her husband did it and she flees outside into the car where she starts it up When Francis comes out to stop her from leaving she runs over him over and over again. But upon returning into the house Sophie is killed by Maximilian in a hurtful gory way. It was Maximilian who murdered the chauffeur to prevent Lisa from leaving.With the meddling strangers out of the way Maximilian turns his attention to Lisa where it's revealed that the man who pursued Lisa in the village is actually Maximilian's stepfather Carlos (Espartaco Santoni). Like Maximilian he had previously fallen in love with Elena the woman displayed in a few old photographs who bears an amazing resemblance to Lisa. Carlos had abandoned the countess and ran off with Elena who was also Maximilian's lover. Before she had a chance to join him Maximilian had murdered Elena and stored her body in a concealed room so he could continue to have her even in death. Apparently when Carlos returned to the village he assumed after seeing Lisa that she was Elena. Now that Maximilian had murdered Carlos he puts him display in an open coffin in the parlor so that nobody can take Lisa away from him.At this point Lisa still has no idea that Maximilian is completely deranged and on top of that she's still being casually nice to him. When Maximilian decides to share his secret with Lisa about his lost love Elena he takes her to the concealed room and shows her Elena's skeletal remains Lisa finally then backs away in horror and rejects Maximilian. But rather than kill her he chloroforms Lisa and puts her in the bed next to Elena's remains. Maximilian strips Lisa naked and tries to have sex with the unconscious woman. But in his twisted state of mind he feels that the skeletal remains of Elena is mocking him and he cannot perform. Apparently deciding that in order to consummate the relationship he will have to marry her.Maximilian meets his mother in the parlor who's paying respects to her dead husband where he tells her of his intentions. The Countess jealous of the hold Elena in the form of Lisa continues to hold over the men in her life demands that Maximilian kill Lisa and dispose of her and the rest of the bodies before the police show up looking for her and the other murder victims. But Maximilian's devotion to Lisa is complete and rather then get rid of her he stabs his mother dead as she stands by the coffin that contains Carlos' body.All of these events are observed by Leandro whose presence seem to haunt the villa and who seems to be orchestrating the bizarre occurrences as some kind of sick game. Unsettled by this act of matricide Maximilian rushes about the house looking for Leandro who for once is nowhere to be found. Instead Maximilian finds the bodies of all his victims including the skeletal Elena seated at the dinner table looking at him. He turns around and sees his undead mother shambling towards him. In shock Maximilian recoils backwards only to fall out a second floor window and onto the spikes of a gate. Emerging from behind the body of the dead Countess Leandro remarks ""oh it slipped"".The next morning Lisa wakes up naked and in unfamiliar surroundings. Though it seems to be the exact same concealed room it is now infested with vegetation and she is alone with no bodies anywhere. Putting her clothes back on Lisa walks through the house and finds that its entirely deserted. In fact it looks that nobody has lived in the house for a long time. Confused but somewhat relieved that the entire night's experience was apparently nothing but a bad dream Lisa leaves the house and runs into a group of schoolgirls playing ball in the street. The balls rolls in her direction and she catches it. One of the the girls points to Lisa and proclaims her a ghost because nobody has lived in the villa for a hundred years. The girls run away screaming. Lisa walks around a little and within minutes finds herself back in the town square from the beginning of the movie. She is observed by Leandro a short distance away who is being given a mannequin likeness of her.Lisa takes a taxi to the airport and enters a plane. After the plane takes off Lisa notices the she is the only passenger. She searches section after section only to discover the dead bodies of Maximilian the Countess and all the others in the first class compartment. Frantically Lisa makes her way to the cockpit where she opens the door and discovers that Leandro is the pilot who lets out a devilish laugh. Lisa transforms into a ghastly pale mannequin and slumps to the floor."

Bernadette momentarily feigns death and manages to slug at her unseen attacker and manages to run out of the car. A minute later she sees someone she apparently knows where Bernadette says: ""thank God please help me"". Suddenly the unseen person in black pulls out a straight razor and slashes Bernadette's throat.Sometime later that night at the village inn a group of students are at a table drinking when Virginia (Melissa Sue Anderson) arrives and joins the group with them wondering at why she was so late in meeting them.

She later tells her doctor David Faraday (Glenn Ford) of the eerie recollection. David tells her that after being injured in an accident Virginia had been an experiment. She was able to remember something she had previously forgotten due to a regeneration of her damaged brain. David says that she will remember more later.At a dirt bike race Virginia and her friends are cheering on Etienne who wins the race.

That night as Etienne is cleaning his motorbike in his garage someone approaches him from behind and throws his scarf into the running wheel which pulls his face closer. Then the unseen person revs up the bike letting the wheel do the rest as it mangles Etienne's face.Later at the village inn everyone is awaiting Etienne and Alfred. Virginia and Ann (Tracy Bregman) go to find Alfred to find out what ""evil deeds he has been up to"". They go over to his house and climb through a window into his bedroom and they find Bernadette's severed head on a tray.

She tells David about Rudi and the knife and she panicked and cannot remember anything. David hears about the discovery of a bloody knife at the bell tower and the possibility of foul play. He finds Virginia and tries to persuade her to tell him exactly what happened at the bell tower. Before long Rudi shows up and the skull found in the campus garden is only a joke. The students are assembled later by Mrs. Patterson over this practical joke and Virginia is unsettled and goes to the cemetery again to sit at her mother's grave. She is followed by Alfred who continues to spy on her. But when Alfred gets close Virginia turns around and stabs him to death with a pair of garden sheers.The next morning Virginia's father Hal (Lawrence Dane) is leaving town for a business trip but be promises to be back on Sunday which is Virginia's 18th birthday.

Virginia manages to get out of the car but her mother drowns. In trying to swim to the surface Virginia suffers a severe head injury when she hits her head against the bottom of a barge passing over the submerged car under the bridge. Virginia awakens to a bathroom flooded with water and she sees that Ann is dead in the overflowing bathtub.Frantic Virginia calls Dr. David Faraday who arrives over but when they go into the bathroom Ann's body is no longer there. He tells Virginia that he will stay the night and he eludes the police who show up at Virginia's house looking for the missing Ann. David tells Virginia that she must remember what happened to her the evening before her car accident. In a flashback Virginia remembers that her mother wanted Virginia to have a birthday party at the old guest cottage that sits behind Virginia's house but none of the other students showed up because there was a birthday party at Ann's house. Virginia's mother is angry and she drove with Virginia over to Ann's house and demanded to be let inside. When she is denied access Virginia's mother yells from the front gate: ""I can't be bought off again!""Virginia distressed runs out of the room only to return a minute later with a fireplace poker which she uses to beat David to death. A little later that evening Virginia's father Hal finally comes home and sees blood all over Virginia's bedroom and runs outside looking for his daughter. After finding David's corpse in the bushes the father heads to the cottage in the back of the house and discovers all around a table the dead bodies of all the students Bernadette Etienne Greg Alfred Steve Ann along with the decomposing corpse of Virginia's mother stolen from the grave. Virginia walks into the room with a birthday cake with fully lighted candles and singing ""happy birthday to me"". Virginia blows out the candles and puts a birthday hat on her father as he sits down at the table and sobs. Virginia takes out a large cake knife and offers to cut a slice of cake for him. When Hal does not respond Virginia suddenly slashes his throat.Virginia next walks over to Ann lying face down at the table and lifts up her head. It is actually Virginia at the table wearing Ann's clothes. She awakens looks up and immediately struggles with her evil twin who says: "" I did it all for you sister!"" Virginia eventually grabs the evil Virginia's face... tearing off a latex mask and reveals Ann standing there. Ann tells Virginia that she would drug her and dress up like her and kill people while disguised as Virginia. When Virginia asks Ann ""why"" Ann tells her that Virginia's mother was really Ann's father's mistress (which means that the two of them are really half sisters). Ann tells Virginia that Virginia's mother would not let Ann's father ever forget it. Virginia suddenly turns against Ann for killing all her friends and eventually stabs her. As Ann falls to the floor she tells Virginia that that it doesn't matter if she didn't kill her for she had orchestrated this whole thing to frame Virginia for all the killings. Just as Ann dies a police officer walks in as Virginia is standing there before Ann's dead body holding the bloody cake knife. ""Dear God what have you done?!"" the policeman exclaims. Virginia drops the cake knife and realizes (way too late) that the insane and murderous Ann had indeed gotten her final revenge because it is strongly implied that Virginia will be arrested and get blamed for all the killings that Ann actually did... with no possibility now to prove her innocence.

"The movie opens with text over a red background that reads ""More than a hundred years ago in a mountain village in Switzerland lived a man whose strange experiments with the dead have since become legend. The legend is still told with horror the world over...It is the legend of..."" A clever segway into the title: The Curse of Frankenstein. Credits follow.A man on horseback approaches a prison in the mountains along a narrow pathway. A church bell chimes the hour as a man opens the gate for the rider. He is a priest (Alex Gallier). He is escorted by the Warder (Michael Mulcaster) to see Baron Victor Frankenstein (Peter Cushing). The warder explains that the prisoner is dangerous. The Baron wishes to see the priest because he thinks he can trust the man with his story. He starts his story ""I suppose it was when I was a boy at school. I always had a brilliant intellect. When my mother died I inherited the Frankenstein fortune.""The Young Baron (Melvyn Hayes) is escorting his extended family out of his house after his mother died. His uncle (Raymond Ray) leads the family delegation. Aunt Sophie (Noel Hood) and her daughter young Elizabeth (Sally Walsh) stay behind. Aunt Sophie wants reassurance her allowance will continue uninterrupted. After confirming the money will continue Victor quickly escorts the two relatives out the door. As they are leaving a dapper gentleman in a brown top hat arrives. Paul Krempe (Robert Urquhart) walks into the house and presents himself to the new but very young Baron. He had corresponded with the Baron for a tutor. Initially he thinks there must be some mistake or a joke but Victor explains the tutoring is for himself and he is serious. The two hit it off immediately. After two years ""I learned all he had to teach but we went on together probing into the unknown investigating recording searching always searching until gradually the sweep of our research began to assume a single direction and to this aim we finally turned all our energies. It took us years of unrelenting work to discover what we were seeking."" With chemical and electrical apparatus they were able to restore life to a dead puppy. Paul sees the possibilities of their discovery. He notes ""If we could delay or prolong the period in which the body is apparently dead while the heart is alive wed have a living body with only the barest life-spark present. That what that would mean when it came to performing major surgery!"" Paul wants to write up their findings and present it at a medical conference within a month. Victor expresses his opposition because he wants to experiment further and does not want to share the secret not yet at least. He proposes the next step. Rather than just restore life he wants to create life from the beginning. He tells Paul ""We must build up our own creature and built it up from nothing. We must create a human beinga perfect human."" Paul disagrees ""What you're saying is nonsense a revolt against nature. Such a thing could only end in evil."" Victor persuades Paul to continue the work. He proposes to obtain a body and knows a highwayman was hanged for his crimes and suggests they retrieve it. They take a horse and cart and cut down the body and return it to their lab. Paul notes that half the head has been eaten away. Victor quickly cuts the head off explaining it is of no use. He dumps it into a vat of acid in the storage room next door. They remove the old clothes wrap the body in bandages and place it in a large glass tank. Now Paul voices his objection to the whole exercise ""I don't think we should continue with this."" Victor tells Paul he will be leaving for a while but does not explain where or why.Justine the maid (Valerie Gaunt) carries refreshments into the living room and asks Paul if the Baron has returned. She answers the door expecting that Victor has returned. To her disappointment it is not the Baron but a woman who tells her she was expected and needs help with her luggage. Elizabeth (Hazel Court) is the Baron's cousin and we learn later his fiance. She mistakes Paul for the Baron. Victor arrives home in an excited state calling for Paul. He is not surprised to see Elizabeth. He and Paul rush off to the lab upstairs leaving Elizabeth annoyed and confused.Victor unwraps something from a small black bag. He proudly displays two hands cut off at the wrist. He explains they are Bardello's hands--the hands of the world's greatest sculptor. Paul voices his objection to exposing Elizabeth to the experiment. He tells Victor ""While you were away I decided I could not continue with this experiment."" He tries to convince Victor to stop but he is unsuccessful. Victor remains in the lab and will graft the new hands on by himself. Paul goes downstairs and tries to convince Elizabeth to leave. In this he is also unsuccessful mainly because he will not explain the nature of the experiment or the danger. She explains she is to be Victor's wife.Outside the lab Victor and Justine embrace and kiss. Victor is just toying with the maid. She believes she will be his wife but Victor tells her that Elizabeth is to be his wife. The next morning Victor prepares to leave on another trip. Elizabeth talks to him about the household accounts and possibly assisting in other ways. Victor pays a visit to the Municipal Charnel House and buys a pair of human eyes. Victor takes them home to examine them when Paul asks to see him. He reiterates his refusal to help Victor with his work. Victor proudly shows Paul how far he has gone on his own. Paul turns away from the tank with revulsion and exclaims ""It's horrible!"" Victor tells Paul that once a genius brain is obtained and installed the creature will take on a benevolent face. When asked where the brain will come from Victor replies ""I'll get it.""Victor and Elizabeth are in the living room entertaining a visitor. Professor Bernstein (Paul Hardtmuth) accepted an invitation from the Baron for dinner and to spend the night. The professor tells Victor that discoveries can be mishandled. Paul enters the room and is introduced to the distinguished professor. Victor escorts the old man upstairs to his room. At the top of the stairs Victor shows him a painting maneuvering the old man closer to the bannister which gives way. Victor pushes the old man through and down to his death. Professor Bernstein is given a burial at the Baron's expense and in his family vault. Later that evening the Baron retrieves Bernstein's brain. He carefully places the jar in his bag and prepares to leave the vault. Paul arrives expecting to find Victor and accuses him of murder. Paul intends to stop Victor from using the brain and tells him so. They briefly struggle over the bag and the jar is broken.Paul calls on Elizabeth in her room and again begs her to leave. He explains he only stays to ensure her safety. In the lab Victor is picking pieces of glass out of the brain trying to salvage it. He puts the brain into the skull and prepares to revive his newly finished creature. He starts the chemical and electrical equipment as an electrical storm brews outside. Paul is upstairs in his room preparing for bed. As the tank empties Victor goes to Paul's room and again asks for help. He admits ""That apparatus was constructed for dual operation. You know that. I thought I could work it myself but I can't."" But Paul gleefully replies ""I'm delighted."" A lightning bolt starts the electrical components and the body in the empty tank begins to breathe. Victor promises that after the experiment is completed he will dispose of the body. Paul reluctantly agrees to help. Victor returns to the lab and hears glass breaking. He unlocks the lab door and standing there is the creature. It pulls away the bandages covering its head to reveal a scarred and hideous face (Christopher Lee). One eye is blue the other brown and it stares at its creator with hate. It grabs Victor and chokes him. Only Paul's quick action saves Victor. He breaks a chair over the thing's head. The creature stumbles and falls to the floor. Paul demands the creature be destroyed as Victor straps it down to a table. Victor tells Paul he will operate on the brain the next morning and try to correct its homicidal tendencies. But the next morning the lab is a shambles and the window broken. The creature has broken free and escaped.Victor and Paul search the countryside for the creature. An old blind man (Fred Johnson) and his grandson (Claude Kingston) are out in the woods for a stroll. The old man sits and the grandson goes down to the lake shore to pick mushrooms. The creature encounters the old man. After a brief exchange he kills the old man. The grandson returns to where he left his grandfather. Victor and Paul find signs and follow it into the woods. They find it and Paul shoots the creature through the eye. The creature falls and is pronounced dead. They bury it in place and return to the house.Paul goes to the lab and tells Victor he is leaving. With the creature dead he no longer needs to stay and protect Elizabeth. But Paul doesn't know Victor dug his creation up and returned its lifeless body back to the lab. Victor stares at his creature hanging in the store room and promises ""I'll give you life again."" Victor is dressed and tells Justine she can serve dinner. Justine reminds Victor of his promise to marry her. Her trump card is the revelation she is pregnant with his child. He does not believe he is the father but Justine informs the master that Elizabeth will believe her. She adds that she will go to the authorities regarding the experiment. He fires the maid and orders that she leave the next morning. That night Justine goes up to the lab to get the proof she will need for the authorities. Victor leaves the lab door unlocked and Justine enters for a look. She enters the storage room and finds the revived creature. When she tries to flee Victor locks her in knowing his homicidal creation will kill her. It does.A week later Victor and Elizabeth are having breakfast. Elizabeth inquires about Justine. Victor lies and tells her ""I expect some village lothario eloped with her."" They discuss the wedding plans. Elizabeth reveals she invited Paul. Instead of being angry Victor casually informs her he hopes Paul comes. He says that he has something to show Paul.It is the eve of the wedding and a reception at the Baron's home is underway. The Burgomaster (Andrew Leigh) is enjoying the laced punch and practicing his speech. His wife (Ann Blake) reproaches her drunk husband and they leave for home. When all the guests have left Victor announces he will be working in the lab. Elizabeth is disappointed and tells her future husband. Paul does not attend the reception but does come later that evening. Elizabeth tells Paul to go surprise Victor. Victor is preparing a plate of flood when Paul knocks on the lab door. Victor invites his old tutor into the lab. He leads him to the storage room. Paul is shocked to discover the creature chained to the wall and showing signs of brain surgery. Victor orders the creature onto its feet. It struggles but stands then sits when ordered. Paul chides the Baron about the creature's lack of perfection but Victor reminds Paul ""There you see the result of your handiwork as much as mine...but you damaged it. You put a bullet in the wretched thing. This is your fault Paul."" Paul exits the lab promising to go to the authorities and have them destroy the creature. Victor chases after him. He leaves the lab door unlocked and Elizabeth enters the lab. The creature breaks its chains. Elizabeth enters the storage room and sees the vat of acid. The creature gets out onto the roof. Victor and Paul see it and Paul goes to the village for help. Elizabeth goes outside to explore a noise she heard. Victor grabs a pistol and goes out to the roof. Firing at the creature he hits Elizabeth then the creature. Only wounded the creature approaches Victor. A well-aimed toss of an oil lamp sets the creature ablaze. The creature falls through the skylight and straight into the acid filled vat below.We return to the prison and the priest still listening to the story now finished. Victor concludes ""My life's work destroyed. Destroyed in a moment. And by the same hand that gave it life."" Paul comes to visit Victor at the prison. Elizabeth was only wounded and recovers. She is also at the prison but stays in the waiting area. Victor begs Paul to tell the priest about the creature and to verify the story but Paul denies it. He does accuse Victor of murdering Justine. Victor claims it was the creature who murdered the maid. The priest leaves the cell. Victor tries to kill Paul but the jailer prevents it. Paul leaves the cell and returns to talk to Elizabeth. He takes her home. Victor is led to his execution. The last scene is of a guillotine seen in silhouette and the credits roll."

"In the Kushiata region of 1840 Kyoto Japan a man and woman meet in a darkened house and fondle a small figurine of two lovers in a passionate embrace. As the man and woman make love an older man arrives at the house and sees the lovers' silhouettes through the screen wall. Enraged he slices through the barrier with his katana sword destroying the room; he then chops off the younger man's head stabs the woman and kills himself. A storm blows the figurine into the rubble and encases the house in darkness.In contemporary Japan an American diplomat named Alex goes to the airport to meet his two friends Ted and Laura and their young daughter Amy who have moved to Japan for Ted's job as a writer.

At the house the family admires their spacious new home and Alex says goodbye.That night the light in Laura's room repeatedly turns off automatically but Ted blames a faulty switch. Later Ted awakens to see three blue ghostly figures in the doorway which disappear when he turns on the light. He and Laura make love. The next morning a Zen monk arrives to warn Ted that the house contains dark spirits; he advises Ted to visit him at the temple should any problems arise.Meanwhile Laura finds the figurine lodged under the stairs and shows it to her husband who identifies it as a netsuke carving. While the couple talks the female ghost walks into Laura's body. Laura asks Ted why Alex never married and makes a suggestive remark about her feelings toward their friend. As Laura feels the spirit leave her body she apologizes for her offhand comment.Later at a street festival in Tokyo Japan Ted takes photographs of a woman he sees through his lens but when he lowers the camera from his face she disappears.Meanwhile Alex telephones Laura to invite her and Ted to a party; the female ghost possesses Laura again and she insists Alex come to visit her at the house. When Ted develops the photographs the woman is missing from the frame.

She reveals her name to be Otami but quickly changes back into Wakako.At the house the next morning the sink faucet turns on automatically causing Laura to become anxious. While she and Amy go shopping the female ghost awakens Ted. Later the older male ghost stabs his sword into Ted's desk and the ghostly blue weapon turns to metal. Frightened Ted visits the monk who says that many years earlier a young girl named Otami fell in love with Masanori a samurai student of her husband Shugoro. The monk explains the rest as Shugoro killed Masanori and Otami before killing himself.When Laura and Amy return home Ted admires the demonic masks they purchased but yells at his wife for spending so much money. He apologizes however and they embrace. During dinner Amy sees a ghostly blue face in her soup and refuses to eat.

Sometime later the Zen monk explains that Amy swallowed the ghost's soul when she drank the soup and instructs the family to return home the next day. He performs a ritual scattering powder throughout the rooms and chasing the three ghosts outside. Laura cries crouched in the corner of the room. The Zen monk tells Ted and Laura that the ghosts are gone but not to let anyone inside the house until morning when he will return to exorcise the house to cleanse it of evil once and for all.Once the monk leaves a guilt-ridden Laura tells Ted about her sexual tryst with Alex. Ted reacts very badly and responds by hitting Laura. Just then Alex enters the house and unknowingly lets the three ghosts inside with him. Ted then punches Alex and the two men fight. As Otami possesses Laura Shugoro enters Ted's body improving his fighting skills. Finally the ghosts motivation for creating all this mischief and mayhem becomes known: they have been plotting to reenact the tragic encounter in order to pass on to the afterlife.

"Jennifer Hills (Camille Keaton) is a short story writer who drives out of her home in New York City to an isolated cottage by a lake in the countryside of upstate New York to write her first novel. The arrival in town of the attractive and independent young woman attracts the attention of Johnny (Eron Tabor) the local gas station owner and his two friends Stanley (Anthony Nichols) and Andy (Gunter Kleemann) two unemployed youths who hang around the gas station. Jennifer receives a grocery delivery from Matthew (Richard Pace) the local simpleton who is shy and apparently mentally retarded and befriends him. Matthew is friends with the other three men and reports back to them about the beautiful woman he met claiming he saw her breasts.The next day Stanley and Andy start cruising by the cottage in their speedboat and surreptitiously prowl around the house at night while keeping themselves hidden from view. One day while Jennifer is relaxing in her canoe they surprise her in their speedboat and tow her to shore. As she tries to escape she's met by Johnny while Matthew hides in bushes nearby. She realizes they planned her abduction so Matthew can lose his virginity. Jennifer puts up a fight by punching Johnny but is chased by the men through the forest. Matthew refuses to have sex with her so Johnny rips off Jennifer's bikini and rapes her. They allow her to escape but track her down shortly afterward and Andy brutally rapes her anally. Matthew again refuses to participate. The four guys flee from the scene of the crime in their speedboat.A little later after Jennifer crawls back to her house they attack her again. Matthew finally rapes her after drinking alcohol but says that he can not reach orgasm with the other men watching. The other men ridicule her book and rip up the manuscript and Stanley sexually assaults Jennifer and rapes her too. When Jennifer scratches at Stanley's face she is savagely beaten. She passes out on the floor covered in mud from the woods as well as her own blood. With that the men leave the house. Johnny realizes she is a witness to their crimes and orders Matthew to go back and stab her to death. Matthew cannot bring himself to do it so he dabs the knife in her blood and returns to the other men claiming he has killed her. The four then take off in their speedboat.Over the next two weeks a traumatized Jennifer pieces both herself and her manuscript back together. She silently sits around her house chain-smoking and avoids looking into mirrors to avoid seeing her maimed face now sporting some permanent scars and ugly bruises from her beating. She goes to a church and asks for forgiveness vowing to kill all four of the men who violated her. One day the men learn Jennifer has survived and they beat Matthew up for lying to them about killing her.Jennifer then begins spying on her assailants first by following Matthew home from the local grocery store to his parents house and the next day she follows Johnny home from the garage to his house where he has a wife and two young children.One day Jennifer calls in a grocery order knowing Matthew will deliver it. Hearing that it's from Jennifer's address he takes the groceries and a knife he steals from the grocery store butcher unsure of what Jennifer plans to do with him. At the cabin Matthew arrives where Jennifer entices him to have sex with her under a tree. As he becomes oblivious to his surroundings she strings a noose around his neck and hangs him. Matthews struggles but is slowly strangled to death as Jennifer watches with a wicked-looking facial expression. Jennifer cuts the rope and drops the dead body in the river. She then pushes his bicycle into the river and the groceries he brought as well. Jennifer then phones the grocery store to report that Matthew never arrived with her order.The next day Jennifer drives over to the gas station and seductively collects Johnny from the place and entices him to join her in her car. She stops on the road halfway to her house where she gets out of the car and points a gun at him ordering that he remove all his clothing. The clearly misogynist Johnny insists the rapes were her fault because she enticed the men by parading around in revealing clothing. She feigns belief in Johnny's ludicrous rant lowers her gun and invites him back to her cottage for a hot bath.While taking a bath together Jennifer manually stimulates him in her bathtub. When Johnny says that Matthew has been reported missing Jennifer says she killed Matthew. Johnny thinks she is joking. As he nears orgasm Jennifer takes the butcher knife Matthew brought with him from its hiding place under the bathmat and severs Johnny's genitals. He screams in terror while bleeding to death. Jennifer calmly drops the knife in the bathroom sink leaves the room and locks Johnny in from the outside. He dies from blood loss. Jennifer dumps Johnny's dead body in the basement and burns his clothes in the fireplace.The following day Stanley and Andy learn that Johnny is missing from his wife. They take their speedboat to Jennifer's cabin aware that she might have killed him and Matthew. Andy goes ashore with an axe looking for Jennifer while she swims out to the boat and climbs aboard before Stanley realizes what she is doing. She pushes him overboard and Stanley has trouble staying afloat for he is not a good swimmer. Andy tries to attack her when she speeds past him in the boat but she escapes with the axe. Andy swims out to rescue Stanley but Jennifer plunges the axe into Andy's back killing him. She backs the boat up to Stanley who grabs hold of the motor to climb aboard begging Jennifer not to kill him. Looking down on her former assailant with very cold eyes Jennifer instead smirks at Stanley and quotes what he said while assaulting her: ""Suck it bitch!"" and starts the engine disemboweling him underwater. As Andy and Stanley's dead bodies sink beneath the surface of the water the murderous Jennifer smiles slightly as she speeds away in the boat.

"Also known as The Edge of Terror. This was the title on the screen of the version I saw.Sian Anderson (Meg Foster)'s voice is retelling the story of Pinocchio and Jesus Christ. The camera pans over a Hollywood mansion and its swimming-pool. It's a ridiculous joke that she is telling to his lover John (David McCallum) a 40-something still attractive wealthy man. They are hugging after sex. He complains that he is not one of the heroes in his novelso that he can only have sex once every night. She says that he will have time to rest afterwards during the weekend as she is flying away.Suddenlythere is the noise of a helicopter or something like that getting close. She wonders what that noise is about. He undraws the curtains electronically showing her a flying announcement saying ""Bon voyage"".Sian is telling this story to somebody else one of her girlfriends (Summer Thomas). The friend feels jealousbut Sian says that he is perfect but that she wants freedom and a different man every night. The friend thinks that Sian will have lots of sexual adventures during her holidays but Sian says that she needs to work in her following novel. Awkward moment of another girlfriend I guess wearing a skimpy Baywatch-like red swimsuit who smiles and sits down and the same poolside table and Sian and friend. Her wealthy boyfriends sees her off in a limo saying that he will miss her. Sian is skeptical though. He mentions that many people think that she has ""huevos"" like a man but she says that that is only because she uses a male pseudonym in her books. At that moment Carol his secretary calls him. He also worries about Sian getting on well with her landlord Elias Appleby (Robert Morley) because he doesn't have a very English-sounding name so that they may have misunderstandings. But Sian is confident she can get well with him. Finally he asks her to phone him often but she says a non-committal ""I will call you when I miss you."" Sian says that she will spend the night with her friend Jane and the next day she will go to Monemvasia. He can't pronounce that name.A Greek-looking village by the sea in an island. The landlord mentions that historically Monemvasia has been an isolated place although at its peal 60000 people used to live there. The name of the town Monemvasia means ""single entrance"" according to wikipedia.org which has helped to keep it isolated. Elias is an idiot saying that he is sorry that Sian has to carry her own luggage across the stone-paved street of Monemvasia but then he moves onto saying that if women want to be liberated they had to do without pleasantries and then he adds he's too old anyway - he is carrying a walking stick. Sian says that it's not problem for her. Elias hasn't heard her as he is a bit deaf and only carries a hearing aid on his right ear. Elias says that he married a Greek woman and that Greek women never complain. He also adds that she never learnt English and he never learnt Greek so that they can't communicate but they can't argue as well which is a good thing as he believes like Homer Simpson that too much communication. She says that he may be right and he stops and states that he is always right. He shows her a 1700-year-old building. Then he says that he had an orgasm when he saw the house for the first time. He tells her that he bought the house for cheap and then asks her whether she believes in ghosts. She says that she has never seen any. Neither has he but he sometimes feels that history is watching him when he approaches that house. The breeze opens and closes the shuts of a window in the background. Finally they enter the house. It is very messy. Elias mentions that he doesn't usually rent the house to strangers but that the agency has spoken well of Sian and her books - which he has never read. Elias says that Phil (Wings Hauser) should have tidy everything up but that he is going to speak with him so that he does it now. She asks where everybody is and he says that there are only farmers in Monemvasia but that they migrate to Switzerland all year to work and only come back in the summer because of the tourists. There is a corridor through which he cannot walk because he is too fat - although he is not that fat. Sian looks at the black-and-white photographs of a woman - it's Elias' wife (Dina Giannakou) who used to be an actress.Elias will sleep in the village because he doesn't like driving after dark but the next day he'll come back to his life in the city. He is going to leave but mentions the wind which is capricious: it may be a hurricane or a slight breeze. He advises Sian not to stroll during the night tells her that in wardrobes there are only personal belongings like his son's hunting shotguns He finally leaves. She has found him annoying although she smiles and is nice to his face.Unpacking she notices a man hiding behind a corner. Five seconds later he is not there. She goes to the terrace to feel the breeze and the salty air. There is a cliff right underneath her terrace.Sian calls John. She says that when she is not working in her next crime novel she will speak to herself as she usually does. John offers to go and call on her once in a while but Sian prefers that he won't. She feels tired but rejoices at her loneliness. She gives him her phone number 22608. He promises to call her later on but the call gets cut off by the wind. All the windows crack and slam.This noise doesn't prevent Sian to start writing in her typewriter. She hears a knock in the doorbut there is nobody there. Somebody has left what looks like shopping bags. She looks around while the wind blows up the dust in the unkempt streets. We can hear a man's laugh and the back of that man going away. Sian walks around the village but it looks like there is not anybody.Phil just comes in chewing gum and being a moron.He says that he only wants to make sure that she saw the shopping. Mr Appleby had told Sian that Phil was American and he says that he is so but he has lived in France Nicaragua and many other countries. Phil says that Elias calls him names and Sian says that Elias is only nice to her because she is paying him a lot of money. He says that if she needs any help he is living in the house next to hers.The breeze becomes a gale. Sian is not scared of the noisesthe crack and crackings. She reads aloud what she has just written and then writes some more. She is describing somebody killing an old man with a poker. That happens when Mr Appleby fires Phil with a torrent of abuse. Phil says that he has nowhere to go and kills Elias with a poker. He buries her.Sian hears the digging noise. Phil realises the turned-on light on Sian's window. Sian has to push herself against the wind to leave her house. She goes to the digged-out area with a torchlight. A scarecrow falls on top of her. She falls to the ground touches Elias's hand. She is sure it is his hand because of a huge blue ring she had noticed before. She runs back to her house but the door is closed.She can't push it open so she goes to a ground storey window and is about to break it with a stone. However Phil shows up at that moment and gives her her house keys.Back home Sian tries to speak with Elias' wife but she doesn't understand. Finally she tells what has happened to John.The line goes silent so he tries to phone her back but he doesn't know the province code - apparently this works like the old system in many other countries - that you only need to know the whole province code if they were calling from outside that province. John threatens with calling the local police. Meanwhile Sian goes back to correcting and reading her novel while smoking. Somebody is trying to open the door. Sian runs to the kitchen door but it's too late - Phil is already in. Phil says he is sorry about scaring her again and tells her that the wind has cut the phone lines and admonishes that the power can go out as well.Sian says thank you and Phil leaves giving Sian her key. Sian is putting on her sneakers wondering why Philhas given her the key if he has killed Elias. She wonders if he knows that she knows. Sian realises that the power may truly come off if something happens to the generator. She prepares candles and turns them on even though there is still light.Phil picks up a scythe. He has also problems to move around because of the wind. Sian gets to the generator first locking the door after her. Finally Phil goes Bernese and attacks Sian who locks a basement door. Sian throws something on Phil's eyes through the holes that he has created on the door. At this point Phil is playing with the generator. All the opposite there is too much power on the line and light-bulbs explode.Sian starts a fire in the fireplace.Elias' wife felt nervous enough to visit the village herself. She was taken there by two young men. She walks on her own among the dark and the dizzying blaze.Phil calls Sian pretending that nothing is happening. Phil says that he is not crazy that he has killed Elias but it was self-defense. He also admits that he likes her.She tells her to rot in hell and hangs up.He says to the phone ""I don't want to hurt you."" but then he wonders aloud ""why do they force me to kill?"".The wife arrives and enters the house calling out for Elias. Phil kills her with the scythe. Sian looks at Phil running around and tries the phone again. She picks up a huge carving knife from the kitchen. She goes to phone from Phil's house. Phil comes back and closes the door of his house. Phil walks around with the scythe. John is swimming comfortably. He goes for the operators' numbers. Apparently he is speaking with two call centre people. He is about to give Sian the numbers but she stares at Phil who is hollering at the window of Sian's house saying that the wind has died and that she will die as well. Sian hangs up and hides in another room when Phil comes back. She makes a noise because in that room Phil has put the body of Elias' wife. Phil hears her but he is not sure of where she is. Suddenlya mop falls on top of Sian who screams and leaves running through the main door. Phil goes after her.There is a gale outside again. Both Phil and Sian have to push against the windbut Phil cannot get to Sian in time. Sian locks herself in the house again.Andros (Mihalis Giannatos) is the local policeman.He speaks with John in English. Kesner (Steve Railsback) is a stranded sailor because of bad weather. Kesner offers to forget about the money Andros sows him if he gets his passport back. He intends to see Elias' wife. Andros says that however goes to the village with that wind is suicidal.Sian boils water to throw to Phil who is trying to break a window with his scythe.Kesner knocks on Sian's door. Sian refuses to open the door. Sian is waiting for him with the knife. Kesner speaks to her. Now the phone is working. Kesner seems to think that the writer is making it all up. Kesner wants to take a look around the house although Sian would rather leave. She puts a new light-bulb as Kesner has told her to. There is a noise but Kesner doesn't reply. Then he screams. He scares her when he goes up to the house again - the generator had so many loose cables that he could have been killed. Both go to see the corpses at Phil's house. Kesner has a gun and opens the room shooting the lockbut there is no body. Phil sees the scarecrow and jokes that Elias has a good look tonight.He digsbut there is only rubbish bags. Kesner will finally take Sian away. He tells her to make her luggage. He has never liked Phil anyway even when he once advised him to be more ambitious and to have more goals in life. Kesner will take the risk of taking Sian back to the police office.They are speaking when Phil stabs Kesner with his scythe.Sian goes to fetch the carving knife again. She goes back to the room again having seen the shoes of somebody behind the curtainbut it is the dead bodies of Elias and his wife again. She steps back crying when she overhears a noise. Music blares from her room. She turns off the music. Phil picks up his scythe again.Phil asks her not to die in silence.Phil shows himself. Sian runs up the stairs. Phil trips her and grabs her ankle. She runs away. Phil applies a red-hot knife to his wound. He reads parts of Sian's manuscript but deems it too bad. He stops playing with the red apples and says aloud that the party is over. Phil phones Sian saying that she is very intelligent.At this moment Sian remembers what Elias had said about the hunting guns of his son. He picks a shotgun up. On of her characters Fabiani has used it in one of her former novels. She only has four attempts. So she fails three times the last one hitting a plant pot.Phil has a knife stabbed on his chest but he climbs to the roof anyway. Sian hears him crawling on the roof.Sian takes a painting from the wall ties a rope around the nail which was holding it and prepares a booby trap. Phil is finally inside the house. When he jumps in he is shot in his stomach.Sian weeps. She leaves.A couple of newlyweds (John Michaels and Tracy Young) are arguing because they got lost the village looks like a ghost town and there is not even a phone booth on sight.Sian stumbles around in the dark. She falls in a natural cave/hole and sees a skeleton.The couple argue some more. She says that it is 6 in the morning and that everybody must be sleeping. With the dawn an Orthodox priest is sounding the bell. Finally Sian sees the newlywed couple who leave with their tins and cans making noise on tow. They don't hear Sian shouting for help.It is not an Orthodox priest; it's Phil who is still alive and runs after Sian. Phil is supposed to be badly-hurt but he runs as though he were in perfect health. They approach the shore. They both get close to the sea. Sian trips and stays in a ball in a corner.Phil is about to kill her with the scythe but for no reason he looks as if somebody has stabbed him in the back and for no reason at all he falls down the cliff into the sea.Last shot of a still distraught Sian in her corner."

"Aerobics dance instructor Valerie arrives home and checks her answering machine to learn that she has gotten a modeling job for the cover of a magazine. She heads to the Second Sun tanning salon for some tanning but her tanning bed short circuits and flames burn her.At Rhonda's Work-Out the owner and manager Rhonda Johnson (Marica Karr) is teaching Jaimy's (Teresa Vander Woude) class. Afterwords Jimmy (Fritz Matthews) asks Rhonda out on a date and she turns him down. Rhonda then angrily tells Jaimy to stop arriving late. In the women's locker room Rachel (Teresa Truesdale) stays in the showers after everyone else leaves and the lights are suddenly turned off. An unseen person wearing all black clothing enters and stabs Rhonda to death with a large safety pin. Jaimy almost walks into the locker room but decides to go into the men's locker room where she checks out the jockstraps. Rhonda walks in and laughs at Jaimy. Jaimy then goes into the women's locker room to clean up. After being frightened by an artificial arm falling from one locker she is startled by Rachel's dead body falling from another.LAPD officers soon arrive and investigate the scene. The detective in charge of the investigation Lieutenant Morgan (David James Campbell) finds a bloody knitting needle inside the locker-coffin. He goes to Rhonda and Jaimy and asks them about Diane Matthews who's locker was the storage area of the corpse.The next day a couple of weightlifters are talking about Rachel's murder but they quickly shut up when Rhonda scolds them. Rhonda next tells Jaimy to teach her class and stop ""showing off"". Rhonda finds Chuck Dawson (Ted Prior) in her office looking through her files. He says that Rhonda's ""senior partner"" Mr. Erickson has hired Chuck.Outside Jimmy tells Chuck to stay away from Rhonda and the two men fight. Debbie clearly impressed by Chuck's combat skills offers the man a ride and they drive to Debbie's house where Chuck asks for Jimmy's home address. While Debbie is inside Chuck calls Mr. Erickson and tells him he is ""working on it"". Debbie gives Chuck the address and the two of them kiss.A little later Jimmy is watching some aerobics classes as Diane (Laurel Monk) eyes him. She asks him out and Jimmy declines. Diane walks home and she is followed by someone in a car (who checks on a gun in the glove compartment). Diane gets home and Morgan is outside by his own car. He knocks on her door but she backs away too frightened to answer. However the unseen killer is inside. Diane is stabbed to death with the large safety pin. Morgan bursts inside as the killer jumps out a window and runs away. The lieutenant returns to his car to report it and he is told that the knitting needle belonged to Diane but is not the murder weapon a fact which Morgan recently surmised.The next day Rhonda is surprised by Jimmy showing up at the gym. He tells her: ""Just relax I'm not some kind of crazy killer.""That evening Debbie Marsha and Curtis deface the gym's front windows with spray paint (painting ""Aerobicide"" and ""Death Spa"") and they run away. While in the back of the gym Curtis is attacked and stabbed in the neck by the killer with a large knife. Marsha goes looking for him when the killer grabs her too and slices her throat open. Debbie finds Curtis' dead body and runs back to her car. The killer jumps on top of the convertible roof and stabs through the fabric roof until one blow finally hits Debbie and kills her.The unseen killer returns to the gym where a weight lifter is working on a weight machine that has been loosened and he is hit and falls to the floor. The killer is waiting to whack him in the face with a weight. The man's weightlifting friend finds him dead and he too is subsequently stabbed in the head with the pin. Tommy walks in and finds both men dead. Jaimy sees him by the bodies and screams. Chuck runs in and mistakenly thinking that Tommy is the killer beats him up. Later the police arrive and take the two latest dead victims away. Lt. Morgan mentions the coincidence that Chuck began work at soon as the killing started and that he ""took Tommy out like a pro"". Tommy in handcuffs and waiting alone in the mens locker room is also murdered by the real killer. His body is taken away too as one of the paramedics says: ""See you tomorrow Lieutenant."" Morgan tells Chuck that things have ""picked up"" sine has been there.The next morning Morgan visits Rhonda in her office and after pointing out that she seems ""handy"" with a letter opener. He tells her he has several suspects but needs a motive. Meanwhile Chuck snoops around Jimmy's house and discovers an assortment of guns as well as many pictures of Rhonda. Later goes to Rhonda's place here Jimmy starts another fistfight with him. Chuck is finally kicked into the swimming pool and Jimmy leaves. Chuck comes around in Rhonda's house and Morgan is there. The police lieutenant says that he knows that Chuck is really a private investigator and Chuck tells him that he was hired by Mr. Erickson and tells him about Jimmy's place and his locker. Earlier Rhonda had asked Chuck at what kind of pictures he had. Morgan tells Chuck to get out of town and leave the investigation of Rhonda and of her connection to the murders to the police.Cathy cleans out her locker and tells Rhonda that she is leaving. She goes to say good-bye to Jaimy and finds her dead. Cathy runs but the still unseen killer catches her. Later Officer Peterson arrives and finds both women dead. Morgan then gets a call from some who has made a background check on Rhonda.Chuck is leaving from the back of the gym when Jimmy runs him down with his car. Jimmy gets out and finishes Chuck off by stabbing him with a knife.Morgan then goes to see Rhonda (who has just put on a wig over her scarred bald head). Morgan tells her that he made a background check on her and knows that she is formerly Valerie (the aerobics instructor from the opening scene who was burned at the tanning salon five years ago). Morgan then arrests her thinking that she killed all those people out of jealousy that they were beautiful to her while she is forced to hide her burn scars over her layers of clothing. In the car on their way to the station Morgan is informed that Chuck was killed and witnesses saw Jimmy do it.Morgan chases Jimmy down and he says he knows that he did not kill anybody suggesting that Rhonda did it all. Jimmy hits the officer leaving to see Rhonda. He turns the lights on in the locker room and reacts to Rhonda's nude badly burnt body. She gets a gun out of her locker and shoots him. Dying Jimmy tells Rhonda that he loves her and did not want to see her get caught. Rhonda thanks him and then finished him off by shooting him again.A few days later Morgan takes Rhonda to a secluded area. He tells her about his law enforcing father and the mysterious disappearance of a guilty man who the courts let go on a legal technicality. Morgan gets out his gun and points it at Rhonda aware that she really did kill all those 12 people and that Jimmy protected her out of love. Morgan points out that he would be ""crossing the line"" by killing her in a cold-blooded vigilante murder but that it must be done. He forces her to dig a hole in the ground as her own grave. Rhonda quickly grabs the shovel and pounds the lieutenant on his head killing him. She then buries his body in the freshly dug grave.In the final scene a few days later Rhonda is back in her office at her workout gym where her new assistant reads to her the latest advertisement for Rhonda's Work Out and is assured that the gym will be ""packed with gorgeous bodies."" Rhonda tells her that she is counting on it. When she is alone Rhonda brings out from her desk her key chain... which has the large safety pin on it."

"The movie opens with the Bel-Air production logo followed by the title and credits shown over a stone tablet of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs and then dissolves into a map of Egypt with the British Flag flying. We are in Cairo in the year 1902 at a British military outpost. A man explains to Colonel Cross (Ralph Clanton) that his soldiers were attacked by the local people. A riot is underway outside and a rock crashes through the window and lands on the Colonel's desk. Captain Storm (Mark Dana) reports to the Colonel for a new assignment. He is to go south to the Valley of the Kings with a very small contingent to rescue an archeological expedition. To add to his challenge he is to take the wife of the expedition's leader along. It seems that this dig went out without Egyptian approval and the authorities are concerned the locals may attack and kill the members of the dig. The planned route is the long way because it is safer.The rescue party on horseback crosses the desert. Leading the group is Capt. Storm followed by Sylvia Quentin (Diane Brewster). The third in line is Sgt. Gromley (Richard Peel) followed by a man with a beard Sgt. Smolett (Terence de Marney). They stop at an oasis for water and to rest. Storm turns on the charm and explains how things are done to Mrs. Quentin. Sylvia assures Storm she is accustomed to hardship. The group beds down for the evening in a brushy area of the desert. This gives Sylvia and Storm a chance to get better acquainted. Sylvia is perceptive and tells Storm he must have had one woman immune to his charms. The horses get spooked and Storm investigates. Gromley and Smolett join the captain armed and ready for the intruder. Storm sees a woman alone approach their fire. Simira (Ziva Rodann as Ziva Shapir) explains that she is alone and she is not lost. She was drawn by the light of their fire. She declines the food and water offered and explains she is traveling to find her brother Numar who is helping the expedition with the tomb of Rahateb. Simira knows her brother is with them and warns ""You must hurry before it is too late."" She offers to lead them on a more direct route but Storm is reluctant to trust this stranger. They allow her to join them but on the longer safer route. The rescue party goes to bed and Simira reclines in the nearest tree.The next morning Gromley rouses Smolet who is supposed to be on guard. He notices one of the mules Mabel is missing. She was carrying the food. They search but there are no hoof prints. They continue south. Simira walks behind the horses. Storm calls a halt and tries to convince Simira to ride one of the pack animals but she again declines the offer. She tells Storm ""I do not tire Captain. The desert is my strength. You had better keep the animals for yourselves."" Gromley checks the water container and finds it empty. He blames his colleague Smolet but also grows more suspicious of the stranger in their camp. Simira rubs a cat charm on a necklace around her neck.That evening as the party gets sleep a scorpion steals into camp. It stings Sylvia on the arm. When Storm calls for the medical kit Gromley discovers the kit is missing along with Simira. Storm uses a knife to cut Sylvias arm and he sucks out the poison. He uses the makeshift tourniquet to bandage the wound.The next morning Simira wanders back into camp. She claims she went the short way and reached the pass. Storm tells her Sylvia was stung by a scorpion. Simira insists they take the short route if Sylvia is to survive. Storm agrees to the change in routing but promises Simira if it is a trap he will kill her first.At the tomb Walter Andrews (Ben Wright) reads the cartouche ""Let ye who seeks to disturb the eternal peace and sleep of the high priest beware. Flesh of my flesh shall creep into thy body and eat of the flesh of thy spirit until such time as he shall return into the pit of everlasting darkness which he lived before life."" The expedition leader Robert Quentin (George Neise) orders the seal on the sarcophagus be broken. Andrews warns against desecrating the tomb. Quentin asks the opinion of Hans Brecht (Kurt Katch). Brecht replies ""It is what we came for."" Next he asks Claude Beauchamp (Robert Fortin). The little French alcoholic indifferently answers ""What does it matter what I think Robert. You will do what you want anyway."" Beauchamp continues his sketches of the tomb. Quentin turns last to Dr. Michael Farraday (Guy Prescott). Farraday replies hes a man of science and he doesn't know much about superstition. Quentin stares at Numar (Alvaro Guillot) as if to ask his opinion thinks better of asking a native and then cuts open the seal on the lid.The rescue party now follows Simira across the desert. They arrive at a high point above the tent covered encampment below. Simira grimaces and clutches the charm on her necklace. She announces ""We are too late. Theres no chance to help now. It is too late.""In the tomb Quentin and Brecht remove the lid over Andrew's objection. Inside is the mummified remains of the high priest. Farraday cuts into the wrappings on the head with a scalpel. As he does Numar drops the torch he is holding and clutches the side of his face. He falls to the floor unconscious. Storm walks into the chamber carrying a torch.Storm confronts Quentin in his tent. He informs the leader ""Tomorrow we seal up the tomb and that's final."" He adds that as soon as Sylvia is ready to travel they ride back to Cairo. Farraday stops in to talk to Quentin. He tells Quentin his wife is fine but exhausted. He also reports that Numar is also fine just a little shock. He adds that his sister Simira is with him in his tent. Quentin visits with his wife in her tent. She is reluctant to give her husband the bad news. Quentin tries to convince her to be sick a little longer to delay their departure. She wanted to end their relationship in person. Her husband tries to explain what he did for her then finally concludes Storm may have influenced her. Quentin next visits Beauchamp in the work tent. He is drinking and working on the diary and sketches. Brecht and Andrews are still working on the translation on the stone tablet. Quentin wants to find the king's tomb. Storm goes to Quentin's tent to talk but the expedition leader is not there. He grabs a torch and walks into the tomb complex to find Quentin. There is a minor rock fall but Storm continues his search. He hears someone using a pick on the wall and follows the sound. He finds Quentin and reminds him he ordered everyone out of the tomb. Quentin shows Storm that the mummy is missing and cat prints on the floor lead to a solid wall. Quentin storms off to confront Numar. He threatens the young man but the doctor explains that Numar is now ill very ill. His skin and teeth show rapid aging. Numar has a long scar down his face and his hair has turned gray. Quentin is obsessed with the tomb and shows no regard for Numar or his wife.Gromley shoots at Numar entering the tomb. One of the animals is discovered drained of all its blood. Storm tries to get answers from Simira but only gets the same words of warning unheeded. He confines her to her tent. Storm Quentin Beauchamp Farrady and Gromley enter the tomb carrying torches. They split up to search the tomb passages for Numar. Quentin and Beauchamp find what might be the tomb of the king. Beauchamp sarcastically observes that Quentin needed more time and got it. Gromley enters a chamber and looks around but his torch is extinguished by a gust of wind. A door opens and Numar now very old approaches the Sergeant. Gromley fires several shots from his revolver directly into Numar but it has no effect and he continues to approach. He attacks. Later we learn that Gromley's blood was rapidly and completely drained. The noise draws the others to the chamber where they discover the body.Andrews and Brecht complete the translation on the stone tablet. They relay the contents. It is a letter from Rahateb to his high priest regarding his funeral arrangements. The high priest is to commit suicide and guard the king after the king's death. Andrews notes that when the high priest's mummy was disturbed the trouble started. Storm now decided they must remain to solve the mystery and the death of one of his soldiers. The entire party reenters the tomb to work. Brecht goes off alone to explore the tunnels in the tomb complex. Quentin is working on the wall with a pick. Storm finds an opening above their chamber and explores the room. Brecht explores a chamber room. A door swings open and he crawls under it and into another room. It is well stocked with statues and other treasures. A door opens and an even more decrepit Numar exits approaching Brecht. He attacks Brecht but the man barely alive escapes the room with scratches on his face. Storm enters the hidden room and fires at the retreating Numar. He grabs Numar's arm as the door closes. The arm is torn off in the process.Farraday examines the arm and exclaims ""Unbelievable. His body disintegrating. Turning into dust."" Storm makes an appeal to Simira to help them find her brother but she again repeats her chant of ""Tried to warn tried to help you would not listen."" She is escorted back to her tent. Sylvia appeals to Storm to give up so they can leave. In her tent she sees the shadow of a cat but at the entrance Simira enters. Simira stares at Sylvia who runs from her tent. Simira pulls off her necklace. Sylvia makes her way into the tomb complex. She feels her way around trying to find her colleagues. An arm grabs Sylvia and she screams but it is only Smolet. He heads Sylvia to her husband. They walk into the secret room. She relays her story about Simira to the group. They return outside looking for Simiar. Andrews and Quentin remain behind. Quentin pulls a gun on Andrews and tries to beat the location of the king's chamber out of him. The door flies open and Numar is there looking worse than ever. He turns and walks deeper into the tomb of Rahateb and Quentin follows. Quentin only gets a few feet inside when the ceiling collapses killing and burying him.Outside Storm searches each tent for Simira with no luck. It is then they notice Quentin and Andrews missing. They enter the tomb complex and see the remains of the expedition leader. Beauchamp sees Simira's shadow on the wall and finds her amulet. As the group exits the tomb complex they find the sarcophagus lid back in place. They open it and cut the wrapping on the mummy. There they find Numar as an ancient decayed mummy. Numar is now the high priest destined to guard his king. Simira is the cat goddess. They replace the lid and exit the tomb. They bury their dead and depart on their horses. Beauchamp destroys his notes and sketches because he feels no one would believe his story. He drops the cat amulet and we close with the remaining members of the expedition and rescue party riding off on their horses."

"A man runs frantically down a deserted residential street at night from some unseen threat. A doorway in a walled-in yard opens and a girl wordlessly allows the man to come in. He collapses next a swimming pool exhausted and the girl comes to his side seemingly to help him. Instead she suddenly produces a strait razor and slashes his throat.A vague female figure walks down a long hallway while we hear her voice narrating. She is Arletty (Marianna Hill) confined to a mental institution. She warns of a town called Point Dune where the moon turned blood red and caused some kind of change to come upon the residents. ""They'll take you one by one and no one will hear your scream!"" she says. The movie proceeds in flashback with Arletty narrating occasionally in voice-over.Arletty explains that she was originally travelling to Point Dune to make contact with her father a painter who lived and worked there in a beach house. He had stopped communicating with Arletty after a series of letters that became more and more bizarre as he seemed threatened by some unexplained illness or madness. On her way to Point Dune she stops for gas at an isolated rural service station where she finds the lone attendant (Charles Dierkop) firing a gun into the darkness at some unseen target. He holsters the gun and comes to pump Arletty's gas when a pickup truck driven by an odd looking albino man (Bennie Robinson) also pulls up. While refueling the truck the attendant surreptitiously looks under a tarp in the back and discovers two dead bodies one with the eyes ripped out and the other being the man from the beginning of the film with the slashed throat. He says nothing but tries to get rid of Arletty quickly sending her away without even paying for her gas. Some time after she leaves the attendant is murdered inside the service station when a strange figure (Willard Huyck) suddenly leaps out of the car he's working on.Arletty goes to her father's house and finds it abandoned. The walls are elaborately decorated with eerie murals depicting life-size human figures and Arletty finds a journal her father kept where he discusses a sickness he seems to be enduring that borders on madness. Desperate to make contact with someone who may know his whereabouts she goes into town the next day to an art gallery that used to sell his work only to find that they now claim they never sold his art. The gallery curator refers her to three people who he says were just in the gallery earlier that day also looking for her father and Arletty locates them at a local motel. They are Thom (Michael Greer) Toni (Joy Bang) and Laura (Anitra Ford) and when Arletty enters their room they are interviewing a local vagrant (Elisha Cook Jr.) who relates a story passed on to him by his father about a time when the moon turned blood red and caused the locals to revert to savage acts of violence. Thom presses him to elaborate but he becomes afraid and leaves hurriedly. Thom explains to Arletty that he is a foreign aristocrat a collector of regional legends and a fan of her father's work. He says he stopped by the gallery and they had his work displayed in the window but refused to sell it to him which contradicts the gallery attendant's statement that they never carried her father's work. After Arletty leaves she's stopped by the vagrant who warns her that if she encounters her father she must burn him in order to avoid becoming his victim. The next day Arletty awakens to find Thom and the two women are in her father's house with her. Thom explains that the old man was found dead later that day seemingly eaten by animals and all the local motels suddenly refused to rent them a room so they had nowhere to go. Arletty allows them to stay and Thom seems to take an interest in her which causes Laura to become annoyed. She tells Toni that she's leaving and after setting out on foot a vehicle stops to offer her a ride. It's the same pickup truck driven by the albino with a small group of men sitting in the back who are staring emotionless up at the sky. Laura decides to accept the ride but changes her mind once the albino pulls a mouse out of his pocket and eats it alive. She asks to be let out and she walks the rest of the way to town on foot. She finds the town deserted and she follows a lone figure into a supermarket. Unable to attract the man's attention she follows him through the market until she discovers a group of townsfolk gathered around a meat cooler ravenously devouring the raw meat like animals. They suddenly notice her and chase her until they have her cornered dragging her to the floor and eating her alive. The next day Arletty is summoned by the police to identify her father's body which has been discovered on the beach. Arletty is distraught but behaving strangely. Toni becomes bored and Thom sends her into town with the car so she can go to the movies. Back at the house Arletty discovers that she is bleeding from her ear and she has a strange experience where she burns her hand on the hot stove but doesn't feel any pain. She confides in Thom that the body on the beach was not her father something she knows because she didn't recognize his hands. Thom suddenly becomes concerned about Toni.In town Toni attends a screening of a movie called ""Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye"". She buys a ticket from an attendant who barely acknowledges her and finds the rest of the lobby deserted. The minute she walks in the attendant puts up a ""closed"" sign and the lights on the marquee are turned out. Toni finds the large theater empty except for one or two other patrons. Having a seat in the center near the front she watches the movie while the camera reveals more and more of the ghoulish townsfolk gathering in the seats behind her until the theater is nearly full. Finally two of the ghouls take a seat on either side of Toni and she notices they are bleeding from the eyes. Suddenly she turns around and realizes just how many of the strange people are in there with her and starts to panic rushing for the exits which are now blocked from the other side. Trapped inside with the ghouls the movie ends and the screen goes white and suddenly they rush at her and eat her while she screams.Thom who has arrived in town too late to help Toni sees some of the strange townspeople. Two police officers arrive and order a small crowd of them to disperse after which the crowd advances on them. They start firing into them but the people are unaffected by the bullets. Suddenly one of the officers starts bleeding from the eyes somehow infected by the same thing the townsfolk have. The normal officer fires on him and runs off but the other shoots him in the back. The mob descends on him and they eat his body. Thom runs off and is chased by a few of the mob. One of them attacks him and claws at his neck but he is able to break away. He encounters a normal woman but she transforms as they speak bleeding from her eyes.Meanwhile Arletty discovers that the signs of her infection have worsened. She pokes a pin into her leg and cannot feel it and she vomits a horde of insects and lizards into the sink. Finding someone else in the house with her she realizes it is her father (Royal Dano) who tells her that the townspeople have been infected by a century-old curse brought on by a ""dark stranger"" who rode into town on a horse 100 years ago. A survivor of the Donner party this stranger brought with him a strange curse of cannibalism after which he walked into the sea promising to return in 100 years when the moon turned blood red. He warns Arletty to leave but she refuses to go without him at which point he becomes violent and tries to attack her. Remembering the words of the vagrant Arletty sets him on fire and frees him from the undead curse. Thom returns to the house and discovers the charred body at which point a terrified Arletty attacks him and stabs his arm with scissors. Thom manages to calm her and they bandage his wound but ghouls start breaking into the house and trying to surround them. They escape to the beach where they find others waiting for the arrival of the ""dark stranger"". Trapped by the mass of ghouls they swim out into the water where Thom drowns due to his wounded arm.The film ends with Arletty back in the institution where her voice-over narration informs us the ghouls pulled her from the water and dressed her in a gown as an offering to the dark stranger who returned as predicted. She says he let her go in order to carry his story to others which is why she was institutionalized. Unable to convince anyone that she's sane Arletty is forced to wait in the asylum until the undead infection that began in Point Dune reaches the rest of the world plunging it into chaos and bloodshed."

"The small beach community of Potters Bluff advertises ""A New Way of Life.""George Le Moyne (Christopher Allport) a vacationing photographer snaps photographs on the beach when an attractive young woman (Lisa Blount) approaches. She asks him who he is and what he is doing. When she asks him his name he refuses to answer.

The girl takes his camera away and others in the crowd take pictures as George is beaten tied up to a post and set on fire.Later that evening Sheriff Dan Gillis (James Farentino) examines the site of a car accident with George's burned body inside. William G. Dobbs (Jack Albertson) an elderly coroner-mortician arrives from his funeral home with his hearse radio blaring jazz music but as Dobbs examines the burned body George screams and is rushed to the hospital.The next morning Sheriff Gillis stops at the diner where fisherman Phil (Barry Corbin) and a few other locals ask about the unknown victim. As Dan informs them that the man is in the hospital he is served coffee by Midge the waitress (Linda Turley) one of the towns persons who set George on fire.That night an intoxicated fisherman (Ed Bakey) on the docks is murdered by another mob of townspeople who once again record the event with their cameras.The next day when Sheriff Dan Gillis asks hotel proprietor Ben (Macon McCalman) if any guests have disappeared the lawman is shown George's room.

That night before Janet leaves for a PTA meeting she hands her husband a roll of 16mm film that her students shot for a class project and asks him to drop it off to be developed.Meanwhile a family of three stops at the diner to ask for directions and Midge refers them to ""Freddie"" a gas station attendant who resembles burn victim George LeMoyne but in perfect condition. As the family drives through the fog an unidentified creature runs in front of their car and they crash. They go for help at a nearby house which is seemingly deserted until the family is surrounded by townspeople. The couple and their young son escape but as they drive away a woman in the back seat attacks the boy. The couple grabs their child ripping the woman's hair and revealing stitches on her scalp. She is thrown from the car as it speeds off.Meanwhile driving the deserted streets Sheriff Dan Gillis is startled as the family's car races past. He follows but hits a pedestrian. Dan gets out to investigate and finds the man's severed arm on the front grille of his car. The injured man sits up hits Dan grabs the arm and runs away. Dan follows the man but quickly looses him.

The hotel proprietor Ben tells Dan that he saw George LeMoyne as ""Freddie"" at the gas station and wants Janet to verify the man is actually George.In her classroom Janet lectures on voodoo explaining that the ""walking dead"" closely imitate the living but are completely at the will of their master who maintains control by hiding the person's heart. One of her students is Jamie the same boy who tried to escape with his parents the previous night. Dan arrives at the school and questions his wife why Principal Haskell was unaware of the photographic equipment purchase but Janet claims it was a surprise gift for Haskell from the PTA. When they reach the gas station Janet does not recognize ""Freddie.""Across town a female hitchhiker (Lisa Marie) accepts a ride into Potters Bluff but the driver is the recently murdered fisherman. The mob of townspeople attack pull out the hitchhiker from the truck and her skull is crushed by the townspeople. At the funeral home Dobbs restores the hitchhiker's beauty with sculpting makeup and a new eyeball. After Dobbs leaves the room a shadowy figure appears touches the corpse and she sits up.Elsewhere the doctor informs Dan that the flesh from the car's grille has been dead for at least three months. Later as the doctor studies the flesh under a microscope townsfolk (whom include Ernie Harry the fisherman Midge the waitress Nurse Lisa and the female hitchhiker) murder him by shoving tubes of acid in his nose.The next morning Dobbs arrives at the sheriff's office and is frantic claiming that the hitchhiker's body is missing from his funeral home but he does not want to tell anyone because it will ruin his reputation. Dan is further confused to what is going on when Dobbs claims that Janet visited him several times assuming the undertaker knew about voodoo.A short time later Dan learns that the St. Louis police have identified George LeMoyne and want the body. At the cemetery Dan gets tired of waiting for Dobbs and asks the gravedigger Sam (Michael Pataki) to dig up George's grave. As Sam digs Sheriff Gillis searches the funeral home but does not find Dobbs who is resting in one of the corpse drawers. At the grave site Dan and Sam open the casket to discover only a severed heart inside.At the police station Dan orders the receptionist and secretary Betty (Estelle Omans) to contact the state police in Rhode Island for any criminal or arrest record and background information on Dobbs. While Dan goes outside to wait the doctor (now a reanimated being) approaches Dan where he asks the doctor if there is any way possible to raise and control the recently dead. But the doctor dismisses Dan's theory. The sheriff returns to the station where he and Betty read a message on the station's telex that arrives which reads that Dobbs was formerly ""Doctor Dobbs"" the chief pathologist for over 30 years in Providence Rhode Island until he was dismissed from his job on October 10 1969 when he was discovered performing unauthorized autopsies of dead bodies in the city morgue. Dobbs escaped prosecution by a grand jury hearing but on November 30 he had his doctor's credentials removed from the RI medical society and he left Rhode Island shortly thereafter and settled in Potters Bluff Maine the following year in the spring of 1970. Dan then wonders what has Dobbs been doing most of this time in town for the past 10 years.Dan picks up the developed reel of film from Ernie (who is hiding his decomposing right hand being a reanimated cadaver). Dan goes home and watches the film alone (Note: the movie camera that one of the towns person used to film the murders is in Gillis coat closet). In the film Dan watches an unknown man enter a house and then sees footage of a woman having sex with a man in the house's bedroom before she stabs him to death while the townspeople enter the scene. The woman in the film is Dan's wife Janet. Dobbs is also in the film and watching the events unfold.Dan races to the funeral home where Dobbs screens films of all the murders. Dobbs admits that Janet was his first reanimated cadaver that he brought back to life when he first arrived in Potters Bluff 10 years ago and greatest creation but will not reveal his secret method to reanimating the dead despite Dan's threats to shoot him. When Janet arrives acting as if nothing is amiss Dobbs insists the dead only have the memories he gives them. Part of Janet's skin comes off in Dan's hand and he shoots her. She continues to talk until she realizes that she is so damaged she can't possibly be alive. Janet states aloud as if she just realized ""I'm dead Dan"". Dan shoots Dobbs and follows Janet to the graveyard where she climbs into George's open grave. She begs Dan to bury her and insists she loves him as he gently drops dirt on her using his bare hands.Meanwhile back at the funeral home the fatally wounded Dobbs revives plays some jazz swing music on his turnstile record player and after making his face up shoves two embalming tubes in his own stomach before falling dead.Outside at the cemetery the townsfolk zombies in various stages of disrepair surround Dan and offer their condolences to Janet being ""dead and buried"". It is here that Dan is shocked to realize EVERYONE is involved including the doctor Betty Midge Ernie Phil Harry George and Nurse Lisa (all of whom are strangely not attacking him). Dan flees from the cemetery and returns to the morgue where Dobbs seemingly alive awaits. Dobbs tells Dan that ""there is one more thing"" he needs to know. Dobbs turns the sheriff's attention to one of the screens playing the murders where Dan sees that he himself is Janet's murdered lover. In the final shot Sheriff Dan Gillis comes to realize that he is also one of the living dead this whole time... when he finds his hands that he used to bury Janet cracked and decomposing. Dobbs offers Dan to fix his damaged hands for him. On this creepy and eerie note 'Dead and Buried' comes to a close with a freeze frame and fade out."

Nothing appears out of the ordinary with the exception of her father falling and slightly injuring himself. She discusses the island and the siren with the doctor again but returns home. She decides to find out more information on the internet. She reads about the Roanoke colony and the Mary Celeste. At the same time the doctor begins to do some research on what Yuki has told her and we see Hideo is being told a story by the woman in red again. The story appears to be about victims of a terrible disease were once isolated on Yamajima. The story goes that the flesh of a mermaid could bring ever-lasting life a cure to the disease. They reportedly captured a mermaid and ate it. But before the mermaid died it let out a terrible scream and cursed the island. Yuki sees old video footage from 1976 that was filmed by the rescue party who found the one survivor. After seeing this the website shows a picture of the woman in red.Yuki rushes out to find Hideo and finds him sitting with the woman in red. Yuki tells Hideo to come to her and he does just as the siren begins to wail again. She takes Hideo to an old house where a man is living and who had also previously warned Yuki of the siren. While there Shibito begin attacking and attack the man tries to fight them off but is killed. This gives time for Yuki and Hideo to head back to their house. There Yuki declares that she and Hideo will leave the island in the morning. While looking for things to take with them Yuki finds a hidden room in their house. In the hidden room there are pictures of people from 1976. Including a picture of the doctor who looks exactly the same as he did in 1976. Just as she discovers this the siren begins wailing again and the power in the house goes out. Thats when Yuki sees that her father is now a Shibito. He tries to kill them but Yuki and Hideo are able to escape. Outside they try to find help but discover that every person on the island is now a shibito.While trying to escape Hideo points out the metal tower with the siren on it. Yuki and Hideo head that way and begin to climb to the top. On the way up they are being followed by Shibito with many more coming to the metal tower. Yuki finally makes it to the top and begins to destroy the siren. After doing so Yuki realizes she can still hear the siren. By then the doctor has climbed to the top of the tower yelling to Yuki that there is no siren. Its all in her mind. And that Hideo died a long time ago. We then flash back to several scenes in the movie seeing Yuki going through the same motions as before but Hideo is not there explaining why people were looking at her oddly. We then flash back to a scene of her father and Yuki in an ambulance with paramedics trying to revive Hideo but to no avail. Realizing that there is nothing left for her Yuki lets herself fall off the metal tower.We then see she survived the fall with the doctor and her father talking about Yuki and her recovery. While watching over her the doctor notices Yuki still has the half of the torn diary in her pocket. He takes it from her and puts it together with the other half of the diary he had from the files of the massacre in 1976. Reading it he sees that the person who wrote it states that when the siren sounded the fourth time he must kill them all. We then see Yuki awaken to the sound of the siren. She appears behind the doctor with a scalpel and attacks. We then see the woman in red singing about hells gate opening as the movie ends with the sky turning black and the sea turning red.

"The film begins with a written disclaimer:""During the film you are about to see you will be subject to subliminal messages and mild hypnosis.""""This will cause you no physical harm or lasting effect but if for any reason you lose control or feel that your mind is leaving your body -- leave the auditorium immediately.""The disclaimer is accompanied by a narrator who advises viewers to take caution regarding their surroundings once the film has begun and not to engage in conversation with any unknown individuals for the duration of the running time.In the opening scene John (Michael Lerner) is at home with his mother. While he is playing with the pet pigeons in their cages a bird flies out and around the room until he manages to catch it and return it to his mother. John goes to work at an eye clinic where a doctor (Nat Baker) shows John and a group of students (Gustavo Gili Antonio Regueiro and Joaqun Ribas) a collection of eyeballs in jars. John then goes to a patient named Caroline (Isabel Garca Lorca) whom he tries to help put contact lenses in her eyes. John leaves after Caroline makes a comment about his eyes and a nurse (Patrice Manget) tells her that John is sensitive to such comments because John is a diabetic and he is slowly losing his vision. Caroline continues her complaints and from home John's mother (Zelda Rubinstein) seems to listen to the conversation through a shell. ""You'll be sorry!"" John's mother says.Later John is at home eating dinner and his mother plays a spiral on the turntable takes off John's thick-lenses glasses and relaxes him through hypnosis. ""Now you are with Mommy as one."" John visits Caroline at her house telling her that he has the correct prescription for her eyes. John lets himself into the house to ask Caroline to let him try out her new contact lenses. After fitting them in Caroline seems content so John apologizes about that morning and he suddenly pulls out a scalpel and slashes Caroline's throat. When Caroline's boyfriend (Jos Mara Chucarro) walks into the room and sees Caroline's dead body John throws the scalpel at him and then stabs him in the stomach. At home John's mother gets a phone call from the hospital. She says that John is not coming back (a conversation that John ""hears"" through his merging of minds with his mother. John's mother thinks that the entire hospital is against John and she tells him via telepathy to cut out all people's eyes.)As John is cutting out the dead Caroline and her boyfriend's eyes the image slowly pulls back to reveal that this whole thing is a movie being shown to a small audience in a small movie theatre. The slasher film is called The Mommy and it is having a matinee showing in this theater somewhere in Los Angeles. Among the audience are two teenage girls named Patty (Talia Paul) and Linda (Clara Pastor). Patty is disgusted and frightened by the film and of John's character. The unfeeling Linda munching on popcorn tells Patty that it is only a movie.In the film John is called home by his mother and she confronts him to kill all of the people in the city saying ""all of the eyes of the city will be ours"".Patty begins to complain about her eyes becoming irritated from her own contact lenses and she sees a weird looking man (ngel Jov) sitting across the aisle from her also rubbing his eyes.In the film Mother begins an eerie trance for John involving spirals and many people in the theater audience seem dazed by the movie. Patty tells Linda that she feels dizzy and her breathing gets heavier until finally the on-screen trance is over and John stands up to leave and tells his mother ""they are going to be very sorry Mother."" John goes out and goes to a movie theatre that is playing The Lost World (1925) sits behind a man stabs him with a screwdriver and cut out his eyes with a scalpel. Patty finally leaves Linda to watch the film alone.Mother tells John to go for more people in the theater. John sits behind a couple as the woman (Diane Pinkley) goes for more popcorn and he kills the unaccompanied husband (Benito Porcino).In a women's room stall Patty sees a pair of shoes outside the door and when they are gone she runs back into the theater and tells her that the weird looking man was in the bathroom. Linda points him out still sitting in his chair. But Patty is convinced that a man was in the bathroom and she persuades Linda to go check. Linda who wants more popcorn anyway finally agrees to check it out and tells Patty to stay to tell her what happened.In the film the woman returns to her seat and offers popcorn to her dead husband (which John accepts). John then puts a cloth around her face.Patty continues staring at the weird looking man who looks at his wristwatch as if timing the movements in the movie. Patty becomes more uneasy when he stands up and leaves the theater.In the movie Mother tells John to come home but John refuses saying that he can do all this alone. He goes to a restroom and begins to count his eyeballs.In the theater lobby the girl at the concession stand (Josephine Borchaca) and the woman at the ticket booth (Antonella Murga) are shot and killed by the weird looking man who has a silenced .38 caliber semi-automatic pistol. Linda comes out of the ladies room to see the killer dragging the bodies away. A terrified Linda takes cover in the men's room and hides in a stall while the killer enters to hide the two bodies in a stall right next to hers.In the movie a woman confronts John for being in the ladies room and he chokes her to death and in the struggle loses his glasses when they fall off and break on the floor. Mother continues to plead with John to come back home but John refuses. The ticket lady enters the bathroom and screams when she sees John hanging over the stall and is swiped with the blade. John goes to the lobby for some popcorn and then attacks the concession girl as well.In the real world the killer reloads his gun and he seems to be mimicking John's actions on the screen. A man sitting behind a very anxious Patty asks her if she is okay and she tells him that her friend has been gone for a long time. The man asks Patty what her friend's name is and says that he will go to find her. The man enters the now deserted theater lobby and enters the men's room where he is shot through the neck by the killer. In parallel to both movies the killer and John both secure the theater doors as the killer in the real world says ""Don't worry Mother. I won't leave"" and as John in the movie does so he is caught by the projectionist who has entered the lobby for his break. John chases him and tries to kill him but is unsuccessful. The projectionist is soon seen calling the police. In the real world a terror-stricken Linda slips out of the men's room and manages to get outside. Linda stops a passing salesman in the street and tells him that there is a murderer in the theater. The man walks with Linda to the theater where he goes inside sees the secured doors and blood on the floor. The man runs back out and the two of them run down the street to call the police.Back in the theater the woman who was with the helpful man tells Patty that she will be right back for her husband has not returned. The woman is grabbed by the killer when she walks past a curtain and he shoots her as well. The killer then grabs Patty and holds her hostage while she is still in her seat further mimicking John's onscreen dialogue.In the movie a woman in the audience finds the results of John's killings and panic ensues. John stabs a man who tries to get out the secured fire escape door and also failed to reason with John. He quickly grabs the man's teenage daughter hostage and stands in front of the theater screen which continues to screen The Lost World. John screams out for his mother to come get him and Mommy leaves her house and takes a taxi to the theater. She tells the driver to call the police to save the people John has in the theater.At the same time the killer then yells at the on-screen John when a man in the audience stands to confront him and is shot dead. Panic breaks out as the killer begins shooting at other people and he drags Patty to the front of the screen. Outside in both movies the police arrive and surround both theaters. In the old movie the police break into the theater and Mommy enters with them and tries to reason with John still holding the teen girl hostage in front of the theater screen.In the real world SWAT teams enter the theater through the roof and cut the movie's sound and tell the killer to let Patty go. The killer refuses saying that he has to wait until his mother comes to get him. He shoots at the screen at John and thus drops Patty to the floor. The police sharpshooters then open fire killing the man. When Patty looks at the screen to see Mommy hypnotizing John out of his trance a policeman opens fire and accidentally hits Mommy instead and John cradles her. Suddenly John looks right at Patty and address her directly saying ""I want your eyes too!"" He throws the scalpel out of the screen and hits Patty right in her left eye. The police break into the theater and all of the terrified patrons flee. They find Patty on the ground screaming hysterically (but with no scalpel in her eye). They get her outside where she is reunited with Linda and they take her to a hospital for evaluation. In the old movie John is taken into police custody and will presumably be placed in a mental hospital. The last shot of the old movie shows the chief of police looking upon Mommy's corpse.At the hospital in the real world Linda and Patty's parents are with her relieved that Patty is fine and just a little emotionally shaken from her horrific experience. When Patty's parents leave Linda stays a while longer. A little later Linda tells Patty that she will return tomorrow. In a nearby elevator Linda is suddenly grabbed by an unseen orderly and a scalpel is aimed at her throat. The orderly walks into Patty's room with a tray and she sits up in her bed and tries to scream. The orderly is John.... and he wants her eyes! John tells Patty as he begins to examine her eyes ""like the doctor said it's all in your imagination. I really don't exist."" Patty finally manages to scream.During the closing credits it's revealed that Patty's story was also a movie within a movie. The theatre audience watching this movie leaves the theatre and the last patron (Jaume Figueras) leaves for the left."

"Title and credits run over a section of granite headstone. We pull back to reveal a cemetery and are shown text ""Science has learned that man possesses powers which go beyond the boundaries of the natural. This is the story of one confronted by such strange forces within himself."" Robert Kraft (Richard Boone) and the caretaker Andy McKee (Theodore Bikel) walk to the Immortal Hills Cemetary office building. Bob Kraft has taken over the chairmanship of the cemetery and is briefed on the routine by Andy. Bob notices a map on the wall of the cemetery. Andy explains that a black pin on a plot indicates someone buried and a white pin indicates a sold plot not yet occupied. Bob asks Andy ""McKee you've been on the job now forty years right?"" Andy replies ""Aye"" in his Scottish accent. Bob informs him he is to be retired and assures him he will draw the same monthly paycheck. Bob asks Andy for a replacement recommendation. Andy walks over to the desk and pulls a gun. He tells Bob it is available in case of emergencies. A young couple drive up to the office. It is Stuart Drexel (and uncredited Glen Vernon) and his new bride Elizabeth (an uncredited Lynette Bernay). A provision in Stu's inheritance is that he buy a plot for him and his wife before he can draw part of his trust from the bank. Beth is not amused by the entire situation and lets her new husband know. They drive off and Bob goes back to the office. Upon his return Andy greets him with a shot of liquor. He explains that the previous chairman left it to sooth customers needing fortification to get through the burial process of a loved one. Bob places two pins on plots in the Drexel area of the cemetery.In his Department Store office Bob his Uncle George Kraft (Howard Smith) and the outgoing chairman Henry Trowbridge (an uncredited Russ Bender) go through the formal process of swearing in Bob Kraft as the new chairman. Bob is not happy with the ""honor"" claiming he is far too busy to take on the role. But Uncle George insists explaining that it is a family and company tradition and that it is his turn. While it is done pro bono it is expected because three previous generations of Krafts did. It only entails a few hours a month of work. The caretaker takes care of day to day operations. As soon as he is sworn in he gets a telephone call from the local undertaker. He is told that Stu Drexel and his new bride Beth are dead.At the cemetery office Bob and Andy are going over some paper work when the local newspaper reporter Jess Jessup (Herbert Anderson) walks in. He tells Bob and Andy he is on the obituary detail and complains the office is cold. When Bob tells Andy to change the Drexel pins from white to black Andy informs Bob that they are already black. Bob dismisses it saying ""I must have picked up the wrong color"" when he marked the plots. Bob mentions the mistake made him feel eerie. Andy adds ""I think he means he marked the young couple for death sir."" Jess jokes that if any more pins are used to stay away from his area of the cemetery. As Jeff leaves Bob's fiance Ann Craig (Peggy Maurer) arrives. She lightly complains that she was stood up for their lunch date. Bob and Ann quickly make up. Bob goes back to the map and randomly places a black pin on a plot. He looks to see his choice. A black and white pin sits on the ""W. Isham"" plot. He pulls the white pin out. The phone rings and he informs the caller that the funeral is for immediate family only. Ann returns to the office and they embrace and kiss. They leave the cemetery office.William Isham (an uncredited Cyril Delevanti) is repairing a teddy bear in his shop. He finishes stitching a section. As he is installing the eyes he collapses and dies. At the cemetery Andy is finishing the Drexel marble headstone. Bob asks Andy if he has found his replacement. No is the reply but Andy does show some progress in another area. He has fixed the space heater. Bob reviews the paperwork and notices an invoice for the funeral of William Isham. The pair walk over to the map and Andy tells Bob that he was going to change the white pin to black but noticed it was already black. Bob tells Andy he changed the pin. Bob calls Jessup at the newspaper office. He informs Andy he change the pin color before the man died. Jessup reassures Bob that there is nothing supernatural. It was just a coincidence.Uncle George and Bob are going over store figures when Bob blurts out that he is quitting the chairmanship. ""I'm going to call Bates Honegger and Trowbridge right now and tell them I'm quitting."" He reminds his uncle that three incorrectly placed pins accounted for three deaths. Uncle George laughs out loud. He tells Bob he is going out to the cemetery to put some black pins on the map to wipe out the competition. The two drive out together. At the cemetery George pulls out Henry Trowbridge's pin. Bob insists he actually make the exchange then places a black pin on the map. Bob has a shot of booze and the two depart.Later that evening Bob calls Henry Trowbridge at home. His wife answers the phone. It is 11:40 p.m. and Henry's wife informs Bob that her husband is not breathing. The body count is now four. The police drive up to the cemetery office. Lt. Clayborne (Robert Osterich) talks to Bob. Incredulous Clayborne summarizes the situation ""Let me get this straight Mr. Kraft. You say that every time you stick a black pin in the map people turn up dead?"" Clayborne reminds Bob that the Drexel couple were killed in a traffic collision. Isham died of a cerebral hemorrhage and Henry Trowbridge had a coronary thrombosis. He investigated and found nothing to suggest foul play. Bob starts to think it isn't the map but he may be responsible.At his store office Bob is informed by his Uncle George that he needs a vacation and George arranges one. Bob asks the committee be assembled that night at 7:00 p.m. Ann tries to reassure Bob it is a coincidence and suggests the vacation be turned into a honeymoon. That evening the committee members meet in Bob's office. Bill Honegger (an uncredited Ken Drake) and Charlie Bates (an uncredited Matt Moore) join Uncle George and Bob Kraft. Bill has a proposal to keep Bob as chairman. The committee demands Bob go out to the cemetery that evening and change Bill Charlie and Uncle George's white pins to black then go home to bed. The motion is passed and Bob makes the changes as ordered. Andy McKee stops by the cemetery office and tells Bob to lock the office and never come back. The phone rings. It is Jess and Bob informs him of the three exchanged pins. He tells Jess if anything happens to any of them it is his fault. His attempt to light the portable furnace is unsuccessful. He calls the police and asks for Lt. Clayborne. The Desk Sergeant gives him the number where he can reach him but the number is always busy. He finally realizes the phone number he has been dialing is Bill Honegger's. Jess calls Bob and informs him that Clayborne is with him and that Honegger is dead. He adds that Charlie Bates was found in his apartment dead. Bob is worried about his Uncle George and is surprised when George walks into the cemetery office. George tells Bob that he has proved his point. George pulls his black pin out of the map then leaves the office. Bob calls the police and asks that a policeman be assigned to watch his uncle.Clayborne calls Bob to inform him that George can't be found. Bob exits the office and finds his uncle in his car still on the cemetery grounds. He is dead. He drives back to the office. He informs Lt. Clayborne he found his uncle. He puts the black pin back on the map on his Uncle's plot.The next day Lt. Clayborne returns to the cemetery with Jess and Ann in tow. Clayborne asks about one Jacob Mittel. Bob tells the policeman that he is a buyer for the store and he is currently out of the country on business. At the insistence of Clayborne Bob puts a black pin on his plot. He is informed that Mittel is not dead. He is in Paris. This is a test. The police are setting up a trap. Bob voices his objections. Clayborne suggests Bob may have some unknown power like voodoo in the West Indies.Overworked and overtired Bob begins to hallucinate. He blames himself for the deaths. He concludes that if he changes the black pins back to white he can return the dead to life. With the floor heater broken by his own hand he gathers paper and kindling to light a fire on the floor to keep warm. Out in the cemetery the graves of the recently departed are starting to unearth themselves. Bob discovers this after he awakens in the smoke filled office. He snags his overcoat on one of the headstones. Leaving it behind he runs back to the office. He retrieves the gun from the overturned desk. Before he has a chance to commit suicide the phone rings. It is the voice of Mrs. Mittel. She tells Bob that a cable arrived informing her that her husband died in Paris France. Andy walks in and tells Bob it must be impossible. Andy confesses to Bob that he was responsible for the deaths. Andy was upset at being dismissed after forty years of faithful service. Andy picks up the gun and explains exactly how he killed each one. Andy doesn't believe Jacob Mittel is dead. The police burst into the office after Andy drops dead. Clayborne explains that Jacob Mittel is actually alive. The call and cable were set up by the police with the assistance of Mrs. Mittel. They watched as Andy dug up all seven graves. Bob and Ann leave the cemetery office together. We close with a slow zoom in on the map. It falls off the wall."
