The women are interviewed by Cornelia Jackson, the assistant to magazine publisher John Coudair. When Jackson expresses an interest in Rusty, Maxine sabotages her rival's chances by telling her that Jackson is looking for a model with a brash personality.

After her performance that night, Rusty joins Danny and Genius, another entertainer at the club, at Joe's oyster bar, where they engage in their Friday night ritual of searching for a pearl to bring them luck. When the three return to their apartment house, Rusty finds a telegram from Coudair, inviting her to his office the next day.

Drawn by Rusty's notoriety, crowds begin to flock to Danny's club, and one day, Coudair brings Broadway theater owner Noel Wheaton to meet Rusty and offer her a job. After Rusty rejects his overture, Wheaton tries to woo her with armloads of roses. When Wheaton's strategy fails, Coudair joins forces with him to lure Rusty to Broadway.

The next day, Rusty is late for rehearsal, and Danny gives her song to Maxine to perform. Rusty protests and storms out of the club, bound for Broadway. After making Rusty a star, Wheaton offers to make her his wife, and she agrees to give him an answer the following day. That night Rusty drives to Danny's club and discovers that Danny has closed his establishment and left town with Genius to entertain at army camps. She then goes to Joe's, where Wheaton and Coudair later find her, drunk. Although she accepts Wheaton's proposal, Coudair realizes that she is desperately unhappy.

"Featured in Smart Housekeeping magazine, domestic goddess Elizabeth Lane's column, which focuses primarily on food and which is the most popular column of its kind in the country, is an account of her perfect domestic life as wife and new mother living on a rural Connecticut property. However, it is all a sham as Liz is single, lives in a small New York City apartment, and doesn't know how to cook, she using her Uncle Fritz Bassenak, a chef and restaurateur, as her source for the food items, and her long time suitor, architect John Sloan, who owns a Connecticut farm, as the source of the stories of rural Connecticut life. A problem arises for Liz and by association her editor, Dudley Beecham, who knows the truth about Liz, when their publisher, Alexander Yardley, who values truth above all else, asks Liz to host a Connecticut Christmas dinner for himself and war hero Jefferson Jones. Jeff is one of the few survivors of a bombed destroyer. Spending eighteen days on a life raft, he dreamed more about good food than anything during those eighteen days. His naval hospital nurse, Mary Lee, who he feigned to love just to get that food against doctor's orders, believes that Jeff, who has never had a supportive home life, has to experience such to get him to marry her, which resulted in the request to Liz via Yardley. It isn't until after Liz agrees to marry John, who she does not love but can no longer use the excuse of her flourishing writing career not to marry as she is sure Yardley will fire her once he knows the truth, that Dudley comes up with the idea to use John's Connecticut house and Felix's behind the scenes cooking prowess to host that Christmas dinner in Connecticut, complete with a borrowed baby. All the parties in the know agree. Complications ensue when Liz, John and Felix try to keep the truth from Jeff and Yardley, that truth which includes Judge Crowthers, who is to officiate Liz and John's wedding and who they have to hide physically whenever he is at the farm in order to marry them. But the biggest complication is that Liz and Jeff fall in love at first sight, Jeff whose love may wane if he learns that Liz is not all she appears on the surface.::Huggo"

On his arrival he observes a group of hippies lead by George Berger (Treat Williams) begging for change from a trio of horseback riders. Later, Claude catches the runaway horse the hippies have rented and uses it to show off his riding skills to one of the trio of strangers--an upper class débutante. While returning the horse to the hippies, Claude accepts their invitation to be shown around the city.In the course of a single evening, Claude gets stoned smoking marijuana and then is introduced to the race and class issues of the 1960's. The morning after, George finds a scrap of newspaper identifying the mysterious girl. The hippy group, including Hud (Dorsey Wright), Jeannie (Annie Golden) and Woof (Don Dacus), crash a private party where the girl, Sheila Franklin (Beverly D'Angelo), secretly enjoys the disruption of her rigid environment. After the group is arrested, Claude uses the only money he has to pay George's fine so that George can find the funds to get the rest of them released. Meanwhile, at the prison, Woof's refusal to have his hair cut leads into the title song.Unsuccessful at convincing Sheila to get the funds from her father, George returns to his parents' home and is able to convince his mother to give him enough money to have the others released from jail.For their next adventure, the group attends a peace rally in Central Park where Claude drops acid. When Jeannie proposes they get married to keep Claude out of the Army and Sheila shows up to apologize, Claude's ""trip"" reflects his internal conflict over which world he belongs in--his own native Oklahoman farm culture, the upper class society of Sheila or the free-wheeling world of the hippies.When his trip is over, Claude and the hippies have a falling out over both a mean trick they pull on Sheila (taking her clothes while she's skinny-dipping, which then leads to Sheila being completely humiliated when she has no choice but to hail a taxi completely naked) and their philosophical differences over the war in Vietnam and personal versus community responsibility.

He requires the same kind of commitment from his staff, expecting them to jump to his every whim even at 3.00 in the morning.
Into his well ordered life comes his former 8 year old self, Rusty. Rusty is still excited about life and considers his older self a loser because he doesn't have a chick, isn't a pilot and doesn't have a dog named Chester, things that he always said he would have when he grew up.Rusty is chubby and gets picked on at school back in 1960. Trying to make sense of the situation Russ thinks it must be his job to help the younger Russ so encourages him to stop eating rubbish and takes him to a boxer to help him learn to fight his bullies. Russ' co worker Amy takes a great liking to Rusty, seeing in him qualities that are completely missing from his older self. Rusty picks up on the fact that Russ and Amy may have a future and in an effort not to lose out on such a lovely young woman he proposes to her himself. Unfortunately Russ comes along and events once again show him in an unfavourable light. Amy apologises to young Rusty and leaves. Eventually it dawns on Russ that maybe Rusty has been sent here to help Russ. Russ has blocked out his childhood memories so remembers little of his past life. His relationship with his father is not a good one. By spending more quality time with Rusty and encouraging the boy to tell him about his life back home Russ slowly begins to recover his memories. They aren't good. Russ takes the day off work so the two of them can enjoy their birthday together. They go for a drive and whilst listening to Rusty telling him about being bullied by bigger boys and worse about how these boys torment a poor three legged dog Russ remembers everything. They drive through a tunnel and emerge in 1960 complete with vintage car and clothes! Russ warns Rusty that this is not a good day. As a boy he tried to stop the bullies from setting off fire crackers around the dog's neck and got beaten up for his pains. What was worse he didn't even manage to save the dog. It is recess when they arrive at the school and the bullies see Rusty and call for him to join him. Even though he knows what is in store for him he decides to face them. At least Russ will be there this time. After a rough start he gets the better of the main bully and saves the dog. However he is hauled in front of the Principle and his mother is sent for. Russ warns Rusty that it is not over yet. The day is about to get a lot worse. Rusty's mom takes him home and arrives at the same time as his dad. His father is furious to find that his wife who is seriously ill has been to school takes his worry out on little Rusty. He screams and shouts at him and tells him that his mother is going to die and that it's Rusty's fault.
Russ goes to him as soon as their dad has gone back in the house and explains that dad was just worried and so said things he shouldn't. Rusty wants to know if it is his fault that his mom is dying. Russ reassures him. He hugs the kid and they weep together. It is the first time that Russ has cried since he was 8.
Russ takes Rusty for a ride in their car and they find an old diner which keeps appearing and disappearing throughout the film. Whilst they are eating a dog comes running up to Rusty. His owner shouts for him to come back. He calls him Chester! The two of them race from the diner and onto a private air strip where the dog's owner an old man in a red baseball cap comes to greet them. He is an older version of them, aged about 70. He admits that he has been behind everything. They say goodbye as he walks towards his own plane. There waiting is an old lady who looks as if she might once have been the younger Amy. They are thrilled to see her there and equally thrilled to see Russ Snr fly the plane himself. They both jump for joy on the tarmac, excited to realise that one day they will fulfill their childhood dream of becomming a pilot! Russ looks at the sky again and when he turns back Rusty is gone and he is back in the present. The following day he turns up at Amy's house with a little puppy and she invites him in."

"Dr. Lucio Fulci (more or less playing himself) is a former medical doctor-turned director of gory horror films. He wraps up shooting for the day on his latest film 'Touch of Death' with Brett Halsey playing the human monster/cannibal of women. Fulci leaves the Cincettia Studios for a local restaurant down the street. The young friendly waiter recognizes him and suggests his typical meal: a fillet of steak, or steak tarter. Fulci cannot look at the sample plates of meat without having flashbacks to the cannibalistic scene hed been filming earlier. Shaken, he leaves the restaurant without ordering a meal. The following day, while checking an effects shot from another movie, Fulci irritably snaps at a technician to get a plate of animal eyeballs out of his sight.Returning home to his fancy row house in an old suburb of Rome, the troubled director tries to sleep, but the noise of a handyman's chainsaw outside keeps him awake with recollections of his own recently shot chainsaw mayhem. In a rage, Fulci storms outside and smashes a hachet into cans of paint belonging to the handyman. The spilled red paint reminds Fulci of the acid/blood scene in 'The Beyond'. Fulci walks a few yards from his home and discovers that one of his neighbors in a psychiatricst. Meanwhile, Professor Egon Swharz (David L. Thompson) is arguing with his wife Katya (Melissa Lang). Their bitter routine row is interrupted by the intercom buzzing where his secretary Nurse Lilly (Judy Morrow) informing him of this latest walk-in. Professor Swharz walks in and accepts Fulci into his books for a session. After walking out of the reception area, Nurse Lilly immediately phones a friend saying ""guess who just walked in as a patient!"" Swhartz discusses Fulcis recent problems and suggests that he's ""breaking down the barrier, the boundary between what you film and whats real.""The next day at Cinecitta, Fulci's producer Filippo (Shilett Angel) tells him that the pace has to be stepped up on filming. Fulci is revealed to making two films at the same time: 'The Touch of Death', and 'Ghosts of Sodom'. Robert Egon, the young actor playing the Nazi seducer in the later film, approaches Fulci in a corridor to discuss his role. ""Your presence should make a deadly impression"", says Fulci. ""You are after all a symbol of death. And you've also the whole horror of the Nazis. Get me?"" Fulci talks the actors through the seduction scene in 'Ghost of Sodom'. When the filming is done, Fulci staggers out into a corridor muttering, ""Sadism, Nazism; is there any point any more?""No sooner has Fulci left the set when his producer steers him into a studio suite for an interview with a Munich news crew. The sight of the tall, blond, German lady reporter's long legs triggers a vision of sexual abandon in Nazi Germany (from the film 'Ghosts of Sodom') When Fulci recovers from his vision, he finds himself outside again with his producer saying, ""Lucio, you must stop! Stop, in the name of God!"" Filippo informs the confused director that he has just run amuck, smashed the TV crews camera and tried to rip the interviewer's clothes off.Professor Swharz calls Fulci for another consultation after he had watched all of his films. He suggests using hypnosis. Once Fulci is under, the Professor's true colors are revealed to us. He switches on a buzzer device and describes a mad scheme: ""You'll do everything I tell you when you hear this sound. Your mind will make you live scenes you think are real. You will slowly be possessed by madness. You'll think youve committed terrible crimes."" Swharz also intends to transmit his thoughts to Fulci, although how is never quite explained. After the session is over, Fulci leaves unable to remember anything. Swharz then embarks on a killing spree, starting with the murder of a local prostitute that evening. Fulci arrives on the scene after the police show up and thinks he committed the murder. Rushing away, his car breaks down en route to a film location shoot. When he arrives at a cemetery where a nighttime Gothic scene is to be filmed, he finds that his assistant director, and Filippo his producer, have started filming without him.Back home the following morning, Fulci tries to relax, but with each simple action, he is plagued by memories and visions of screen violence from his movies. Fleeing his house, he goes for a drive. But Swharz follows him and commits three more murders, first a couple in a remote boathouse, and the groundskeeper who witnesses him. Fulci arrives on the scene forcing Swharz to hide, and again Fulci thinks he committed the murders. Getting back into his car for a drive down a long country road, Fulci hallucinates about running over a tramp (from the movie 'Touch of Death'). After returning home, the exhausted auteur phones the police station to speak to his friend Inspector Gabrielli (Jeoffrey Kennedy) intending to make a ""confession."" But he learns that Gabrielli is on vacation.After another visit to the nasty Professor Swharz is of little help to cure him of his waking nightmares, Fulci decides to drive over to Inspector Gabrielli's house in the hope of speaking to him. Swharz follows him there with the buzzer device. Fulci lets himself into his friend's house, and immediately suffers from visions of Gabrielle's family being stabbed, chainsawed, and decapitated. Fulci staggers outside to be greeted by the returning policeman, who reassures the flaky director that his family are safely on holiday in Sardinia. When Fulci expresses his visions to Gabrielli and that he may have killed some people, the cheerful police detective responds, ""If you're trying to create a sensation like you do in your films, this time you've goofed.""Meanwhile, Professor Swharz can stand no more of his wife's bland contempt for him and his practice. So, the insane psychiatrist strangles her to death by ripping out a wire from his wife's piano and nearly decapitates her with it. Swharz then heads out again to tail Fulci, who under the influence of hynosis again, suffers through one more blast of violent imagery and faints in the middle of a field. He comes round the next morning to discover a cat digging up the loosely buried remains of another Swharz victim. As Fulci scrapes soil from the dead features, Inspector Gabrielli appears behind him. Before Fulci can protest his innocence, Gabrielli informs him that Swharz has been shot dead by his men who were tailing Fulci which he ordered after their conversation the previous day, who caught the mad psychiatrist in the act.Several months later. Fulci and the beautiful Nurse Lilly sail on his sailboat, 'Preversion' (named from his first thriller movie). Fulci looks furtively around and follows the young woman into the cabin-quarters. Suddenly, the sound of a chainsaw revs up, followed by her terrified screams. Fulci emerges from the cabin a minute later with a basket of her body parts and attaches the severed fingers onto fishing hooks which he casually casts into the water. Is Fulci really a mad killer after all? No, of course not. It's the last shot of his newest film, 'Nightmare Concert', captured by a film crew sailing alongside. Bidding goodbye to his colleagues, Fulci happily sails out of the harbor with his very-much alive leading lady."

"Julie Richman (Deborah Foreman) is a typical ""Valley girl"" teenager (living in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles, California) who seems to have it all: good looks, popularity, and a handsome Valley dude boyfriend, named Tommy (Michael Bowen), but she is having second thoughts about her relationship with the arrogant and selfish Tommy. At the end of a shopping trip to the local mall with her friends, Loryn (Elizabeth Daily), Stacey (Heidi Holicker), and Suzi Brent (Michelle Meyrink), Julie runs into Tommy and breaks up with him. Later that day at the beach, Julie trades shy glances with a young man in the distance.That night, at a party at Suzi's house, Julie locks eyes with Randy (Nicholas Cage), a Hollywood punk who has crashed the party with his friend, Fred Bailey (Cameron Dye). They hit it off well, especially after Julie learns that Randy was the young man at the beach earlier. Tommy is jealous, and tries to seduce Loryn into bed. He fails and gets his cronies to eject Randy and Fred from the party. Undaunted, Randy sneaks back into the house, and hides in an upstairs bathroom shower. Randy waits in the shower for Julie to enter the bathroom as various partygoers come and go, talking about and trying to have sex, and doing drugs. When Julie eventually does enter, Randy convinces her to leave the party with him. Julie brings a very reluctant Stacey along for the ride with Randy and Fred. While at Randy's favorite Hollywood nightclub, Julie and Randy rapidly grow closer as Stacey continually rebuffs Fred's advances.Over the next few days Julie's friends, dismayed by her relationship with Randy, pressure her to drop him and get back together with Tommy.

After Randy flits about the Valley for the next few days just so he can get a glimpse at Julie, Fred says that he has a plan that will both reunite Randy with Julie and get revenge against Tommy.A minor subplot involves Suzi and her stepmother, Beth (Lee Purcell), vying for the attention of a boy named Skip (David Ensor). At the party, Suzi tells Beth, who is chaperoning, about Skip, who she likes and hopes will show up. When Skip does arrive, Beth finds herself attracted to him. Beth's boyfriend Lyle (Wayne Crawford) is oblivious to Beth's desire for the teenage guy Skip. However, Skip is also attracted to Beth and goes out of his way to go to see her without Suzi finding out by delivering groceries to the house while Suzi is not home.One day, Skip enters Suzi's house, apparently looking for Beth. He goes upstairs and finds a woman in the shower in Beth's bedroom. Skip and this woman, whose face is not shown, are then shown making love. Another woman arrives home and goes upstairs.

Stacey reveals that Tommy made a reservation at the Valley Sheraton Hotel as an after-prom ""surprise"" for Julie.Tommy and Julie ride to the prom in a rented stretch limousine; Randy and Fred arrive shortly after and sneak backstage. Randy becomes increasingly annoyed with just watching the Valley High kids dance, but Fred assures him that all is going according to plan. Julie and Tommy are escorted backstage, waiting to be introduced as king and queen of the prom. Randy confronts Tommy, and the two begin to brawl. When the prom king and queen are announced, the curtain pulls back to reveal Randy beating up Tommy. Randy knocks Tommy out, then escorts a thrilled Julie from the stage through the crowd. Tommy recovers and storms through the crowd towards Randy and Julie, who start a food fight to slow Tommy down and facilitate their escape from the venue in Tommy's rented limousine.As the happy couple ride into the night towards the Valley Sheraton, Julie removes Tommy's I.D. bracelet, which had been a sign of the relationship between the two during the entire film, and throws it out the window. The scene, which echoes the final scene of the film 'The Graduate', pans to the overview of the Valley, while the limo turns past the Sherman Oaks Galleria glowing in the night. End credits."

In her mind, she assumes the identity of one of the characters in the daytime drama, a nurse.That evening, Sheriff Ballard (Pruit Taylor Vance), Roy Ostery (Crispin Glover) a local reporter, and the police are examining the crime scene while Betty calmly packs a suitcase. She seems oblivious to the murder, even with the investigation going on right in her house. At the police station, a psychiatrist examines her.Betty spends the night at her friend's house in a nearby town, sleeping in a child's bedroom with the innocence of a little girl. In the middle of the night, she suddenly gets in her car and drives off. Betty's next stop is a bar in Arizona where the lady bartender talks about her inspiring vacation in Rome, and Betty tells her that she's engaged to a famous surgeon (describing the lead character from 'A Reason to Love'... not the actor who portrays him, but the character himself).Meanwhile, the two hitmen are trying to find her, as they have finally realized that she must have the car with the drugs. As they search, Charlie (Freeman) begins falling in love with his image of Betty, to the consternation of Wesley (Rock).The next day, Betty arrives in Los Angeles and tries to get a job as a nurse while looking for her long-lost ""ex-fiance"". She is turned down, due to lack of a resume or references, but does manage to get a job in a local pharmacy due to her help in saving the life of the victim of a drive-by shooting.Despite an injunction against ""touching"" the patients, Betty becomes popular with them and their families. She ends up living with Rosa (Tia Texada), a Hispanic legal secretary who has had a series of painful love affairs and offers to help Betty find her surgeon friend. However, Rosa learns that ""David"" is a just soap opera character, and she goes to the pharmacy window to confront her. Betty just thinks her friend is jealous and is impervious to the revelation.Meanwhile, a lawyer has an idea and supplies tickets to a charity function where George (Greg Kinnear), the actor portraying David, will be making an appearance. Betty meets George at the function whom he addresses to his soap opera character of David. George is inclined to dismiss her as an over-imaginative fan, but something about her compels him to walk back and talk to her some more. He begins to think that Betty is a struggling actress determined to get a part in the soap opera, so he decides to play along. After three hours of her ""staying in character,"" he takes her home.George begins falling in love with her and he and his producer decide to bring her onto the show as a new character: Nurse Betty. When Betty arrives on set, she finally falls out of her fantasy world and back into real life as seeing the inner workings of a television show snaps her back into reality. After two failed takes, she realizes that she is on a set and that the all people around her whom she thought were real are just actors portraying characters. George confronts her for being a ""crazy person"" and Betty walks out of the studio.Now recovered, Betty begins to tell Rosa what happened, when the two hitmen, Charlie and Wesley, come into the house to kill them as not to leave any loose ends when they discover the car containing the drugs outside. The killers are in turn interrupted by the reporter Roy Ostery and Sheriff Ballard from Betty's home town who have also tracked her down and a hostage situation develops.When Wesley is distracted by Roy who turns on the TV set to watch the soap opera, Ballard pulls out a gun hidden in an ankle holster and shoots and kills Wesley. At this point, Charlie flees to the bedroom with Betty where he reveals to her that Wesley is his son. Charlie, rather than being arrested, decides not to kill Betty, and commits suicide by attemping to escape and in so doing is apparently gunned down by the police.Betty decides to stay in Los Angeles and try to rebuild her life. She is offered a job on the show by George, and she accepts. She appears in 63 episodes and then takes a vacation in Rome. Betty plans to pursue nursing as a career and decides to try out a relationship with George, while her former roommate, Rosa, begins a relationship with Roy.

"This movie 'Head' is about the nature of free will, conceived and edited in a stream of consciousness style with no plot at all.'Head' begins at the dedication of a bridge. As a local politician struggles with his microphone during the dedication speech, the ""wacky, fun-loving"" Monkees (Micky Dolenz, Davy Jones, Peter Tork, and Michael Nesmith), suddenly interrupt the ceremony by running through the assembled officials, to the sound of various horns and sirens....The rest of the film shows what happened that led up to that.Earlier... the four have just all kissed the same groupie, who tells them that they were indistinguishable. Throughout the film, they make their way both together and seperately through a series of unrelated vignettes, each being a different type of movie (a mystery, a war movie, a western, a desert adventure, etc...).One memorable segment shows Micky trecking alone through a vast desert until he finds a soft drink vending machine standing on top of a sand dune. He is overjoyed to find that it is not a mirage, and happy that he has spare change, but infurated when the machine takes his money and gives him nothing back, for the machine is out of order. Then a small group of heavily armed soldiers, complete with a tank and all, arrive to fight Micky for control of the vending machine until Micky subdues the commanding officer, the entire unit surrenders to the lone Micky, who then takes advantage of this to commandeer the tank and blows up the broken down vending machine.In each one segment, the Monkees try to deal with the fact that they're four real people in a real band that makes records for real people, but are also scripted characters in a fake TV band doing nothing except exactly what the director wants them to.They continually try to prove to themselves that they're free and can make any choice they want. But no matter what they try deliberately flubbing their lines in scenes from their TV show, pointing out to other characters that they're really just actors making a movie, complaining to producers Jack Nicholson and Bob Rafelson... who are on the set but not part of the film, smashing through the painted paper walls, walking off the set and into the street, physically attacking other actors for no reason, and making everyone they encounter mad at them they discover that their every word and deed was predetermined to the finest detail by the script of the movie they're in and the director directing it.For example, they forget their worries at a party where girls are go-go dancing. But a mirror on the wall reveals the movie camera shooting directly into it, recording the scene we are watching while Rafelson sits next to the camera in the mirror.At one point, Peter actually discovers the answer to the free will contradiction in their reality. The four frequently find themselves inside a large black box from which they cannot escape. The box represents the constraints of being fictional characters unable to make any real choices. Peter announces that he will talk about the nature of conceptual reality, then informs the others that ""it doesn't matter if we're in the box"". He realizes that the difference between free will and pre-scripted action is illusory. As long as you can do anything you want, 'it doesn't matter' if your choices were known in advance by some powerful entity in a higher level of context outside the universe, because the situation in which you find yourself is identical to one in which there is no outer context and you really are free.Unfortunately, the other three pay no attention to Pete's liberating revelation, which they characterize as navel-contemplating nonsense, and soon, even Pete forgets about it.While being chased by everyone they've encountered (and disrupted) in the various vignettes, they run onto a bridge, shoving people out of the way. We see that they weren't being ""wacky"" at the beginning of the film; they were desperately trying to escape being mere scripted puppets. Finally, we see that they went to the bridge to make the ultimate assertion of free will. They jump off the edge and commit suicide, falling a very long way and slamming into the water far below.However in the final scene, we see that this, too, was scripted. The film's director hauls their soaked bodies away in a huge aquarium while the four stare blankly through the glass, struggling under the water. Laughing, he rolls the aquarium into a slot at the studio warehouse, to be taken out when he wants to use them again in another movie.

"The Monkees are tossed about in a psychedelic, surrealist, plotless, circular bit of fun fluff.::Christina Dunigna <cdunigan@hotmail.com>"
"Running in from seemingly nowhere, Micky Dolenz, Davy Jones, Michael Nesmith & Peter Tork - better known collectively as The Monkees - disrupt a bridge opening ceremony. From where and why did they come to disrupt the proceedings? They were filming a series of vignettes in several different genres, including a wild west sequence, a desert war sequence, a Confederate war sequence, and a science fiction sequence. They disagree with much of what is happening around them, and try to figure out how to escape the oppression they feel - symbolized by a big black box in which they are seemingly imprisoned - by the forces around. That oppression is often shown in the form of ""The Big Victor Mature"".::Huggo"
"In this 1968 film, the Monkees valiantly attempted to deflate their own myth. The plot is, essentially, about demystification. Mickey Dolenz, Davy Jones, Peter Tork, and Mike Nesmith - with the aid of writer Jack Nicholson (the only credited author due to legalities)- tackle such topics as filmmaking, the media treatment and madness of the Vietnam War, Davy Jones' ""way with the ladies"", and, most importantly, commercialization. Each group member is presented in a unique light - in every case shattering the image that had been produced by the ""media machine"". The Monkees went out on a limb with this film by creating an almost surreal work with a loosely bound ""plot"". Their younger fans, unfortunately, simply missed the point. Because of the poor publicity of the film at the time of its release, older teenagers had no clue what ""Head"" was trying to say. As a result, its box office showing was disastrous. ""Head"" is more for the film enthusiast than the casual Monkees fan in some respects. The soundtrack does, however, feature some of the finest and most sophisticated music of the group's career. And yes, they DO play their own instruments on the tunes, but receive assistance in composing and performing from the likes of Neil Young, Stephen Stills, and Carole King.::Tony - Media Librarian, New York"

"Five 1990s Californian couples, wed but one, illustrate or contradict the sexual relationship theories of two TV talk show hosts.

"Michael (John Travolta) is not a stereotypical archangel. He epitomizes the freedom that an angel might command if living among mere mortals. As the tagline says, ""He's an angel, not a saint.""Two reporters, Frank Quinlan (William Hurt) and Huey Driscoll (Robert Pastorelli), one cynical and the other innocent, work for a tabloid newspaper in Chicago. (""Quinlan"" is a nod to one of the writers of the same name.) They travel to a sleepy hamlet in Iowa because Quinlan has received a letter from a woman, Pansy Milbank, (Jean Stapleton) who has an angel for tenant and he is able to convince his editor (Bob Hoskins) that they should visit her at the Milk Bottle Motel. She dies before their very eyes, and they ""persuade"" Michael to accompany them to Chicago. Traveling with them is an alleged angel expert, Dorothy Winters (Andie MacDowell) with whom they were saddled by their editor.Michael is in control of the entire trip. They stop when he says so because he causes their tire to go flat. He leads them in a fight in a bar for which they are jailed one night. And he resurrects the dog, Sparky, after it is runover by a truck.Throughout the story, there is romantic tension between the angel expert and Quinlan, the cynical reporter and Michael engineers their romance to the very end.The movie's climax comes when they finally arrive in Chicago and Michael breathes his last looking up at the Sears Tower. (Michael has a fascination for the biggest and tallest things in the world.) Michael wasn't dying; but he was exiting earth for his last time. Meanwhile, the angel expert is exposed as a spy for the manipulative editor, and she confesses that she was after Huey's job. In truth, she is a dog expert who was sent on the trip to befriend Sparky. Quinlan, who at one point was moving out of his cynicism, regresses and the story almost ends with the three traveling companions going their separate ways, knowing they had journeyed with an angel, but not understanding exactly what it meant.Finally, one night, Quinlan spots a figure that he thinks is Michael (who was lying about it being his last visit), and begins following him rapidly through the streets. He rounds one corner and careens into Dorothy, who apparently was following a Michael-clone herself. Their faith is restored, and their love blossoms once more. ""Marry me, Dorothy,"" says Quinlan. ""Yes,"" she replies. Then the scene freezes, and out pop Michael and Pansy Milbank -- we're left to ponder whether she became an angel when she died earlier, or that she was an angel all along -- and they dance through the frozen people until they merge with the light emanating from a car's headlights."

"Un hombre y una mujer caminan por una abarrotada calle, y se dedican a calibrar y admirar los paquetes de los hombres. Después, en una cafetería, toman algo, y él lee dos noticias: el científico español De la Peña que logró reproducir seis periquitos asexualmente y que el emperador de Tirana ha escapado a Estados Unidos y se refugia en una isla en Contadora (Panamá). La pareja de la mesa de al lado, vestidos como iban vestidos durante la Movida, se quejan de que no tienen dinero, y esnifan a la vista de todo el mundo. Otra noticia: Patty Diphusa, una estrella de porno, es entrevistada en una revista. Los tíos entablan conversación, ya que el que está leyendo paga toda las consumiciones de la pareja antes de que el camarero (Javier Ulacia) monte un escándolo con la pareja joven por no pagar. El joven le ofrece irse a su pisito de 60 metros. Ellos se van, pero la cámara se queda con Sexilia (Cecilia Roth), que está hablando con unos tíos para montar una fiesta en su piso con drogas y sexo.En un piso, dos tías están hablando. Una de ellas, Susana Díaz (Ofelia Angélica), come un montón, es una maruja regordeta que está planchando. La joven, Sexilia, le cuenta que ayer conoció a 8 ó 9 tíos y se los llevó a su casa a follar con ella sóla. Sexi dice que nunca invita a chicas a sus fiestas, porque ella sola puede con todas, y admite, satisfecha, que es una ninfómana, ""desde niña"". Susana le dice que la culpa es de su padre, que no se preocupa de ella y por eso Sexi lo odia, intentando vengarse de él follándose a todos los tíos. Susana le dice que ella también quiere tirarse al padre (Fernando Vivanco) de Sexi, el bioginecólogo doctor de la Peña, y lo llama a su consultorio. Él aduce que está muy ocupado y la rechaza: se supone que Susana es la psicóloga de Sexilia, como le dice el padre a una mujer, Toraya (Helga Liné), antigua emperatriz de Tirana.Susana y De la Peña se conocieron en una fiesta, pero Ana (Mercedes Juste) le dice que él está obsesionado con su trabajo. Sexilia no sale de su habitación durante el día porque odia al sol. Susana dice que es una ""psicóloga a la italiana"" y se ofrece para darle un tratamiento a Sexi.La emperatriz, a la que llaman Princesa, de acento italiano, está satisfecha de ser fertil, por fin. De la Peña le pregunta por el emperado, pero ella le dice que debe estar pasándolo muy mal por el cáncer, el exilio y demás circunstancias de su vida. Resulta que De la Peña lo conoció en una playa hacía 15 años. Resulta que el Emperador quería que la mitad de la nación llevase su sangre, y habla con un joven De la Peña , que acababa de publicar una artículo muy polémico sobre ginecológía y estaba veraneando en el mismo lugar. Princesa piensa que el emperador está un poco loco, y desde que la dejó a ella, todavía más.Afuera, dos pacientes hablan del tratamiento revolucionario; a una ya le ha funcionado, y lleva a la niña que nació para una revisión, mientras que la otra piensa que será feliz cuando sea finalmente madre. La madre (Eva Siva) dice que ahora no tendría a la niña Maricarmen (María del Carmen Castro), y la niña dice que la madre está de los nervios. La niña es muy maleducada, y contesta al médico. Princesa dice que Maricarmen es una niña probeta. La madre de Maricarmen no quería tener hijos, pero el tío con el que estaba sí los quería. Al final, buscaron esa solución, y en cuanto nació Maricarmen, el tío la dejó abandonada. La otra paciente (Zulema Katz) le aconseja que aproveche que es azafata para conocer a otros hombres. Sexi entra mientras Princesa sale, y la segunda comenta lo feliz que se siente ahora que ya es fertil; Sexi gruñe que para qué quiere eso. De la Peña se disculpa por la mala educación de su hija, y dice que su hija es un gran problema.Sexi dice que su psicóloga está muy loca, a lo que su padre le responde que la gente dice que es muy buena.En una tintorería, el dependiente (Luis Ciges) está tomando algo para que se le ponga dura (supongo que será algún antecedente de la Viagra). Sexi lleva un montón de ropa, y la dependienta Queti (Marta Fernández Muro) lo anota todo. Necesitarán cinco días. La dependienta se imagina con el vestido corto. Los de la lavandería son padre e hija. Resulta que la hija le pone betamuro en el té, para que se le pase el ansia sexual. El padre se acicala y Queti le pone crema en la espalda. El padre no quiere que Queti le llame papá, e intenta llevársela a la cama. El padre la ata a la cama y le dice que le encanta que tenga dos personalidades.En la revista del corazón Diez Minutos aparece Riza Niro (Imanol Arias) en portada. Es el hijo del Emperador, también exiliado. Sadec (Antonio Banderas) liga con el tío del principio en plena calle. Princesa le dice a Mohammed que ya es fertil, y que necesita conseguir semen del emperador. Se van los dos a follar. Resulta que Sadec es de Tirania, y Riza se entera porque hay una foto de él vestido como una mujer musulmana en el baño. Riza quiere irse inmediatamente al darse cuenta de que es paisano suyo, aunque él afirma se inglés pero que su madre era de Marruecos, y de repente tiene una prisa enorme. Parece que los tíos con los que Sadec está compartiendo piso son criminales que quieren secuestrar a Riza Niro, aunque el asunto va a estar complicado, porque entre otras cosas, ni Hassan (Agustín Almodóvar) ni Alí (Juan Carlos Quirós) saben dónde vive Riza Niro.Una sesión de fotos con Fabio (Fabio/Fany McNamara) como zombie salido. En esta sesión delirante, Pedro Almodóvar (Él mismo) dirige la broca que lo agujerea. Riza lo visita, porque quiere que lo cambie completamente. Resulta que se Riza Niro, con peluca horrorosa.En un concierto, Pedro y Fabio cantan mientras el grupo sustituto llega a la discoteca. Nana (Ana Trigo) protesta por el cambio en el programa, pero se consuela mientras come un plátano y le dicen que sugruo va a grabar un disco. Llega Eusebio (Ángel Alcázar) y su grupo como los sustitutos oficiales, pero él resbala, se cae por unas escaleras y su novia (Cristina Sánchez Pascual) tiene que llevarla al hospital. Encuentran un sustituto para el cantante, Riza Niro, porque se sabe la canción Gran Ganga. Resulta que ahora quieren que el sustituto firme un contrato con ellos.Sexi y Riza se miran, pero ella se va con dos tíos y él se va con otro, Santi (Javier Pérez Grueso) cada uno por su lado. Esa noche resulta que ninguno de los dos es capaz de tener relaciones sexuales satisfactorias. Sexi se cuela vestida como Caperucita Roja, y visita a Riza. Duermen juntos, y quiero decir que realmente duermen juntos, porque los dos han tenido una noche muy larga. Él dice que en un mes se vuelve a Panamá, en la isla Contadora. Sexilia se ofrece a irse con Riza adónde sea.Cuando ella se va, se encuentra a Queti andando por la calle vestida con su vestidito verde estampado. Sale corriendo del taxi para echárselo en cara. Queti dice que es fan de Sexi, que también canta en el grupo. Sexilia se ofrece al levar a Queti en taxi a su casa, y durante la conversación le pregunta por qué ella no está satisfecha con su propia vida, y ella le dice que está muy traumatizada. Ella le cuenta que su madre los abandonó hace unos meses, y que desde entonces, su padre la viola día sí - cuando se toma el afrodisíaco - y día no. Queti le dice que el antídoto no le hace efecto, y Sexi se ofrece a hablar con Paco, un amigo suyo que es químico.Sexi le pide a la criada (Marcela Amaya) que les prepare café. A Queti también le encanta De la Peña. Paco dice que el benzamuro es lo que pone paranoico al padre. Llegan las amigas del grupo de Sexi, Angustias (Concha Grégori) y Nana. Queti dice que es fan de Sexi y que le gustaría ser cantante como ella, y recomienda a Nana un remedio para que no se le resequen los labios. Nana saca unos consoladores porque acaba de decir que ya ha superado su timidez.Riza empieza a ensallar con el grupo  Ellos, en el que antes cantaba Eusebio. Éste y su novia aparecen en los ensayos. La discográfica prefiere a ""Johnny"". En la parada del bus, la novia lo consuela. Ella lo que quiere es casarse con él. En dos años que lleva en el grupo, Eusebio no ha ganado ni un duro, y ya no está para andar haciendo niñerías. Sadec huele a la novia de Eusebio. Resulta que Sadec tiene un olfato muy desarrollado, y ha olido que uno de ellos huele al tío que está buscando. Como Sadec no sabe cómo se llama el tío al que estaba buscando, Eusebio casi le pega con la muleta.Sadec vuelve a su piso con los dos terroristas, que todavía no han sido capaces de averiguar dónde está Riza Niro. Sadec les dice que con él no cuente, que al estar enamorado su olfato ya no funciona. Los amigos le dicen que sus mariconadas son menos importantes que todo el futuro del pueblo tiraní. Le lanzan la revista 10 Minutos, y es ahí cuando Sadec se da cuenta de que el tío del que está enamorado es Riza.Queti dice a su padre que se va a hacer la compra, pero en realidad se escapa con Sexi. Queti se sorprende de que ella todavía no haya follado con el tío que le gusta. Sexi se ha vuelto más discreta. Sexi ha pagado una cirugía estética para Queti.Ángel (Santiago Auserón) es un vendedor a domicilio que vende medallas. La madre de Angustias (Teresa Tomás), que está seleccionando unos sombreros, quiere librarse de él. Sin embargo, Nana quiere ligar con él, aunque resulta que ya se conocían. Se besan en el ascensor enfrente de unos abuelos que se escandalizan. Ahora su amor ya es posible porque Nana ya no tiene los labios resecos, ni se tira pedos.Sexi no quiere saber del pasado de Riza; de hecho, todavía no han follado, porque ella quiere respetarse.En el hotel, una camarera (Lupe Barrado) prepara la cama de Princesa y la de Riza y Sexi.

El padre de Queti está feliz de la vida. Ya se ha dado cuenta de que Queti se ha escapado.Susana corre detrás del doctor De la Peña en plena calle. Al final, y ante su insistencia, toman un café juntos. Susana le dice que él no se ha preocupado mucho por ella..., y que quiere tener sexo con él. De la Peña le dice que nunca le ha interesado demasiado el sexo, ni siquiera cuando era joven; siempre lo vio como algo sucio, e incluso por eso se dedicó a la inseminación artificial. Susana le dice que alguien tan atractivo y tan elegante tiene que pensar eso sólo por el trauma de que nunca se lo han hecho bien, pero al ver que él se va intenta retenerlo, incluso diciéndole que la niña tiene problemas.Toraya y Riza coinciden en el mismo ascensor. Un telegrama acaba de informar a Toraya que es imposible conseguir semen del emperado, pero que su hijo está en la habitación tres de su mismo hotel. Toraya se da cuenta de que el joven que tiene al lado es Riza Niro. Le dice ""chao"" y se quita las gafas, afirmando que se va a conocer mucho. Sexi llega a la habitación del hotel cuando Toraya ya se iba, pero se la encuentra. Mientras tanto, Riza está en el jacuzzi. Toraya dice que tenía una deuda con el pueblo tiraní, por eso se tiró al joven. Toraya le dice que ella fue la primera mujer de la vida de Riza, lo que enfurece todavía más a Sexi. Él intenta explicárselo, porque está enamorado de ella, pero ahora Sexi se dacuenta de lo malo que es el amor. Sale corriendo del hotel prometiéndose que nunca jamás volverá a enamorarse. Aún llorando, y destrozada, vuelve a la consulta de Susana Díaz.Susana se deshace de Alicia, la paciente a la que estaba atendiendo, porque Sexi está peor que ella. Alicia se one a chillar. Susana obliga a tomar un somnífero a Alicia, para que se quede tranquila. Susana abre la ventana de par en par, para que Sexi tenga que enfrentarse a sus miedos. Inmediatamente, Sexi empieza a recordar cuando ella era niña (Eva Carrero) y estaba en la playa. Toraya los vigila. Riza está enterrando a Sexi. Aparece Toraya, y se lleva a Riza. Sexi se levanta desorientada. Toraya está intentando seducir a Riza, que podría ser su hijo. Sexi dice a Riza que se vaya con ella. Toraya se pone pesada, y Sexi sa va llorando, porque piensa que Riza prefiere a Toraya. Ella acude a su padre, pero el doctor De la Peña le dice que no puede acuparse de ella en ese momento, que tiene que ir a hablar con un señor. Sexi se queda sola, tirada en la arena con el sol dándole en la cara y deslumbrándola. Unos niños estaban jugando al fútbol, pero al verla a ella, prepubescente, le preguntan si quieren jugar a ""maridos y mujer"" con ellos; es entonces cuando Sexi toma la decisión de ser la mujer de todos. Al final, Riza niño sí que estaba intentando librarse de Toraya. Le pega un empujón y se va. Ve cómo el círculo de niños le están quitando el bañador a Sexi. Uno de los niños se levanta y le susurra lo que ha pasado a Riza. Se van losdos, traumatizados. Sexilia vuelve a casa, donde sólo la espera la criada. Manuel Ángel (Paco Pérez Brián) la espera en la Calle Orellana para hacerse unas fotos. La criada quita el polvo del traje de Sexilia.Queti queda con Sexi. Ella le dice que ese novio es el hijo del emperador de Tirana. El camarero las mira mucho, así que se van al baño. Queti le dice que tiene que hablar con Riza - después de la cirugía estética, se parece muchísimo, así que será Queti quien tenga que ir a hacer las fotos a la calle Orellana. Melinda, la criada cubana, no se da cuenta de que es Queti y no Sexilia. La criada le dice que, antes de salir, hable consu padre, que está muy triste. De la Peña dice que está frustrado profundamente: los periquitos no cantan. Queti le da un montón del mejunge que se tomaba su padre - los periquitos. Inmediatamente, los periquitos cantan. Riza tiene que dejar el grupo aunque acaban de grabar el disco. Les da un montón de dinero para que se acuerden de él. Nana y Angustias se van a maquillar a una tienda de lámparas, donde la dependienta (Helena Ramos) les dice que las vio actuar en el Carolina, pero que estaban horrorosas.

En el fondo, Ouka Lele (Ella misma) con su cámara y Carlos García Berlanga (Él mismo) también está comprando. Nana y Angustias también dicen que el hijo del emperador de Tirana es Johnny.Queti y la novia de Eusebio se pelean. Eusebio llama al anuncio que pone en el periódico y denuncia a Riza.

"Security guards the bumbling and overweight Chuck (Gailard Sartain) and the taciturn Bobby (Bill Byrge) play a game of Red light/Green light while being night watchmen for Howard County Bank and Trust and are obsessed with elaborate schemes of would-be thieves. They hear a sound coming from a floor polisher that Ernest P. Worrell (Jim Varney) (who works as a night custodian but dreams of being a clerk) is trying to turn on for operation, but he ends up making a mess in the bank and he becomes magnetic from a mishap with the floor polisher.The next day, bank president Oscar Pendlesmythe's assistant, Charlotte Sparrow (Barbara Bush Tyson) orders him to clean up his supernatural mess. Pendlesmythe (Dan Leegant) arrives and wants to terminate Ernest's employment at the bank, but Charlotte has a soft heart for misfits and stray dogs, so she argues on his behalf.Ernest takes a bath at home in a tumble dry washing machine and uses a blow dryer with a wind tunnel force for his evening dinner with Charlotte in a restaurant. He later receives in the mail a summons to jury duty in court and tells the two watchmen about it.During the trial, Dracup Maximum Security Prison convict Rubin Bartlett (Barry Scott) notices that Ernest is a dead ringer for death row inmate Felix Nash (Jim Varney in a dual role) and has his lawyer convince the jury to tour the prison, where Ernest is kidnapped by Nash and another inmate named Lyle (Randall 'Tex' Cobb) and forced to switch places with Nash. Even though he tries to tell the guards he is not Nash, they refuse to believe him. Ernest also does not know that he has a death sentence, which is for Nash.While having lunch, a guard tells them to stand up and be quiet, when he notices Ernest is making a lot of noise, which almost sends him into the cell. Ernest tries to tell one of the prison guards that he is Ernest, not Nash, but the guard calls him ""Mr. Funny Man"" (which is a mistaken lie), angrily says that he is not funny, and is lying and throws him into the cell right in front of Lyle, who pushes him back. When he pushes him near the prison bars, he tells the guard that he was beaten up (and accidentally slamming the guard's head on the bars). The guard tells Ernest that he will be sent to the hole, which makes Ernest realize he is in jail. Bartlett tells him that Nash has assumed his identity and warns him to keep his mouth shut.Ernest makes several unsuccessful escape attempts, and is soon sent to the electric chair by the prison warden (Charles Napier). The electrocution fails, and Ernest is transformed into a type of superhuman, with the ability to shoot lightning bolts from his hands (that Ernest named himself 'Electroman'). To make his getaway, he blasts a hole in the main gates. However, Bartlett obstructs the escape and attempts to kill Ernest himself, only for Lyle to intervene, knock Bartlett unconscious and allow Ernest to make his escape, knowing that Ernest is different from everyone else. Lyle decides to stay behind because (speaking for the first time) he tells Ernest that he have been in prison most of his adult life and ""doen't belong out there"". Ernest says goodbye to Lyle and escapes just before Lyle is detained by the prison guards.Making his way home, Ernest discovers that his Pee-wee Herman-like decor has been replaced by a slick Lounge Lizard style of decorating and exclaims, ""I've been vandalized - by Elvis!"" Meanwhile, Nash is preparing to blast open the bank's vault with a time bomb, with Charlotte and an unconscious Chuck bound nearby. Charlotte begs Nash not to go through with it, and he blurts the truth about being an impostor. Charlotte doesn't believe it until he points out he's done a far better job cleaning the floors than Ernest ever had. Ernest arrives and he and Nash do battle. Ernest gets electrocuted yet again when Nash harshly throws him against an electric cage that the bank had rigged to drop from the ceiling to catch robbers. Now Ernest has become polarized and gained the ability to fly. He uses his super powers to fly through the skylight of the bank with the bomb which leads to a spectacular mid-air explosion. Everyone especially Chuck thinks that Ernest has been killed, until he falls through the skylight and lands on Nash, which leads the warden and the guards to find out Ernest was right all along. Ernest tiredly declares, ""I came, I saw, I got blowed up."" and then faints."

"A wealthy New Yorker wrestles with the decision to leave her cheating husband, as she and her friends discover that women really can have it all.::IMDb editor"
"Based on a very clever comedy by Claire Booth, wife of Time Publisher Henry Luce and later Ambassador to Italy. One of the surprises was an all-woman cast, novel in the 1930's. And although there were no men in the cast, most of the dialog was about them. The story is rather thin and depended on the fact that divorce, in the 1930's, was not only difficult but almost impossible in New York. Mrs. Stephen Haynes learns that her husband is seeing a salesgirl at Saks, and reluctantly divorces him, abetted by her friends, all of whom have romantic problems of their own. In the 1930's New York women who could afford it went to Nevada, where residency could be established quickly and divorce was relatively easy. The 1939 film, starring Norma Shearer, Paulette Goddard, Rosalind Russell, and Joan Crawford, was a hit. This one, with an even better looking cast, is definitely not, largely because someone tried to move a 1930's situation comedy into the present.::jojo.acapulco"
"To her New York society friends, Mary Haines is the perfect woman. She is kind, considerate, and is able to balance her work life as a designer for her father's family business with her role as loving wife of thirteen years to renowned Wall Street businessman Stephen Haines and mother to preteen Molly Haines, all the while still being able to do volunteer work. But slowly, the problems in Mary's life, which she was previously unaware of, start to show themselves. Instead of her father handing over the family business to her as she expects, he instead fires her, believing her work is not of quality since she is spreading herself too thinly over all that she does.

"The story opens with Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams), a comedian and host of a satirical talk show who is able to tap into people's frustrations with the sharply divided, special-interest driven political climate. During his warm-up act, an audience member suggests that he run for President. At first, Dobbs laughs off the idea, but following a popular groundswell of support, later announces on the air that he will stand as a candidate. Through his efforts, he gets on the ballot in 13 states and participates in one of the national debates with the Democratic Incumbent President Kellogg and Republican U.S. Senator Mills.A parallel plot follows Eleanor (played by Laura Linney), who works at a voting machine company called Delacroy. According to a television commercial in the movie, the entire United States will be using Delacroy voting machines for the presidential election. Shortly before the elections, Eleanor notices an error in the voting system, but the head of the company purposefully ignores her warnings. Initially, Dobbs approaches the campaign seriously - perhaps too seriously, to the chagrin of his staff, especially his manager Jack Menken (Christopher Walken). That turns around the night of the presidential debates, where, fed up with the posturing of the other candidates, he shifts back into comedian mode, managing to keep the audience laughing and make serious points simultaneously. From then on, he resumes his showman persona, thoroughly shaking up the political landscape. Dobbs surges in polls after the debates, but remains in a distant third to Kellogg and Mills.Election Day arrives and polls show Dobbs at 17% with Kellogg and Mills tied in the 40s. Dobbs performs better than expected, although not well enough to be close to either of the two major candidates. Early returns show Kellogg beating Mills everywhere. Eleanor says that this is part of the error in the voting systems. Then all of a sudden Dobbs starts winning states. He first wins in Virginia, then North Carolina, and then big states such as California, New York and Texas. He now stands at 146 electoral votes and the news states if he wins the remaining states he is on the ballot in, he will become President. Soon afterwards, results show that Tom Dobbs has indeed won the race for President, beating out Kellogg and Mills. Dobbs is extremely shocked - like the rest of the world. While Dobbs and his crew move from shock to celebration, Eleanor remains unconvinced. She considers revealing the computer error to the public, but is attacked in her home (presumably by Delacroy agents) and injected with a cocktail of drugs. Upon going to work, her behavior is erratic in the extreme, and she is hospitalized for drug overdose (and the company uses this as a pretext to fire her). Upon recovering in the hospital, she realizes that very few people would believe her story, but decides that if nothing else, she must tell Dobbs.Though still suffering from the aftereffects of the drugs in her system, Eleanor eventually makes her way to Jack Menken's birthday party. There, she unconvincingly impersonates an FBI agent but manages to catch Dobbs' eye, the two dance through the evening, and Dobbs gives her his telephone number. Eleanor cannot bring herself to tell Dobbs that he is not really the President-Elect. Later, Dobbs tries to get back in contact with Eleanor by calling Delacroy. This immediately raises the suspicions of the Delacroy leaders, and they redouble their efforts to silence Eleanor. Eleanor calls Dobbs and he whisks her off to a paintball fight, followed by Thanksgiving dinner. At dinner, she finally gets him alone to tell him that the elections were a fraud, then leaves.Dobbs wrestles with the idea that he should not have been elected as President and finally decides to break Eleanor's news to the public in a major speech. However, Delacroy pre-empts his announcement with one of their own, stating that Eleanor was caught attempting to throw the election for Dobbs, but that her efforts had no impact on the polls. Eleanor becomes increasingly fearful for her safety, a feeling that is soon justified as agents break into the hotel room where she is staying to confiscate her computer, the only evidence she had.Desperate, Eleanor first flees to a mall, where she is found by a Delacroy agent but escapes. She then drives to find a pay phone so that she can call Dobbs for help. She manages to reach him but is not able to communicate anything before the Delacroy agent's truck crashes into the phone booth; she escapes just before the collision but is still injured and is hospitalized a second time. Dobbs goes to the scene, and though he cannot understand what she is trying to say, he is convinced that she was telling the truth about the election. During the Weekend Update section of the sketch comedy tv show Saturday Night Live, he finally announces to the public that the elections were flawed and that he should not be President-elect.Dobbs declines to accept victory in a phony election, and another election is held in which Dobbs chooses not to participate. President Kellogg wins another term, though, perhaps chastened by the Dobbs phenomenon, is much more sensitive to the populace as a whole rather than the special interests, and Dobbs returns to his career as a talk-show host, with Eleanor at his side as his producer and wife. The executives of Delacroy were convicted of fraud. The last seconds of the film shows a mock TIME magazine Person of the Year cover with Dobbs chosen as Person of the Year, whereas in usual circumstances, TIME always awards that honor to the winner of the presidential election.

"At a Long Island railroad station, Frank ""the Cucumber"" DeMarco (Alec Baldwin) and Tommy (Paul Lazar), two Mafia associates, wait for the commuter train on which they will assassinate a person known only as 'The Fat Man' (Captain Haggerty), an enemy of crime lord Tony ""The Tiger"" Russo (Dean Stockwell). Before the train arrives, Tommy informs DeMarco that his wife, Angela (Michelle Pfeiffer), turned down an invitation to an important Mafiosi dinner party to which the DeMarcos were invited. DeMarco carries out the assassination flawlessly and leaves the dead Fat Man behind on the crowded train.Later that day, at her Long Island beauty parlor, Angela offends Tony's vain wife Connie (Mercedes Ruehl), as well as the other fellow Mafia wives, Rose (Joan Cusack), Theresa (Ellen Foley) and Phyllis (O-Lan Jones), by declining an invitation to a card game. At home, DeMarco confronts Angela about refusing social opportunities and jeopardizing his career, but she expresses dissatisfaction with their lifestyle and ill-gotten possessions. Breaking into tears, she claims, ""Everything we own fell off a truck."" Although she wants a divorce, DeMarco laughs at the suggestion and tells her to take a Valium.Soon after, DeMarco and several other Mafia gangsters gather at the King's Roost, a dinner club with a medieval castle theme. As several FBI agents surreptitiously watch, Tony gives a necklace to a waitress, Karen Lutnick (Nancy Travers). After dinner, Tony meets Karen in a hotel room to have sex, but then suspects that she has another tryst scheduled. Later in the evening, DeMarco enters Karen's hotel room and finds her soaking in the bathtub with a bullet in her head, just before Tony kills him.Meanwhile, FBI agent Mike Downey (Matthew Modine) surmises that Tony is guilty of the double murder and gains permission from his superior to work on the case. After DeMarco's funeral, Tony approaches Angela and forces a kiss on her. Unaware that Angela does not welcome Tony's overtures, FBI agents snap a photo of the act. Rose also sees the kiss. Despite Angela's claim to the contrary, the Mafia housewives presume Angela is pursuing Tony and confront her at the supermarket. Connie threatens to crush Angela and demonstrates with a carton of eggs.Taking action, Angela donates her house, car and all her furniture to charity and, with her 10-year-old son Joey (Anthony J. Nicci), moves to a tenement on Manhattan's Lower East Side. Mike and Ed Benitez (Oliver Platt), another FBI agent who has been staking out Angela, wire her apartment. When Mike accidentally encounters Angela in the apartment elevator, he introduces himself as a workman named Mike Smith. After attempting unsuccessfully to get a job at a department store cosmetics counter, Angela seeks employment at the Chicken Lickin' fast food restaurant, but leaves when she catches the manager spying on her as she changes into the store uniform.Eventually, Angela is hired at the ""Hello Gorgeous"" hair salon, where she works with Rita (Carol East), the manager.

Although Tony escapes by shooting all his attackers, he decides to set up a meeting with his Miami rivals to settle their differences.Mike and Angela are sharing intimate moments in her apartment, when Connie arrives looking for Tony and instead finds Mike. After she leaves, the defeated Angela explains to Mike that she is connected to the Russo crime family and unable to start a new life outside the mob. Mike then realizes he has misjudged Angela and tells her that she deserves a second chance. However, Mike's superiors at the FBI chastise him for his romantic interlude with Angela and bring her in for questioning. Mike's hostile boss, FBI Regional Director Franklin (Trey Wilson), threatens to send Angela to prison for donating stolen goods to charity and for illegal tax returns submitted by her now dead husband, and he also accuses her of colluding in DeMarco's murder. To put further pressure on Angela, he has Rita, her salon manager, arrested on immigration charges. When Angela complains that the FBI employs the same tactics as the mob, Franklin retorts that the ""mob is run by murdering, thieving, lying, cheating psychopaths"" while the FBI works for the President of the United States. Afraid that Joey will be placed in a foster home, Angela reluctantly agrees to cooperate with the FBI by flirting with Tony and gaining entrance into his world.Tony invites Angela to accompany him to Miami, where the meeting with his rivals will be held. Connie decides to surprise Tony and join him in Miami, but after learning he booked the honeymoon suite, she suspects that Angela is with him and flies to Miami with revenge on her mind.At the hotel, Tony gives Angela a gift and Angela, shaking with fear, reciprocates by giving him a ring that has a surveillance device inside it.

When Tony, realizes he has seen Mike several times, he orders his underlings to bring him to the honeymoon suite, where his identity as an FBI agent is revealed.

She slugs Angela to the floor and, claiming she has ""nothing to live for"", threatens to shoot and kill Tony.

When he arrives, Angela, remembering his comment about second chances, decides to give Mike a break and kisses him, and the crowd in the salon breaks into applause.A series of outtakes and deleted scenes are shown over the closing credits involving scenes of several more characters not seen or only glimpsed in the movie whom include Chris Isaak playing a clown, David Johanson playing a priest at DeMarco's funeral, and Joe Spinell playing a gangster named 'Tiptoes' Mazzilli attending DeMarco's funeral and who is later killed in another deleted scene by Tony."

"The film opens on a view of a pink trailer that seems to be located in a clearing near a rural wooded area. A voiceover narrator identifying himself as Mr. J (John Waters) discusses the current status of ""notorious beauty"" Divine (Divine), who has gotten tabloid attention due to her criminal career. The tabloids have given
Divine the title of ""Filthiest Person Alive"", and the coverage has forced her to disguise herself. She has adopted the alias of Babs Johnson and retreated to this rural trailer just outside Baltimore. She lives there with her son, Crackers (Danny Mills), and a young woman named Cotton (Mary Vivian Pearce), whom Mr. J identifies as Divine's ""traveling companion"". Also living in the trailer is Edie (Edith Massey), Divine's obese, senile mother.Inside the trailer, Edie has awakened and calls out to Babs; Edie sleeps in a playpen in the living room, wearing nothing but a bra, girdle and underpants. Edie demands that Babs bring her eggs, and we come to
understand that Edie is obsessed with eggs. When Babs doesn't respond soon enough, Edie tries to get Cotton to bring her eggs. Babs appears first, wearing a garish outfit. Her hair is an unnatural bright yellow
color, with an unusually high hairline and a fall attached.Babs and Edie have a brief discussion, with Babs being very patient and accomodating of her obviously feeble-minded mother. Edie calls the trailer a ""train"", and worries about when the Egg Man (Paul Swift) is going to stop by. Babs assures her that they still have eggs that she can prepare for her.Mr. J then discusses Connie (Mink Stole) and Raymond Marble (David Lochary), whom he calls ""two jealous perverts"" who are insanely jealous of Divine's fame. Connie is a strange looking woman with hair dyed bright red. We meet her as she is conducting a strange job interview in her home. She tells a young woman named Sandy Sandstone (Nancy Crystal) that she cannot offer her employment because she does not know
enough about Divine; apparently, the Marbles intend to spy on Divine and learn details about her lifestyle. Connie is a snobbish woman who belittles Sandy and infuriates her until she storms out in a rage. The film cuts back and forth between Divine's family and the Marbles, as they progress on a collision course with one another.Divine and Crackers go into town to run errands in Divine's Coup De Ville. Along the way, they deliberately run a jogger (Steve Waters) off the road and pretend to pick up a soldier (Elia Katz) hitch-hiking home, pulling away at the last minute before he can get in the vehicle, much to the amusement of Divine.Connie then meets with a lesbian couple (one of them Pat Lefaiver) who have come to her to adopt a baby. While Connie is talking to them, she sends her servant, Channing (Channing Wilroy) into the basement. There are two young women imprisoned down there, one dead (Marina Melin) and one alive and enraged. The dead woman has just given birth and Channing takes the baby upstairs so Connie can sell it to the lesbian couple. Before he leaves, the surviving girl, Susie (Susan Walsh), verbally berates Channing and curses him for his role in her kidnapping. She, too, is pregnant, and Channing is the father. Channing impregnates the women and gets rid of the bodies when they die in childbirth.After she parks the car, Crackers goes off on his own to make a date he has with a young woman. In a small grocery store, Divine shoplifts a steak from the butcher counter by discarding the wrapping paper and concealing the meat under her dress between her legs. She strolls through downtown Baltimore and turns the heads of passersby, then walks through a suburban neighborhood and urinates on the front lawn of a large stately home.We then see Raymond Marble, whose long hair is dyed bright blue. Raymond has a fetish for indecent
exposure; he lurks outside of an office building and follows two young women as they walk to a park to eat
their lunch. Raymond sneaks up behind them while wearing a bizarre mask, then opens his long coat to
reveal his penis hanging outside his pants with a long piece of sausage attached to it. The girls run off screaming and he takes the purses they have left behind.Later, Raymond and Connie welcome Cookie (Cookie Mueller) to their home. Cookie is a young woman who tells the Marbles that she can get them information about Divine because she is Crackers's date for the afternoon. The Marbles reveal their scheme: learn about Divine's private life and find the best way to disgrace her, while simultaneously seizing her title as ""The Filthiest Person Alive"". The Marbles tell Cookie about their baby ring, and they reveal that they also own several pornography shops and front money to heroin pushers in elementary schools. They feel that this is much filthier than Divine, and are resentful of the attention she has gotten.Cookie and Crackers go back to the trailer, where Cookie has a private conversation with Edie. Edie reveals that it is Babs's birthday and a party is planned. She also tells Cookie a few things about their home life. Meanwhile, Crackers excitedly talks to Cotton about his date, and tells her he has something special planned. Cotton is a voyeur who likes to watch Crackers in sex acts with women, and insists that Crackers never touch her personally.After introducing her to Cotton, Crackers takes Cookie to the little shed behind the trailer that he uses as
a private bedroom. Inside, Crackers and Cookie are naked on the dirty cot, and Crackers shoves two live
chickens at Cookie's nude body while she screams in horror. The chickens claw large scratches on her body, and in the process become crushed and killed between the bodies of Crackers and Cookie. Crackers slits the throat of one chicken and the blood gets all over the two of them. Cotton watches all of this from the window of the shed, shuddering in ecstasy.Immediately afterwards, the Egg Man pays a visit to the trailer, calling out as he arrives. Edie hears him and becomes excited, screaming out for him as if she's afraid he will not stop otherwise. Cotton arrives and invites the Egg Man to Babs's birthday party, then she buys all of the Egg Man's eggs for Edie.Back at the Marbles, Raymond and Connie are making love by sucking each others toes, and we can see that their pubic hair is dyed to match the bright blue and red color of their hair. A phone call from Cookie interrupts them and she gives them the information she has collected about Divine's living arrangement and her birthday party. ""You have no idea what I had to go through to get that information!"" she tells them. The Marbles are thrilled that they know personal details about Divine, and they send her a surprise package in the mail--the address simply reads ""Babs Johnson, A Trailer, Phoenix, Maryland"".At the trailer, Divine prepares the steak she shoplifted and feeds it to her family. A postman (Bob Skidmore) interrupts their dinner, and Divine confronts him angrily, furious that someone has dared to approach the trailer. When he runs off, she unwraps the package to discover human excrement inside. A birthday card announces that Divine is no longer The Filthiest Person Alive. Divine flies into a rage, swearing vengeance for the obscene gesture.Connie and Raymond kidnap Linda (Linda Olgeirson), another young woman, after picking her up while hitch-hiking. They drug her and have Channing place her in the basement, where Susie begins to rant at him again. Channing, who is disgusted that part of his job is to have sex with unconscious women and get them
pregnant, has devised a new method: he masturbates into his hand and uses a syringe to inject the semen into Linda's vagina.Things progress. The Egg Man proposes marriage to Edie and she accepts, and he promises to take her to a large poultry factory for their honeymoon. The birthday party goes ahead as planned, with scores of guests indulging in all sorts of decadent behavior. Raymond and Connie, aware of the party, sneak up into the woods and watch from a distance as Divine snorts drugs with a friend, a woman performs a striptease with a snake, and in one of the movie's most memorable moments, a nude man throws his legs over his head an demonstrates his unusual ability to make his anus dilate rapidly over and over. Raymond and Connie are shocked at this display, and promptly phone the police to report Divine's party. The police arrive, but Divine and her group assassinate them with their bare hands, ripping their bodies apart and eating them raw as in ""Night of the Living Dead"".Connie and Raymond, gloating over the fact that they've called the cops on Divine, return home to discover Channing dressed in Connie's clothes, imitating both Raymond and Connie. Furious, they lock him in his ""room"", which is really just a closet. They then set out for their final act of vengeance: to burn down Divine's trailer. Raymond finds time to stop at the local park to commit another act of indecent exposure, but he is horrified when his victim, a lovely young woman putting on makeup in the park, opens her dress to reveal that ""she"" has male genitals. She laughs with glee as Raymond runs off.Divine and Crackers, having learned of the Marbles through gossip, invade the Marble residence, licking the furniture and rooms to ""curse"" the house. To further contaminate the dwelling, Divine and Crackers commit an act of incest, with Divine performing oral sex on him. They are interrupted by the sound of Channing, still locked inside the closet. They tie him up and intimidate him into telling them about Connie and Raymond. He also mentions the girls in the basement, and they take him downstairs to verify it. Sure enough, the imprisoned girls are there. Divine and Crackers disapprove of this variety of depravity committed by the Marbles, and they free the girls, allowing them to castrate Channing as an act of revenge.Meanwhile, the Marbles invade Divine's trailer, now empty due to Edie's departure with her new husband. They pour gasoline all over and ignite it, delighting in their final act of aggression toward their enemy. After the Marbles run off, Divine returns with Crackers and Cotton to find the trailer ablaze. Beside herself with sorrow and rage, she sets out to seize the Marbles immediately.When the Marbles return home, they discover their house has been contaminated. Their sofa and chair ""reject"" Connie and Raymond, spitting them onto the floor when they try and sit. The rest of the house reacts similarly as the Marbles walk through it in a panic. Discovering Channing's ""room"" empty, they wonder if he's set the girls free. In the basement pit, they find Channing's body, castrated and bled out. The girls are gone.Connie and Raymond assume the girls have sent for the police and they try to flee, but Divine, Cotton, and Crackers are waiting for them in the living room. They abduct the Marbles, tying them up and taping their mouths shut, and drag them back to the site of the trailer for a ""trial"" and execution.Divine summons the local tabloid press for exclusive coverage of the event. Representatives from three tabloids arrive and witness the mock trial for Connie and Raymond. Crackers and Cotton provide testimony and pronounce the verdict and punishment: guilty, with the death penalty to follow. After tarring and feathering the bound couple, Divine executes them with a handgun.The reporters thank her for the scoop and depart to write their articles, while Divine has a discussion with Cotton and Crackers about their next move. They decide to change their appearances and move to Boise. Mr. J discusses their reputation in the last scene of the movie, which depicts the trio preparing to leave Baltimore for Boise. Divine spots a small dog moving its bowels, and in one movement, she kneels down and picks up the excrement and puts it in her mouth, chewing it briefly before spitting it out. The camera zooms in for a closeup of her face as she smiles and ends the movie.Pat Moran...Patty Hitler (Party Guest In Nazi Uniform)Jack Walsh...Party GuestJackie Sidel...Party GuestJulie Munshauer...

"Very early in the morning at Camp North Star, an alarm clock wakens the head counselor, Tripper. He dons a kid's space cadet helmet and switches on the camp's PA system. His public service announcement informs the camp's counselors that they should get out of bed and report to for their assigned duties. He also expects that the summer session at the camp will be fun. Tripper forgets to turn the microphone off and takes it into the bathroom with him. The sound of a toilet flushing is heard across the camp. The other counselors are seen doing landscaping, painting, replacing windows and generally getting the camp ready.At the rendezvous for the campers, Tripper has his staff gather the kids and get them on the buses. Some of the kids have bad attitudes and have to be threatened with bodily harm. One of the counselors, Spaz, a nerdy type with taped-together glasses, is met by some counselors from North Star's rival summer camp, Mohawk. They seize his milkshake and pour it over his head. A news reporter is doing a story on Mohawk, which has a much richer budget, a long waiting list, stringent approval standards and seems like a luxury for its campers. Tripper talks to the reporter, posing as Mohawk's program director and gives him bogus information about the camp's activities, including ""Sexual Awareness Week"" when prostitutes are brought into the camp and the campers earn prizes for cavorting with as many as they can.Among the campers is a young kid named Rudy. Shy and lacking in self-confidence, he doesn't want to go to camp but his father insists. The buses bring the campers to North Star where they're assigned to their counselors and cabins. The head of the camp is Morty, a clumsy but likeable leader. He hands Tripper a list of rules for the camp, which Trip promptly tears up and throws in a trash bin.At chow, the camp's gossip expert informs everyone that several romances are brewing or continuing among the counselors, much to their embarrassment. Rudy participates in his first ever soccer game and accidentally scores on his own goalie. He's ridiculed and stalks off hurt. He packs his things and walks to the nearby town to catch a bus home. Tripper shows up and talks to Rudy in a kind tone, telling him that he just needs to make a few friends and he'll have a great summer. If anyone gives him any trouble, Trip tells him to go directly to him.Rudy and Tripper become friends, Rudy joining him for morning runs and staying up late to play cards - Tripper is no match for the budding card shark in Rudy, who takes home nearly all the peanuts they'd been using for wagers. Seeing a few good character traits in Rudy, Tripper later puts him in charge of making the PA announcements while he takes the counselors-in-training (CITs) on an overnight trip. At the overnight, Tripper and the other head counselor, Roxanne, become closer, despite Tripper's previous unwanted advances.North Star heads over to Camp Mohawk for the annual basketball game. North Star has continually lost to the ringer athletes of Mohawk, who also cheat to win. With his team many points in the hole, Tripper tells them they can lose with self-respect: at the next tip-off, the North Star players yank the shorts of their rivals down to their ankles and run. Joined by the North Star spectators and Tripper, they make it to their bus and triumphantly race back to their camp, Tripper proclaiming ""This is the proudest day in North Star history!""Parent's Day arrives, with Morty, his bed and his nightstand hung from a tree near the camp's entrance as a prank by Tripper and his CITs. Rudy's father is unable to come to the event and he spends the day jogging with Tripper around the woods.The big event of the summer is the Olympiad that takes place between Mohawk and North Star. North Star has lost consistently to Mohawk for the past 13 years, primarily because they can't match the skill of the Mohawk athletes but also because Mohawk is notorious for cheating. Beating North Star at several events, Mohawk takes an early and seemingly insurmountable lead in points. When all hope seems lost, Tripper rallies everyone in the camp. North Star begins to cheat just as cleverly as Mohawk does and they begin a solid comeback, winning in a speed swimming event, a wrestling match, the sauce/teacup contest (won by the klutzy Spaz) and in the hot dog eating contest, where the chubby CIT Fink is able to beat Mohawk's champion, The Stomach, while Tripper frantically coaches him and massages his stomach.Morty announces that they're only 20 points behind Mohawk and can win with the final event, a short, cross-country run. Unfortunately, North Star's best runner, Jackie, was fouled during the field hockey game by two Mohawk players and is out with a broken ankle. Tripper volunteers Rudy, saying he's been running with him all summer and is in shape enough to win. Rudy immediately objects but Tripper tells him he has the utmost confidence in him. He tells him that he probably can't outrun Mohawk's runner on the open road but when the course enters the woods, he can outpace him because he's smaller and able to avoid a lot of the foliage.The run begins and Rudy paces his opponent steadily until they enter the woods. Rudy takes off, outdistancing his opponent, gaining a solid lead. When they hit the homestretch, Rudy is able to keep his lead and finishes the victor. The camp rallies to Rudy as the camp champion.
Tripper and Roxanne escort Rudy back to his cabin that night where Rudy is greeted heartily by his mates. Tripper takes the CITs to a final campfire where they all drink champagne to celebrate their victory with Morty. They all sing a song about the more rotten aspects of being camp counselors. Tripper talks to Roxanne about moving in with him back home. Roxanne says she'll join him.The next morning, everyone prepares to go home. Rudy is asked by one of his mates if he'd like to come to a camp his father is opening. Rudy turns him down, saying he'll return to North Star. Roxanne suggests they say goodbye to Morty: out on the lake, Morty has been placed on a raft with his bed and nightstand to drift until he wakes up. Tripper gathers everyone together for the ride out, taking Roxanne with him on his motorcycle.On the lake, Morty wakes up to find he's stranded while the credits roll."

Josie desperately wants to be a reporter, and constantly sends story ideas to her boss, Gus (John C. Reilly), who appreciates her eagerness but does not believe she is up to the challenge of being a reporter. Josie is disillusioned with her life and avoids other people, which puzzles her promiscuous co-worker Anita (Molly Shannon). One day during a staff meeting, the tyrannical editor-in-chief, Rigfort (Garry Marshall) assigns her to report undercover at a high school to help parents become more aware of their children's lives. Josie is overjoyed, but Anita and Gus think its a bad idea, and that she will get fired. But she asserts herself and hurries to tell her younger brother, Rob (David Arquette), a former high school baseball champion who works at a postage and packaging store named the Tiki Post and is similarly disillusioned with life.Rob thinks it is a terrible idea for Josie to go undercover as a student, and reminds her of her own awful high school career, where she was a misfit treated with contempt and cruelty by her peers, and was labelled ""Josie Grossie"". A nickname which continues to haunt her, along with her misery at being treated so brutally. Josie has never had a romance due to her insecurities. She is unnerved, but is determined to undergo the assignment.Her first day at South Glen South High School is miserable.

"During a battle in the last months of World War I, the protagonist, an unnamed soldier (known only in the credits as A Jewish Barber), is fighting for the Central Powers in the army of the fictional nation of Tomainia, comically blundering through the trenches in combat scenes. Upon hearing a fatigued pilot pleading for help, the Barber attempts to rescue the exhausted officer, Commander Schultz. The two board Schultz's nearby airplane and fly off, barely escaping enemy ground fire. Schultz reveals that he is carrying important dispatches that could win the war. However, the plane loses fuel and crashes in a marsh. They both survive, but the Barber suffers from memory loss. As medics arrive, Commander Schultz gives them the dispatches, but is told that the war has just ended and Tomainia lost.Years later, as the Barber is released from the hospital, Adenoid Hynkel (also played by Chaplin), the ruthless dictator of Tomainia, has undertaken to persecute Jews throughout his country, aided by Secretary of the Interior and Minister of Propaganda Garbitsch and Minister of War Herring. The symbol of Hynkel's fascist regime is the ""double cross"", and at times, when he's excited or angry, Hynkel speaks in a macaronic parody of the German language. During his first speech, his Tomainian is ""translated"" by an overly concise English-speaking news voice-over.The Barber, unaware of Hynkel's rise to power, returns to his barbershop in the Jewish ghetto. When he opposes the painting of the word ""Jew"" on his barber shop by storm troopers, he flees from them, aided in part by his neighbor, Hannah, who knocks some of them unconscious with a frying pan. The Barber is nearly lynched by a gang of storm troopers, but Schultz, now a high-ranking officer in Hynkel's regime, intervenes. Though surprised to see the man who saved his life at the end of the war is not an Aryan, as he previously imagined, he returns the favor by ordering the storm troopers to take no action against him or Hannah, even when she throws an object at a storm trooper's head.Hynkel relaxes his stance on Tomainian Jewry in an attempt to woo a Jewish financier into giving him a loan to support his regime. Egged on by Garbitsch, Hynkel has become obsessed with the idea of being Dictator of the World, dancing at one point with a large, inflatable globe, to the tune of the Prelude to Act I of Richard Wagner's Lohengrin.Hynkel plans to invade the neighboring country of Osterlich (Austria), and needs the loan to finance the invasion. When the Jewish financier refuses due to the persecution of the Jews, Hynkel reinstates and intensifies his persecution of the Jews contrary to Garbitsch's advice. When Schultz, who is empathetic to the Jews, voices his objection to the pogrom, Hynkel denounces Schultz as a supporter of democracy and a traitor, and orders him placed in a concentration camp. The Barber evades storm troopers who have heard of the arrest by hiding on his neighbor Mr. Jaeckel's roof with Hannah, however his shop is burnt down. Schultz flees to the ghetto and begins planning to overthrow the Hynkel regime with Hannah, the Barber and other residents there. Schultz proposes a suicide mission to blow up the palace, the agent will be chosen by a coin in a pudding. However Hannah causes this to be abandoned by placing coins in all the puddings. Later the Ghetto is searched for Schultz. He and the Barber, hiding on the roof, are captured and condemned to the camp.Hynkel is initially opposed by Benzino Napaloni, dictator of Bacteria, in his plans to invade Osterlich, and even plans to declare war. However just after he signs a declaration of war he receives a call from Napaloni. He invites him and his wife to his palace and a seeing of a military show to impress him with a display of military might and psychological warfare, but this ends in disaster. After some friction, a comedic food fight between the two leaders, and a deal between the two leaders on which Hynkel immediately reneges, his invasion proceeds. Hannah and others from the Ghetto had emigrated to Osterlich to escape Hynkel, but once again they find themselves living under Hynkel's regime.Schultz and the Barber escape from the camp wearing Tomainian uniforms. Border guards mistake the Barber for Hynkel, to whom he is nearly identical in appearance. Conversely, Hynkel, on a duck-hunting trip, falls overboard and is mistaken for the Barber and arrested by his own soldiers. The Barber, now forced by circumstance to assume Hynkel's identity, is taken to the capital of Osterlich to make a victory speech. Garbitsch, in introducing ""Hynkel"" to the throngs, decries free speech and argues for the subjugation of the Jews. The barber then makes a rousing speech, reversing Hynkel's antisemitic policies and declaring that Tomainia and Osterlich will now be a free nation and a democracy. He calls for humanity in general to break free from dictatorships and use science and progress to make the world better instead.Hannah, now an impoverished laborer in a vineyard in Osterlich, hears the barber's speech on the radio, and is amazed when the Barber addresses her directly: ""Hannah, can you hear me? Wherever you are, look up, Hannah. The clouds are lifting. The sun is breaking through. We are coming out of the darkness into the light. We are coming into a new world, a kindlier world, where men will rise above their hate, their greed and brutality. Look up, Hannah. The soul of man has been given wings, and at last he is beginning to fly. He is flying into the rainbow into the light of hope, into the future, the glorious future that belongs to you, to me, and to all of us. Look up, Hannah. Look up!"" As she rises, Mr. Jaeckel asks Hannah, ""Hannah, did you hear that?"" The girl silences him with a gesture, saying, ""Listen,"" and turns her face, radiant with joy and hope, toward the sunlight"
Dictator Adenoid Hynkel tries to expand his empire while a poor Jewish barber tries to avoid persecution from Hynkel's regime.::Anonymous
"20 years after the end of WWI, in which the nation of Tomainia was on the losing side, Adenoid Hynkel has risen to power as the ruthless dictator of the country. He believes in a pure Aryan state and the decimation of the Jews. This situation is unknown to a simple Jewish Tomainian barber who has been hospitalized since a WWI battle. Upon his release the barber, who had been suffering from memory loss about the war, is shown the new persecuted life of the Jews by many living in the Jewish ghetto, including a washerwoman named Hannah with whom he begins a relationship. The barber is ultimately spared such persecution by Commander Schultz, whom he saved in that WWI battle. The lives of all Jews in Tomainia are eventually spared with a policy shift by Hynkel himself, who is doing so for ulterior motives. But those motives include a desire for world domination, starting with the invasion of neighboring Osterlich, which may be threatened by Benzino Napaloni, the dictator of neighboring Bacteria. Ultimately Schultz, who has turned traitor against Hynkel's regime, and the barber may be able to join forces to take control of the situation, using Schultz's inside knowledge of the regime's workings and the barber's uncanny resemblance to one of those in power.::Huggo"
"During the last days of the First World War, a clumsy soldier saves the life of devoted military pilot Schultz. Unfortunately, their flight from the advancing enemy ends in a severe crash with the clumsy soldier losing his memory. After many years in the hospital, the amnesia patient gets released and reopens his old barber shop in the Jewish ghetto. But times have changed in the country of Tomania: Dictator Adenoid Hynkel, who accidentally looks very similar to the barber, has imposed his merciless grip on the country, and Jewish people are discriminated against. One day the barber gets in trouble and is brought before a commanding officer, who turns out to be his old comrade Schultz. The ghetto enjoys protection from then on. Meanwhile, Dictator Hynkel develops big plans: he wants to become Dictator of the whole world and needs a scapegoat for the public. Soon Schultz is being arrested for being too Jewish-friendly, and all Jews except those who managed to flee are transported into Concentration Camps. Hynkel is planning to march into Osterlich to show off against Napaloni, Dictator of Bacteria, who has already deployed his troops along the small country's other border. Meanwhile, Schultz and the barber manage to escape, disguised in military uniforms. Luckily, Schultz and the barber are picked up by Tomanian forces and the barber is mixed up with Hynkel himself. The small barber now gets the once-in-a-lifetime chance to speak to the people of Osterlich and all of Tomania, who listen eagerly on the radio.::Julian Reischl <julianreischl@mac.com>"

All he needs is three dates and usually after that third date its love - he pretty much can guarantee that.We then see a flashback to when Alex was in college. He is definitely not the coolest person on campus (go back to Fresh Prince era with glasses). He meets a girl and they instantly click and we see them kissing and Alex explains to her how he is in love with her and we think she feels the same (maybe not as much as him), but he finds her in a car with another guy making out. Alex is upset and screams that he just wants to know why this has happened"" and all she can say is she is sorry.That basically explains why he wanted to start the secret ""date doctor"" business. The only men he will help are ones that are referred to him. We also see in the beginning a woman named Sara Melas (Eva Mendes) going back to work from a short vacation with big news about a man who cheated on an heiress named Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta). While Sara was on vacation she spotted the cheating man on the same beach she was at and had to come back to work to write the article for her gossip column in the New York Standard. This pleases her boss and he praises her for her hard work, but questions that she may be working too hard at her job and not at her personal life. She doesn't seem to concerned and blows the subject off.That evening we see Hitch out at a bar with a pal playing pool. Hitch has to prove to his pal that he can get any girl to come over and talk to them and he seems very confident. At this same time we see Sara at the same bar talking to her friend Julie( Julie Ann Emery) Julie is explaining to Sara about a guy she met at a lingerie store and how he said he was there buying something for his mother and they exchanged phone #'s. Sara doesn't buy it and says that the guy was definitely not there to buy something for his mother, but Casey seems desperate enough to believe the guy.The next day we see Hitch standing outside of a building watching an overweight man who is very clumsily eating a hot dog. Hitch is amused at how awful this guy seems and introduces himself to the man who's name is Albert. (Kevin James) Albert explains that he needs Hitch's help in getting to know a woman who he is head over heels for. It turned out to be Allegra Cole (the heiress whose boyfriend was caught cheating on her). Albert also works for Allegra as one of her financial advisers. Hitch is highly amused that Albert would even go as far as to liking a woman like Allegra, but he agrees because he can see that Albert is sincere and does seem to have true feelings for Allegra.Then begins the training that Albert has to do to get close to Allegra. Hitch tells him the first thing he should try to do is something over the top impressive to Allegra. We see Albert in a business meeting with his fellow colleagues and Allegra. Allegra has a suggestion for how she would like to spend some of her fortune and explains that she has a friend named Maggie that is wanted to start a fashion line and she would like 1/2 million dollars to invest in this. The lead adviser says that he thinks it can be worked out, but he wants a month to make arrangements. This disappoints Allegra because it is something she really wants now. Albert speaks up and begins to take sides with Allegra, saying that this is her money, she should do what she wants with it and since she is an adult she shouldn't have to ask what she should to with it. The lead adviser is shocked by Albert's reaction, but in the end Albert said he would just quit this job.He goes back in his office where Hitch is. Albert is so uptight about what happened and takes out his asthma medicine. Hitch and Albert have a scuffle so Albert can calm down. During the scuffle Allegra knocks on the door and tells Albert she is shocked about what just happened, but wants to get with him this week to go over some things about the plan for her friend's fashion line. He nervously agrees while Hitch is never seen behind the door.That night Hitch is back at the bar we saw him before, as is Sara. We see a man coming on strong to her and she politely says she isn't interested but he won't go away. Hitch sees what is going on and comes over and acts like he is with Sara. He asks her how her meeting was and she plays along and the man takes the notion that they are really together. Hitch and Sara have a flirty conversation about dating and they introduce themselves, but Hitch leaves the conversation short, leaving her extremely interested and impressed.The next day we see Sara get a package at her work place. It ends up being walkie talkies and Hitch is on the other line he asks her to go out on jet skis with him. She turns him down once, but he is persistent and she agrees to and then she receives another package from him with a wet suit inside. The date ends up horrific. Will kicks her off her jet ski, he digs up some information about her family history which he thinks she will be impressed with, but it also turns out to be bad, but she isn't too upset in the end and we think they will see each other again.We also see Hitch help Albert plan a day with Allegra. This time they are going to a fashion event to meet her friend Maggie. Hitch helps him learn how to dance properly, but he doesn't get it. The date isn't perfect by no means. Albert meets Maggie, who ends up being a man, so he is a bit tongue tied as to what to say. He also dances awful and reporters capture it with their cameras, but Allegra seems to be having a good time with him.The twist now comes into play. Hitch meets a prospective client named Vance. (Jeffery Donovan) Vance says he just wants to get in bed with someone he met a lingerie store (Sara's friend Casey) and thinks Hitch will be able to help him to that fast. Hitch doesn't like this guy at all and tries to leave, but Vance thinks money can change his mind. Hitch explains that this job isn't to help men like him and leaves.We then see Sara and her boss discussing gossip that got out about Allegra being at an event with an unknown man (Albert). He is upset that Sara didn't get the scoop and wants to know what is going on. Sara finds out that Hitch is the one who got the tickets to this event for Allegra and Albert. She asks him how he knows them. He says he doesn't know them and tries to deny it.Later, Sara asks him to dinner and her boss ends up being there and they both try to get more info on Allegra and Albert. While they are eating Hitch begins to have trouble swallowing and begins to have an allergic reaction to the food. He swells up like a balloon and gets drugged up on Benedryl. Sara again tries to get more info out of him, but he doesn't really budge, but does tell him that the two are going to the Knicks game tomorrow night. Sara ends up going to the game to get photos of them for her column.The next day we see Casey upset about her date last night. She slept with the guy at the lingerie store, but he had left her in a hurry. She said she would like to kick the date Dr. that so called helped the man she went out with. Sara finds the jerk that Casey went out with to see who this date Dr. is. All he can tell her is where she could find him he doesn't know his name. So, she sets this date Dr. up to meet a guy friend of hers on a fake meeting. She finds out that the date Dr. is Hitch and is upset but runs off instead of asking him what is going on.She is so upset that she ends up writing a gossip article on him exploiting the situation without getting the right facts. She also includes Albert and Allegra in this so Allegra thinks that everything was an act. Albert is crushed and Hitch is ruined.Hitch is upset that Sara didn't get the facts before writing the article. She ends up learning the truth and apologizes to Hitch, but he is too upset to accept this and blows her off. Later, we see Hitch preparing to move out of his apartment and Albert comes in to ask Hitch if he can fix this situation. Hitch is bitter about everything and thinks love is over rated. Albert tells him that Hitch was a liar for what he did to all the men he helped. He shouldn't help men out with love if he doesn't believe in it.Albert leaves upset and Hitch begins to think about everything. He decides to help Albert and runs to meet Allegra to tell her that Albert wasn't acting about how he feels for her. that all the dorky things he did on their dates was really him. Allegra believes him and she takes Albert back.Hitch then goes to Sara to tell her his feelings, but he has a difficult time. Now, he is the one needing a date Dr. to get his words right. Sara isn't buying it and tries to tell him to leave, but he doesn't. He ends up telling her how he feels about her, but Sara opens the door and there is another man there. Sara says its to late and starts to leave with the man. Hitch goes after them and he jumps on their car and she finally stops. The man ends up being her brother in law and she takes Hitch back. They have a sweet reunion and in the end we see Albert and Allegra at their wedding. Everyone's happy."

"Best in Show is presented as a documentary of five dogs and their owners destined to show in the Mayflower Kennel Club Dog Show, held in Philadelphia. The documentary jumps between the owners as they prepare to leave for the show, arriving at the hotel, and preparing backstage before their dog takes the show. The owners and their dogs include:Gerry and Cookie Fleck (Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara), with their Norwich Terrier Winky. They are a middle-class couple from Florida who run into monetary problems and are forced to sleep in the hotel's storage room when they finally arrive. Throughout the film, they encounter men that Cookie had slept with during her youth.Meg and Hamilton Swan (Parker Posey, Michael Hitchcock), with their Weimaraner Beatrice. An upper-class, stereotypical yuppie couple, they take great care in Beatrice (although really just confusing and aggravating her with their neurotic behavior), going as far as taking her to a therapist after she saw Meg and Hamilton have sex. At the show, the Swans believe that Beatrice will become unnerved without her favorite toy, the ""Busy Bee"", and frantically search for a replacement for it before the show.Harlan Pepper (Christopher Guest) and his Bloodhound Hubert. The Peppers have raised bloodhounds for generations, and Harlen continues the tradition, though he has aspirations of becoming a ventriloquist.Sherri Ann (Jennifer Coolidge) and Leslie Ward (Patrick Cranshaw) Cabot with their standard poodle Rhapsody in White (a.k.a. Butch), a two-time winner of the show in the past. Sherri Ann is a luscious big-breasted blonde, having the elderly Leslie as her sugar daddy. She is primarily worried about giving Rhapsody a makeover; however, trainer Christy Cummings (Jane Lynch) makes sure the dog is ready for the show, while Leslie stays utterly oblivious and apathetic. Over the course of the film, the fake couplehood between Sherri Ann and Leslie crumples while Sherri Ann's romantic involvement with Christy becomes apparent.Scott Donlan (John Michael Higgins) and Stefan Vanderhoof (Michael McKean) and their Shih Tzu. The gay couple takes great pride in their dog, and are confident that she will win the competition. They gossip about the other participants throughout the film.The owners and their dogs all arrive in time for the show, which is hosted by Trevor Beckwith (Jim Piddock), and ""color"" commentator Buck Laughlin (Fred Willard). During the first round, Beatrice is disqualified when Hamilton cannot control her, but the other four dogs advance to the final round. Just before the finals, Cookie stumbles and insists that Gerry take over for her. Though the audience is initially awed by seeing Gerry's ""two left feet"" (the result of a birth defect), ultimately Winky takes Best in Show.Afterwards, the film explores what each character is doing after the competition. Gerry and Cookie returned home to Florida and were overcome with attention after the victory. They go on to record, in amusingly bad style, songs about dogs. Sherri Ann and Christy have entered into a partnership and publish a magazine for lesbian dog owners called Modern Bitch. Harlan fulfills his dreams and becomes a ventriloquist, entertaining sparse crowds with a honky tonk song and dance number. Hamilton and Meg Swan have found a new dog, one that enjoys watching them make love, and are sure it will be a winner. Stefan and Scott are in the process of designing a calendar featuring Shih Tzu dogs appearing in scenes, with appropriate costume, from famous classic films, such as Gone with the Wind and Casablanca."

"Over an animated opening credits sequence, a New York City bookie named Johnny finds evidence of crimes that a high-powered businessman has committed. Johnny locks the incriminating photos and financial records crimes in a bank safe deposit box and gives the key to his girl friend, Nikki Finn (Madonna). When he tries to blackmail the person, the industrialist has Johnny killed, and the thugs stuff his body in the trunk of Nikki's car. Sometime later, Nikki is arrested for the murder.

As a condition of her parole she is to return to her hometown in Philadelphia for the remainder of her parole.The movie then introduces tax attorney Loudon Trott (Griffin Dunne) on a busy day. He is getting married to the daughter of one of the richest men in New York, Simon Worthington. Loudon's bride Wendy Worthington (Haviland Morris) is a selfish woman who is more consumed in her wedding plans than in the well-being of her fiance. Loudon, on the other hand, has a number of duties entrusted to him by his boss (and future father-in-law), Mr. Worthington (John McMartin).Simon Worthington calls Loudon into his office where he orders him to pick up Nikki upon her release, and make sure she gets on a bus for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Worthington does not explain Nikki's background, merely stating it is a charitable mission for the company known as: ""Operation Prisoner Shuttle."" En route to the prison, Loudon Trott stops at the docks to pick up a package for another client, millionaire Montgomery Bell (John Mills). Loudon is stunned to find the package is a full grown cougar, a rare, nearly extinct Patagonia felis concolor, which only mates every twenty-six months. With the cougar locked in a cage in the back seat of Simon Worthington's Rolls Royce convertible, Loudon picks up Nikki Finn from the prison. The young woman insists on stopping at a shopping mall to buy presents for her family before getting on the bus. Meanwhile police detectives Bellson and Doyle follow Nikki. They arranged for her early release in hope that she would lead them to the evidence Johnny had and the identity of the real murderer.At the shopping mall, Nikki now has a new wardrobe and steals some music cassette tapes from a local Sam Goody record store, and plants one on a leering guy who she sends out of the store which triggers the alarm, and allows Nikki to leave with the alarm blaring and the guy getting picked up by security for shoplifting.After leaving the shopping mall, Nikki refuses to leave town until she buys a gun in Harlem from a weapons dealer that a cellmate used to know. Loudon agrees to placate her, and lets Nikki drive the Rolls Royce. However, her reckless driving prompts police to pull her over, and causes Loudon to collapse. Police take Loudon to the hospital, believing he is having a heart attack. There, Nikki tells hospital authorities that she is Loudon's wife, and while he is unconscious, she takes his wallet and clothes, and flees in his automobile.When Loudon awakens, he takes a taxicab to Harlem, where he finds vandals spray painting graffiti on the Rolls Royce and stealing its parts. The cougar, which Nikki has named ""Murray,"" has escaped. Loudon finds Nikki buying a gun in a seedy apartment, as police raid the gun dealer's apartment. Nikki and Loudon escape via the roof and avoid arrest. After hiding in the closet of a next door apartment building, Nikki sets off the fire alarm and building sprinklers and she and Loudon escape again.Afterward, while hiding out in a trash dumpster, Nikki whistles, and Murray comes running to her. Here she confides (and flirts) with Loudon as she insists on clearing her name. Nikki still has the key to Johnny's bank deposit box, but does not know the the name of the bank or the box number. However, she tells him that the pimp Raoul (Coati Mundi) and his lackey Benny (Dennis Burkley), the people who killed Johnny, does know.Simon Worthington telephones Loudon on his car phone, demanding that he get Nikki on the bus. Loudon promises to carry out the assignment, even though he has come to despise the free-spirited woman.When Nikki and Loudon find Raoul, a fight ensues as Nikki, using her semi-automatic handgun, holds Raoul and Benny hostage while Loudon drives the limo they are in erratically leading to the top level of a parking garage, with the limo dangling on the edge of the building. Eventually, Raoul reveals the name of the bank in Manhattan and he and Nikki get away as the limo falls off the building and into the Hudson River.En route, Loudon stops at Cartier to pick up his wedding rings. As Nikki tries on a necklace, she takes off the chain with the safe deposit key on it. The store clerk notices that the clasp on her chain is broken, and as he tries to fix it, the key falls into a package. However, a delivery man named Buck (James Dietz) takes the package away before they can retrieve it. Nikki and Loudon follow the delivery truck, which coincidentally arrives at the apartment of Loudon's fiancee, Wendy Worthington.

Nikki convinces Raoul to let Wendy go and take her instead. Afterward, Nikki whistles for Murray, who scares Raoul and Benny, and Nikki flees with the cougar.That evening, Loudon goes to millionaire Montgomery Bell's townhouse to report that he has lost Murray, but he is surprised to find Nikki and the cougar already there.

"Being the son of Christian missionaries, Ezekial Cobb has lived in a small isolated town in China for twenty years, since he was an adolescent. Because of this sheltered life, Ezekial, who follows the teaching of Chinese poet and philosopher Ling Po, is a naive and overly trusting man.

Although Ezekial accepts the nomination on the premise he will lose as his primary goal is to find that wife and return to China, Ezekial, a man with integrity, may have different goals once he learns how corrupt politics in Stockport truly is.

"Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) is a well-liked English literature teacher, living a quiet life in Greenleaf, Indiana, with his fiancée and fellow teacher Emily Montgomery (Joan Cusack). The town is filled with anticipation over the nomination of Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon), Brackett's former student, in the Best Actor category at the Academy Awards for his portrayal of a gay soldier in the war film 'To Serve and Protect'. Cameron does indeed win the Best Actor award, and in his acceptance speech, thanks Howard for his inspiration by adding: ""and he's gay!""Howard's parents (Debbie Reynolds and Wilford Brimley), his cousins (Gregory Jbara, Kate McGregor-Stewart, Alice Drummond, Selma Blair), and friends (Debra Monk, Ernie Sabella, Joseph Maher, William Duell), fellow students (Shawn Hatosy, Zak Orth, Lauren Ambrose, Alexandra Holden), plus co-workers (Lewis J. Stadlen, Deborah Rush, Kevin Chamberlin), and fiancée are naturally shocked, but that is nothing compared to Howard's own reaction of disbelief and indignation, and he angrily tries to reassure those who know him that he is a heterosexual. The very next day reporters from all over the country invade his hometown, harassing him for interviews following the awards night telecast, and Howard is placed under the scrutiny of his boss, Principal Halliwell (Bob Newhart), who is uncomfortable with the attention being brought to the school.Although the other reporters leave over the next few days after getting their story when Howard tells them that he is not gay and the whole thing with Cameron's speach is a simple misunderstanding, one reporter stays behind. He is the openly gay Peter Malloy (Tom Selleck), who wants to wait the week out so he can cover Howard's wedding to Emily. Howard continues to be harassed and dismayed by the changed attitudes of everyone around him, and decides that he must sleep with Emily in order to prove his heterosexuality. Howard tries, but cannot go through with it all the way due to his conflicting emotions and Emily's concern for his well-being.Howard crosses paths with Peter, who tries to provide a helpful ear and narrates his own experience in coming out to his family. Peter thinks that Howard is in denial of his sexual orientation and wants him to be honest with not only himself, but everyone. Howard still insists that he is not gay, prompting Peter to kiss him. Although shocked, Howard reacts somewhat positively to the kiss, vindicating Peter's instinct all along on the matter. Peter tells Howard that if he still wants to get married (to a woman) Peter will not stop him, but he also tells Howard that he is hiding the true fact of who he is.Howard's final measure to restore his heterosexuality is the use of a self-help audio cassette, although that fails as well. During the wedding ceremony, Emily recites her vow without hesitation, but when Howard is prompted by the minister, he instead says, ""I'm gay."" The wedding is off, and although Peter is proud of Howard, Howard is angry with himself for hurting Emily. Things take a turn for the worse when he is fired from the school because of his outing.Despite being fired, Howard attends the graduation ceremony to support his students. When one student (Shawn Hatosy) who got into college with Howard's hard work, learns that he was dismissed for being gay, he and his classmates proclaim themselves, one by one, to be gay as well, to show their support of Howard and to thumb their noses at the school board. Howard's family follows suit, as do his friends, and all the townsfolk assembled.Having learned of the ensuing media blitz while in Los Angeles, Cameron Drake flies to his hometown, with his supermodel girlfriend (Shalom Harlow), to support his former teacher and although Howard doesn't win 'Teacher Of The Year', Cameron presents him with his Oscar as a gift.The film ends with Howard's wedding-crazy mother finally getting a wedding - her own, when she and her husband decide to renew their vows.

Cameron's high school English teacher Howard Brackett is overjoyed when Cameron wins the award and mentions Howard's contribution in his acting life. That joy turns to horror when Cameron mentions to the worldwide audience that Howard is gay, especially horrific to Howard as he is engaged to fellow teacher Emily Montgomery, a woman with self-esteem issues as she had battled weight issues most of her life before she lost seventy-five pounds for the wedding. Howard's life is totally disrupted as Hollywood media descends on Greenleaf in order to get Howard's story. The rest of Greenleaf also openly wonders if Howard is indeed gay, as he exhibits many stereotypical gay tendencies, such as being neat, and loving music, dancing, poetry and Barbra Streisand. His cause is not helped in that his and Emily's relationship has not yet been consummated. The one person not concerned is Emily, who trusts Howard. As Howard continues to deny being gay to his family, friends and colleagues, he begins to examine himself hypercritically if only because if others believe he's gay, there may be some merit to the claim, as well as because of an incident that occurs with Hollywood reporter Peter Malloy, who is doing a week-long piece on Howard leading up to his and Emily's wedding.

Whilst digging the grave he stumbles across another buried corpse. Tommy reports Jean missing to the police and tries to get on with his life. While Tommy and Noel are bingeing on liquor shots to aid in their denial of the terrible truth, they run into Jean's winsome friend Viv, a university phycology student. They somewhat mask their mutual attraction, but ultimately agree to see each other the following day. Meanwhile, a sniffing dog leads his master to the two buried corpses. Detective Inspector Wheeler informs Tommy that Jean's body has been found, along with an unidentified corpse that was several years old. Tommy keeps his cool and acts like an innocent person. Subsequently, Wheeler identifies to Tommy the other body was the wife of very prominent local politician Gordon Ellis who happened to be in the midst of an election. Following the funeral service for Jean, Tommy and Viv return to his flat, whereupon Detective Inspector barges in and announces that an anonymous caller has informed him of evidence at the apartment. The police go directly to a very obscure hiding place in the flat and find that someone has planted a photograph of Kathleen Ellis, who Tommy has already denied knowing. Tommy is once again questioned at the police station, but doesn't admit to either murder. As he is preparing to leave the station, Gordon Ellis is arriving to meet with Detective Inspector Wheeler. Ellis threatens Tommy that he will be convicted of both murders and will spend his life in jail. Feeling he has no other choice, Tommy enlists a very reluctant Noel to helped him murder Ellis, and stage the scene to look like a suicide by overdose and hanging. While carrying out this plan, they are interrupted by Wheeler paying a visit to Ellis and finding him with a noose around his neck but clinging to life. Tommy and Noel take cover, and overhear a conversation between Ellis and Wheeler, where they hear that Ellis has always been the prime suspect in his wife's murder, but Wheeler was unable to make a case against him. Ellis pleads for help, but Wheeler tells him it's not coming and then finishes off the murder. Wheeler hears Tommy and Noel escape, but doesn't see them. However, he finds a cigarette lighter at the crime scene, which he recognizes as belonging to Tommy. Noel is repulsed by what he has witnessed and wants to report the dirty cop, but Tommy reminds him he is in too deep and had better keep quite. Nevertheless, their friendship is seriously strained. Tommy telephones Viv for a date, dropping all pretext of a ""just friends"" relationship. With Tommy and Viv in his flat, soaking wet after getting drenched in the rain, both Noel and Wheeler at some point also drop by, to, respectively, attempt to repair their friendship and confront Tommy about the lighter found at the murder scene. Lots happens here: Tommy finds that Viv knows a lot more about Jean's death than she has let on, and there is another accidental murder, with the witnesses once again agreeing to hide the body rather than face potentially being jailed for a crime."

With the scare, all the convenience store items which the old man has bought, fall to the ground. A pretty female teenager offers to help the old man, but he scares her away with a torrent of insults; when he is left alone, the old man laughs threateningly, saying that all the damn children will be sorry, and he picks up first a red apple and then some Gillette razor blades.The girl, Judy (Cathy Podewell) arrives home in anger and slams the door. She asks her mother (Karen Ericson) whether Jay (Lance Fenton) has called her, and her mother says he didn't. Sal (William ""Billy"" Gallo) has been the one who called, but Judy is not interested in him. When Jay finally does call, he tells her that her efforts to get money for the poor are useless and that they have changed their plans to enjoy the night, so that they will go to Angela (Amelia ""Mimi"" Kinkade)'s party instead. Judy dislikes Angela, but she finally changes herself and decides to go. Jay tells her that they will go to Hull House. While she is undressing, Judy's little brother Billy (Donnie Jeffcoat Jr.) scares her with a monster's mask, jumping from inside her closet. He mocks her boobs, and goes to unlock the door: somebody has rung the bell. When he opens it up, nobody is there. A side door opens, and it's Sal who scares the boy. He tells the boy to call Judy, but he tells the news: Judy is going out with Jay. Sal leaves for Hull House with the boy's monster mask.Meanwhile, Angela steals a sackful of things from the local convenience store while her friend, sexy bombshell Suzanne (Linnea Quigley) distracts the male shop clerks (James W.

Max mentions that there is a river underground, and that the high wall was built to keep evil spirits away, as they can't cross water. He also points that nothing can be heard, not even crickets. Somebody is watching them from behind the window.Jay wants to hide inside a coffin to scare the stranded friends, who have just arrived; when he opens the lid, Sal is inside wearing Billy's monster mask, scaring Jay. The party begins right away. When the batteries of the radio become dead, Angela proposes to celebrate a seance. They push Rodger and Stooge into another room, and they find a huge mirror. Rodger looks dizzy about that. Rodger is the only one who doesn't sit in front of the mirror. When they all - except Rodger - concentrate, the mirror's image fades to black. Helen sees the head of a monster, and also the severed head of a man who looks like a pirate pushed against the mirror. Helen panics and starts whimpering, while the mirror falls to the ground. They all look to the pieces of broken window glass, and some knocks are heard. Nobody has invited anybody else, but Suzanne (Linnea Quigley) wishes that a good-looking stud appears.

That gives them the opportunity to run and leave the vault.However, when they are about to pry open the door, Jay appears, threatening Judy especially. Angela and Jay join sides, and move menacingly towards them. Rodger jumps through a window; Judy follows through. As there is no door in the wall, they have to climb it. For Judy, it's a difficult task, so Rodger goes first and then tries to pull her above the wall. He finally has to let go of her, when all the dead people appear.

The old man picks up his newspaper and goes back in his home. There, his wife (Marie Denn) has already prepared him his breakfast. He grumbles that there's nothing nice about the day, and that the food is not bad.They talk, and the wife says that she's been awake for hours, so that she decided to make some home-made apple pie as he bought so many. At that moment, the old man stops eating. He feels something strange: his neck is cut open from the inside, and one of the razor blades slides outside among a spring of blood. The old man dies a painful death. His wife / widow approaches him and kisses him on his head tenderly, wishing him a happy Halloween and it cuts to the credits.

"On Halloween night, a group of 10 teenagers led by Angela (Mimi Kinkade) and Suzanne (Linnea Quigley) decide to have a party at Hull House, an abandoned funeral home. The house was the scene of a horrifying murder-suicide committed by the owner's son some years before, and had spawned legends of 'the boogeyman' among local children, who avoid it. It is also rumored to have been built on unholy ground, according to local Indian tribes, and a high wall was erected over an underground stream on the property to keep the evil spirits confined, as they cannot cross water. The teens soon start engaging in a party inside the house, with dancing and alcohol. But it isn't until Angela conducts a seance that trouble starts brewing. The face of a demon appears in the mirror and vanishes quickly, but not before one of the girls sees it. In the mansion's depths, the demon seen in the mirror pushes open a heavy steel door and closes in on the teens. The demon takes control of Suzanne first, and then, one at a time, the other teens become possessed or are murdered savagely, only to come back to life as demons. Eventually, only 2 of the teens - Judy (Cathy Podewell) and Rodger (Alvin Alexis) - are left alive. Will they escape the 'Night of the Demons', or fall prey to the horrifying demons that their friends have become?::Derek O'Cain"

"Cartoonist ""Hoops"" McCann (John Cusack) works on a scholarship application to the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD), before rushing off to attend his high school graduation ceremony. Hoops comes from a long-line of professional basketball players (his father and grandfather, great-grandfather, etc.) but was rejected for a sports scholarship to his college of choice due to his poor basketball performance on the school team of not scoring a single hoop. Hoops can't even throw a paper wad into a wastebasket from three feet away (a running gag used throughout the movie). At school, Hoops joins his best friend, George Calamari (Joel Murray), who persuades Hoops to spend two weeks partying on Nantucket Island. George stops to pick up his 10-year-old sister, Squid (Kristen Goelz), after school. She and her injured dog, Bosco, join George and Hoops for the trip to Nantucket after Squid shows that she does not tolerate any verbal abuse from others over her dog's ugly appearance. When two young girls make fun of Bosco and contort their faces, Squid slaps them on their backs and their faces stay that way. They both run off screaming.They stop for gas, and Hoops uses the restroom. A group of bikers led by Stain (John Matuszak) check the stalls looking for a woman named Cassandra (Demi Moore). As Stain demands his money, Hoops finds Cassandra's cash hidden in the towel dispenser, and throws the bills up in the air. He runs out, grabs Cassandra, and they jump into George's car. George speeds to the ferry, which is leaving the dock. George's car lands on the ferry deck, while the lead biker, Stain, falls into the bay (and getting little fish harpooned to his spiked pink-colored hairstyle).During the ferry ride, Cassandra informs them that she is visiting her grandfather, Mr. Eldridge, who lives on the island. When they arrive, she suggests they might meet again. George introduces Hoops to his friends, fraternal Stork twins Clay (Tom Villard) and Egg (Bobcat Goldthwait), who are working as private security guards on a Hollywood film set filming a movie titled 'Foam 2' a horror film about a dolphin with rabies attacking people. The group arrives at the home of George's grandparents. Grandma (Billie Bird) fusses over Squid while George's insane Uncle Frank (Bruce Wagner) listens obsessively to the local radio station, trying to win an on-air contest. The crotchety man tells his nephew and Hoops to scram.George and Hoops go to Target Beach and meet another friend, Ack Ack ""Acky"" Raymond (Curtis Armstrong), who collects mortar shells for his father, General Raymond (Joe Flaherty), the owner of the local guns and ammunition store. As they drive past a cemetery, Hoops notices Cassandra at her grandfather's funeral.Meanwhile, at the estate of the island's richest and most powerful family, the Beckersteds, Aguilla Beckersted (Mark Metcalf) asks his spoiled son, Teddy (Matt Mulhern), if he is prepared to win this year's sailing regatta. Teddy has a new sailboat but the stakes are high. Old Man Beckersted (William Hickey), Teddy's wealthy grandfather, has vowed to disown Aguilla and Teddy, if the young man does not win the trophy. Aguilla wants to use his father's resources to purchase the late Mr. Eldridge's property and build condominiums. However, his plan will be foiled if Cassandra raises $3,000 to pay Eldridge's back taxes.As Hoops walks with Cassandra on the beach, she explains her financial predicament. In addition, she worries that the friends her grandfather invited to live at the house will soon be homeless. Cassandra decides to sell some of her grandfather's furniture to raise money. Hoops draws cartoons to cheer her up (showing one of several animated sequences throughout the film of a ""Lonely Rhino"" searching for ""Love"" a blind cupid, while evading the evil and wealthy ""Funny Bunnies"").Meanwhile, Uncle Frank is determined to phone in to the radio contest. He takes the phone and radio into the bathroom but slips on a bar of soap and shocks himself.On the beach, Hoops works at his drawings until George suggests that the Stork twins entertain his friend. As they chat, Teddy's girl friend, Cookie Cambell (Kimberly Foster), asks Hoops, Clay, and Egg to help her launch her boyfriend's sailboat. Hoops declines Cookie's offer to go sailing but agrees to go to the movies. Later, Hoops learns that Cassandra has raised some money selling her grandfather's furniture. Cassandra invites him to the Dew Drop Inn to hear her play guitar, where she hopes to raise more money. Hoops promises to be there, but has already made the movie date with Cookie. He tells his friends that he prefers to watch Cassandra perform, but Cookie shows up at the door, and he feels obligated to go to the movies with her. He asks the Storks to keep an eye on Teddy at his family's house in case he leaves to look for Cookie. Egg takes over for his brother, watching the costume trailer and gets himself stuck in a Godzilla costume. When he realizes he has to be at the Beckerstead's party to watch Teddy, he is forced to go in the costume.Back at the drive in, Cookie is bored, and suggests that they go to ""the Point"" and look at the moon.Elsewhere, Grandma takes Squid on a drive into town for dinner. While at a gas station, the two attendants make fun of Squid's dog, which leads to Squid to roll up her car window to trap their neckties and Grandma drags them down the road.At the Beckersted estate, Egg (still stuck in his Godzilla costume) hides in the bushes where a fundraiser is being held to raise money for the condo developments on the Elderidge property, and some Japanese investors are in attendance. At the drive-in theater, Hoops buys snacks, and Teddy's friend, Ty (Jeremy Piven), notices that Hoops is with Cookie. Ty telephones his friend and reports that Cookie is on a date with Hoops. The news sends Teddy into a jealous rage.When Old Man Beckersted throws a lit cigar which lands in Egg's Godzilla's mouth, he goes crazy and crashes the party with smoke billowing out of his Godzilla mouth and stomps on the condo development models (resembling a Japanese monster movie of Godzilla stomping on city buildings) before running away into the night.At the Point, General Raymond delivers a rousing speech to his Boy Scout troop about how their overnight retreat is a perfect opportunity to practice their rescue skills. Just then, Hoops slips and falls, and the scouts descend and wrap him in bandages like a mummy. The scouts chase after Cookie, but she runs away and Teddy picks her up in his car. George rescues Hoops, and they drive to the Dew Drop Inn, but it is closed. Egg also arrives still dressed in his Godzilla costume as well as Acky and Clay, and they all help Egg out of the costume. When Teddy arrives with his friends and threatens to beat up Hoops, Cassandra steps in and challenges Teddy to compete against Hoops in a series of free-throw basketball shots (unaware that Hoops is terrible at basketball). While Teddy makes every shot, Hoops misses all the baskets. Teddy is eager to rough up Hoops, but Cassandra sprays mace so that her new friends can escape. Hoops thanks her, and apologizes for missing her performance.A few days later, Hoops sees Cassandra at the beach, and offers to use his animation skills to help her fund raise. He creates an animated advertisement for Cassandra's performance, and shows it at the drive-in. He and his friends also hand out concert fliers in town. When Aguilla Beckersted realizes that Cassandra might raise enough money to save her grandfather's property, he enlists Teddy to prevent her from performing. Hoops and his friends fight back by pouring barrels of live lobsters into the Beckersted swimming pool. When Teddy goes for a swim, the lobsters attack him and Cookie.Cassandra's concert is a success, but when she shows up to pay the tax bill, the banker explains that he already sold the mortgage to Old Man Beckersted. In revenge, Aguilla reveals more of his ruthlessness when he kicks and severely injures Squid's dog, who has to go to the animal hospital (staffed mostly by animals).Cassandra is ready to give up, but Acky Raymond suggests they enter and win the regatta by beating Teddy. The friends work to repair a shoddy boat, and Cassandra persuades Hoops to be captain. As they finish the boat, they realize they don't have a very powerful engine. Clay shows up with Teddy's Ferrari to have it serviced. Egg notices that Clay has a black eye given to him by Teddy. Egg becomes enraged, grabs a chainsaw and approaches Teddy's Ferrari.Race day arrives and most people laugh at Hoops' team and their boat, which looks silly next to the higher end sloops. The race begins with each team rowing out of the harbor. When they start to fall behind, George eggs Egg on with negative news about his favorite wrestling star and they begin to make up some distance. Teddy's team pulls way out in front. After a few miles, Aguilla Beckersted appears aboard Teddy's boat sabotages Hoops' team by cutting their lanyard line with an arrow from a cross bow. Unable to thread the rope at the top of the mast, Hoops uses a small weight, and on a million-to-one shot, throws the small bearer ball through the hoop at the top. As Hoops, George, Acky, Clay and Egg sail on, Aguilla aims another arrow to put a hole in Hoops' craft, when the mechanical dolphin from Foam 2, powered by Squid, rams his boat and Aguilla overboard and ""eats"" him alive.In the last lap, the racers retract the sails and engage the boats' engines. Teddy leaves his father in the water and speeds toward the finish. Hoops' team all don anti-aircraft helmets and blow the boat's ""hatch"", revealing the engine from Teddy's Ferarri, installed by the Stork twins after Egg's rampage. Hoops and his friends speed to victory (giving 'the finger' to Teddy, Ty and the rest of his snobby friends). Afterward, Hoops offers Teddy the trophy in exchange for the Eldridge house. However, Old Man Beckersted, impressed with the novice team's effort, informs Cassandra that he is returning the Eldridge property to her. There will be no real estate development. Hoops and Cassandra celebrate and kiss. Also, Squid's dog is alive and returns to her... after giving birth a litter of puppies at the animal hospital.In the final scene, George's uncle Frank finally wins, but his phone gets disconnected and his prize is given away to someone else; he snaps and promptly uses a rocket launcher to blow up the radio station. The Stork twins arrive and head to the fiery remains to roast marshmallows."

"Kate Hartounian (Jessica Lundy) is the teenage daughter of a wealthy and widowed real estate developer of Armenian and Jewish descent. Eager to improve her lot in life, she makes friends with Miffy Young (Chynna Phillips), a snooty WASP girl, who encourages her and her father to join their country club.Kate and her father, Jack (Jackie Mason), apply for membership at Bushwood Country Club... club from the first movie. Jack is a self-made millionaire, yet remains self-effacing, friendly and generous despite his wealth. His crude personality foils him on many occasions. However, one member, a widow named Elizabeth Pearce (Dyan Cannon), shows a liking to him.When the current members meet Jack, who builds low-income housing in more upscale neighborhoods, his application to join is rejected. The rejection is borne out of his oafish personality and an earlier confrontation with Bushwood's snobbish president (and Miffy's father) Chandler Young's (Robert Stack) wife. Cynthia Young (Dina Merrill) had tried unsuccessfully to persuade Jack to build his housing complex away from her neighborhood, but her less-than-subtle snobbery leads Jack to chase Cynthia with a bulldozer. It's actions like these that build a divide between Jack and Kate.Meanwhile, Ty Webb (Chevy Chase) returns, this time as the club's majority share owner, and while he admires Jack, he prefers to stay out of the way Jack's business and of the club's day-to-day operations.The elitist members of Bushwood reject Jack's membership application and pull strings to suspend his housing operation. In retaliation, Jack buys the majority stock to Bushwood from Ty and turns it into an amusement park. Chandler, incensed at the thought of a mere ""nouveau-riche"" individual getting the better of him, hires Captain Tom Everett (Dan Aykroyd) (who code-names Chandler Mrs. Esterhaus), a shell-shocked mercenary operating out of a lunch wagon, to ""discourage"" Jack from building any more structures on Bushwood property. The bumbling Everett decides to use explosive golf balls to do this.Meanwhile, Chandler uses his lawyers and connections to shut down Jack's housing construction site. Webb suggests that the dispute should be resolved like gentlemen, by facing each other in a golf match. If Chandler wins, Jack loses his construction site and the country club, and if Jack wins, he keeps the Bushwood and the housing project.At the climatic golf match, despite Jack's poor performance early in the match, with luck he ties the match before the final hole. However, during the hole, Jack is faced with a 50-foot putt, while Chandler faces a simple 2 foot putt. Using advice given to him by Webb before the match, Jack manages to use spiritual chanting and the adage ""be the ball"" to sink the nearly impossible putt. Chandler needs to sink the easy 2 foot putt to tie the match. Meanwhile, Everett, who foolishly shoots himself in the buttocks with a poison dart, fails to eliminate Jack as a gopher (the same mischievous gopher from the first film) steals his explosive ball. The mischievous gopher replaces Chandler's ball with the explosive ball, and as his family encouragingly crowds around him as he taps in his final swing, the ball bursts and Jack wins the match.Though Kate is embarrassed by her father's actions, she is still loyal to him, as evidenced when she commiserates to Miffy, who suggests that she change her last name from Hartounian to Hart. Bewildered at the thought of turning her back on her family name, Kate turns her back on Miffy and makes up with her father. Also, Jack finally asks Elizabeth out on a date, and she accepts."

Buck assures Chanice that he will be at work in the morning; however, that night the Russells receive a phone call informing them that Cindy's father has suffered a heart attack. Bob and Cindy make arrangements to head to Indianapolis while also attempting to find a suitable babysitter for the kids. Only after every friend and neighbor proves unavailable, Cindy reluctantly agrees to allow Uncle Buck to watch the children.Bob phones Buck to offer him the job and Buck agrees because it will get him out of working for Chanice, and when he reaches his brother's house in his dirty, dented and smoking car, he assures Cindy that he will take great care of the kids. With a sitter in place, Bob and Cindy head to the airport as Buck settles in.The next morning, while Miles and Maizy take a liking to their uncle and his frank, fun-loving demeanor, Tia greets him with cold silence and is embarrassed when Buck drops her off at school, their arrival announced by his car's deafening backfire.

When the children divulge that she has left for a weekend ""jumbo party"" with Bug, Buck realizes he has no one to babysit while he goes to the track. After agonizing about taking the kids with him, Buck decides he cannot put them in that position. Instead he calls Chanice and asks her to put her feelings aside and watch the children while he looks for Tia.That evening, Buck combs the neighborhood until he finds the house where the party takes place and crashes the gathering. Breaking into an upstairs bedroom with a drill, Buck discovers Bug on a bed with a girl other than Tia. Soon after, while driving the streets, Buck finds Tia walking home. When she realizes Buck knows what occurred, the two have a heart-to-heart talk and Buck reveals that he has Bug in the trunk of his car.

Buck and Chanice make up, and the next morning Bob and Cindy return home to a repentant Tia and an uncle who departs as a valued member of the family."

Vikram wanted to kill his real wife Nisha (Gurleen Chopra) to get her wealth. When Aditi found out about his ways, she tried to stop him and failed. She later tried to reach Bunty at the show to tell him about it, but Vikram caught her. Then Mehra arrived at the play and killed Vikram.

Gandhi mistakes Ravinder as Sherkhan, a drug dealer from whom he used to buy drugs, ending up in annoying Ravinder. Meanwhile, Gulab Singh's employer (who had leased him a taxi) and Hakka, with his friends, enter the scene.

Gandhi, again due to incorrect briefing, fires at Mehra, but misses and the bullets pierce a beehive. The honeybees launch an attack, in standing against which everyone loses its head.

All cling to the front of the clock while a firefighting crane arrives. The firefighter allows only two people, but everybody holds the crane, overloading and throwing it out of order. The victims are thrown off the crane seconds after they hold it. The first is an Arab(possibly Sherkhan in disguise); he runs head and feet first into a Time Magazine poster. A British drug dealer (who works for Gandhi) then crashes into a window of a nearby building. Bunty and Aditi then land on a hanging poster. Aditi is saved but Bunty falls down. Ravinder lands into the reservoir of a fountain, ingesting a marine animal on reaching underwater. Gulab Singh's employer, Hakka and Guru fall on a palm tree.

His man falls into white paint. Gandhi emerges out tied to a rocket amidst deafening explosions. He, too, has a dive in the reservoir of a fountain. Champak slides down, ruining a set table. He is taken along by an oncoming Babla into a trashcan. The last to be thrown off the crane is Gulab Singh, who rests on the hands of a statue. The crane then falls apart. When in the hospital, Mehra returns the passports of Babla, Bunty and Champak. Then, he surrenders to his juniors."

"Newly elected to Congress, former local TV newsman Evan Baxter (Steve Carell) leaves Buffalo and shepherds his family to suburban northern Virginia, where his congressional campaign declares that he will change the world without explaining how he will do so.On his first job, he meets Marty (John Michael Higgins), Rita Daniels (Wanda Sykes) and top congressman Chuck Long (John Goodman). Soon after his arrival, strange things start to happen:01 - Animals follow Evan without any apparent reason. 02 - He grows a beard that is restored wholly every time he shaves. 03 - Eight vacant lots in Evan's neighborhood are purchased in his name. 04 - Ancient tools and wood are sent to his house. 05 - The number ""614"" appears everywhere he goes. Evan soon learns that the number indicates a verse in the book of Genesis, in which God instructs Noah to build an ark. Later, God (Morgan Freeman) appears and commands Evan to build a replica of Noah's Ark in preparation for a deluge. His family initially believe that he is having an extraordinary mid-life crisis; later, his sons suspect that something greater is occurring and assist him in the construction of the ark, although his wife Joan (Lauren Graham) does not. Reappearing, God tells Evan the flood will come at noon on September 22.
Animals later follow Evan to Congress. When he explains the reason for this, Chuck Long suspends him. Upon Evan's departure, some birds poop on Chuck. Joan, upon seeing a news report that features the Ark, takes their three sons to her mother's house, thinking to abandon Evan. Evan then builds the Ark alone, gaining international notice. Some time after Joan leaves Evan, God appears to her as a waiter at a diner, wearing a name tag displaying ""Al Mighty"" (a play on ""almighty""). In this guise, He tells her that God does not give things, but only the opportunity by which to obtain things, citing togetherness of families as one of these things. Seeing His meaning, Joan returns to Evan to finish the ark together. Meanwhile, word reaches Evan that Chuck Long has commissioned a dam and has cut corners in doing so.On September 22, Evan loads hundreds of animals onto the newly finished ark in front of live news crews and nearby citizens. Minutes pass wherein is no sign of rain, provoking the spectators' scorn. When a rainstorm is briefly present, Evan takes this as a sign of the coming deluge, but is proven wrong. Joan tells Evan to leave the ark; Evan, however, remembers Congressman Long's dam, which he fears may burst. As he thinks on this, the dam does burst, flooding the streets. At this, all spectators and policeman board the ark, which sails down the streets of Washington D.C. on the floodwaters of the lake until it eventually lands touching the front of the Capitol. Evan then tells Long that the flood was caused by his poor design of the dam, which incites the other congressmen present to turn against Long.As investigations on Chuck Long are occurring, Evan and his family later go on a hiking trip, during which God reappears to Evan, telling him that the way to change the world is by doing one Act of Random Kindness (""ARK"") at a time."

Sexual revelations emerge when a group of academics and their partners spend a weekend at a country retreat.::Shannon Patrick Sullivan <shannon@mun.ca>
"A group of academics at the University of Montreal - most long time friends - are planning on gathering at the lakeside recreational home of Rémy and Louise, who have been together for twenty years, married for fifteen of them, for dinner. Louise knows Rémy cheats on her, but believes he only does so when she is not around, about which she accepts. Their recreational home is adjacent to many of the recreational homes of the others, who are: divorced Pierre, his much younger current girlfriend Danielle who is a student at the university, the two who are still in the stage of newfound love, divorced mother Diane, independent minded Dominique, single homosexual Claude, and graduate student Alain. While the four men prepare the dinner, the four women are working out together in the gym. The common factor between the two groups is the topic of conversation: sex, especially as it relates to themselves. But underlying each of the conversations is their own academic and thus intellectual backgrounds, which shapes the nature of the discussions. When the two groups finally converge for dinner, a ninth person is added peripherally, brusque working class Mario, Diane's current sexual partner. This relationship is a first for Diane in that not only their sexual encounters but the way they interact with each other in general is predicated on S and M, dictated largely by Diane who nonetheless is the submissive. What happens with the group as dinner goes into evening and evening goes into morning is further shaped by them listening to a prerecorded interview Dominique did for CBC Radio earlier in the day to promote her new book, which discusses how the quest for individual happiness in modern western society is leading to the decline of the society in general.::Huggo"
"Four very different Montreal university teachers gather at a rambling country house to prepare a dinner. Remy (married), Claude (a homosexual), Pierre (involved with a girlfriend) and Alain (a bachelor) discuss sex, the female body and their affairs with them. Meanwhile, their four female guests, Louise (Remy's wife of 15 years), Dominique (a spinster), Diane (a divorcée) and Danielle (Pierre's girlfriend) are spending the time at a downtown health gym. They also discuss sex, the female body and, naturally, men. Later in the evening, they finally meet at the country house and have dinner. The discussion? Well, you can guess it... However, a ninth guest, named Mario, who used to know Diane, drops in on the group for some talk and has a surprise of his own.::Mattias Thuresson"

"Thinly veiled retro-modern version of Shakespeare's MACBETH. It takes place at a burger diner, in a small Pennsylvania town. Complete with fore-shadowing soothsayers, weirdly campy acting and pace, even a nineteen-seventies' self-awareness cornucopia. A black-comedy of errors, some trailer park trash, kill their boss and steal not only his money but also his idea to have a drive-thru window installed. After they get the money, they then buy the 'doomed' restaurant, from the owner's sons that don't really want any part of it.
A nosy vegetarian sheriff, then begins hanging around...as first a homeless man, whom the couple had framed, can't be pinned with the crime, and the older brother is suspected. The couple squirms as the damning evidence stacks up against the older son who had a 'sucky' relationship with his father, and no alibi."

"Joe McBeth is a hard-working but unambitious doofus who toils at a hamburger stand alongside his wife Pat, who has a significant edge in the brains department. Pat is convinced she could do a lot better with the place than their boss Norm Duncan is doing, so she works up a plan to usurp Norm, convincing Mac to rob the restaurant's safe and then murder Norm, using the robbery as a way of throwing the police off their trail. Though two stoners and a would-be fortune teller warn Mac that bad luck awaits him, he gathers his courage and goes through with his wife's scheme. At first, things seem to have gone just as Pat hoped, and after Norm's sons sell the restaurant to the McBeths (they pay for it with the money they stole from Norm), business takes off. But vegetarian police detective McDuff is convinced there's foul play at the new center of the fast food universe, and when the McBeths fear that fry cook Banco knows more than he's letting on, Mac takes charge in the plotting department and decides there may be more dead meat on the menu.::Anonymous"

"An American named Phoebe (Sean Young) arrives in Rome, Italy, after her Italian boyfriend, Marcello, invited her to move there with him. However, when she arrives, he refuses to take her telephone calls. Heartbroken, Phoebe wanders the streets of Rome, where a dachshund, wearing an expensive plaid coat, snatches her lunch. She shoos the dog away, but soon after, sees a newspaper advertisement offering a $5,000 reward for the lost dachshund's return to its wealthy owner, Madame Van Dougen, who lives in Monte Carlo, Monaco. Nearby, another American, Julian Peters (Richard Lewis), is fired by his Italian acting agent. When the lost dog begs him for food, he notes its expensive collar and sees ""Monte Carlo"" written on its name tag. Phoebe sees him with the dog and pretends it belongs to her; however, Julian does not believe her, and guesses that she is after a reward. She reluctantly agrees to split the money with him, and they travel to Monte Carlo by train.Elsewhere on the train, American couple Neil and Marilyn Schwary (James Belushi and Cybill Shepherd) discus Neil's system for winning at roulette. American passenger Augie Morosco (John Candy) interjects that there is no way to win at a casino, and admits that he is a recovering gambling addict, traveling to join his wealthy wife, Elena, in Monte Carlo. Soon after, Phoebe sees Augie Morosco holding the dachshund, and accuses him of stealing it. However, Augie tells her he bought the dog from a man in the dining car. Phoebe is furious, and searches for Julian, who tells her that Augie paid him $6,000 for the animal. Phoebe insists they return the money, and deliver the dog as promised. Augie refuses to return the pet until a train porter demands to see its traveling papers. Augie returns the dog to Julian, asking him to find him in Monte Carlo if he changes his mind about selling, and handing him a matchbook with his name on it. Julian and Phoebe are forced to exit the train and have the dog inspected by a veterinarian. When Julian telephones Madam Van Dougen to tell her they will be delayed, he hears an unexplained disruption on the other end of the line.Meanwhile, Marilyn and Neil arrive in Monaco, and she begs him not to gamble away all of their vacation money at the hotel casino. However, Neil ignores her and cashes in every cent on gambling chips. Marilyn dons an expensive gown from Neil's wholesale clothing business, before joining him in the casino. When she enters, she catches the eye of a dashing Italian man named Alfonso de la Pena (George Hamilton), but when Neil sees her, he calls her a ""jinx"" and sends her away from him. Marilyn meets Greek gambler Hercules Popodopoulos (Joss Ackland) who asks her to pick a number for him at the craps table. After winning, Hercules shares the profits with her and teaches her how to place bets. Before long, Marilyn wins a half-million dollars.Elsewhere, Neil loses all of his money. When he sees Augie Morosco winning at several tables at once, Neil begs for his help. They place a bet together, as Augie's beautiful wife, Elena (Ornella Muti), arrives, and chastises him for giving in to his addiction. Augie ignores her, and he and Neil win a large sum of money.Arriving in Monte Carlo, Phoebe is still angry with Julian for attempting to sell the dog behind her back. Despite the late hour, they go directly to Madame Van Dougen's villa, as instructed, but find the place empty. While wandering the grounds, they discover her body inside a garage, and flee. Julian returns for Phoebe's suitcase, and sees a man hiding in the bushes. Phoebe insists they go to police, but Julian fears they will be arrested as suspects, and treated poorly because they are foreigners. When officers walk past them on the street, Julian kisses Phoebe to hide their faces, leaving her flustered.Soon after, they make an anonymous telephone call to police from a cafe. Police trace the call and soon arrive. After Julian and Phoebe overhear the cafe owner giving their description to police, Phoebe puts the dog on a bus to get rid of it, but realizes that she left her suitcase at Madame Van Dougen's villa. Julian refuses to return with her and they part ways.Meanwhile, Augie and Neil lose all their money at the casino. Distraught, Neil wanders the streets and prays to find a suitcase filled with money. Outside of Madame Van Dougen's villa, Neil's wish is granted when he sees a suitcase sitting next to a running vehicle. With no one in sight, he steals it, and returns to his hotel room, where he pleads with Marilyn to forgive him for losing their money. Marilyn says she put money aside, knowing he would lose it all, and chastises him for stealing the suitcase. When they look inside, they are shocked to find the body of an old woman (off-camera). Fearing they will be arrested as suspects, they pack their belongings and flee the hotel, planning to abandon the suitcase along the way.Phoebe arrives at Madame Van Dougen's villa to search for her suitcase, followed by Julian, who apologizes for leaving her. He goes inside to get her suitcase, where police lie in wait. Inspector Bonnard (Giancarlo Giannini) questions Julian, who is nervous and appears guilty. Phoebe hides among the crowd that has formed outside the gates, and overhears a witness tell police that he saw a man and woman with a dog enter the property, and identifies Julian as the man he saw. As Phoebe looks on, the dachshund returns home, and runs to her side. She hides the pet under her coat, while Julian is taken to jail.The next morning, Neil and Marilyn Schwary board a train, and check the suitcase onto a train headed for a different destination. However, as they celebrate their escape, the porter chases after them with the suitcase. Despite their protests, he pushes it through the window of their departing train car. They try once more to get rid of it, to no avail, and porters soon find the body after a routine check of passengers' luggage.Inspector Bonnard questions Madame Van Dougen's short housekeeper and butler, who claim they were out of the house all evening after learning the housekeeper's sister had been in an automobile accident. When Phoebe is found with the dog, she is arrested and brought to the station. The housekeeper and butler confirm that it is, in fact, Madame Van Dougen's dog, Napoleon. Bonnard questions Julian and Phoebe about Augie Morosco, whose name was written in a matchbook found next to Van Dougen's body. Julian realizes he must have dropped the matchbook, and struggles to explain how it got there. Bonnard declares that their accomplices have arrived, as Neil and Marilyn Schwary are brought into the station in handcuffs. However, Julian and Phoebe do not know Neil and Marilyn, and Bonnard tries to sort out the truth as everyone claims their innocence.Meanwhile, Augie buys flowers for Elena and vows to have given up gambling for good. She forgives him, and tells him the newspaper story about Van Dougen's murder. Back at the police station, Neil names Augie as his alibi on the night of the murder, and Bonnard calls Augie in for questioning. When Augie reveals that he met Van Dougen several weeks before at a casino, Bonnard believes he is guilty. Surprised to see all four of his American acquaintances from the train behind bars, Augie reluctantly admits to having met Julian and Phoebe on the train, but refuses to admit that he knows Neil and Marilyn, whom he suspects of being guilty. Augie claims he was with his wife at the time of the murder, and later asks Elena to be his alibi. She confesses that she was with another man at the time, in retaliation for Augie's gambling. When Italian playboy Alfonso de la Pena overhears their conversation at a restaurant, he flees, and Elena admits that Alfonso was her lover. Augie follows Alfonso, and convinces him to keep quiet about the events of that night.That evening, Bonnard arrives at the hotel to question Augie again, and reveals that a man was seen going out the fire escape of his wife's room. Augie claims to have been the man, and Bonnard asks him to reenact the events of the night, following Augie to the fire escape, and forcing him to walk across a beam to the other side of the street where he gained entrance into Van Dougen's villa. Augie and Bonnard enter Van Dougen's home where Bonnard has gathered the American suspects to try to get to the truth. They turn on each other as they each proclaim their innocence. However, Elena refuses to name Alfonso de la Pena as the man she was with, until Bonnard brings him into the room. Julian instantly recognizes Alfonso's shiny shoes and insists he was the man in the bushes at the crime scene. Alfonso confesses that he and Van Dougen, whom he calls ""Claire,"" were secret lovers, and insists she was not in her bedroom when he arrived for their regular rendezvous. He only hid in the bushes to protect Claire's privacy when he heard Julian and Phoebe arrive. Finally, Bonnard brings in the housekeeper and butler, and reveals several holes in their story, forcing the butler to confess that he and the housekeeper murdered Van Dougen due to her abusive and harsh treatment of them.The Americans celebrate their release over dinner, with Bonnard in attendance. Julian toasts to Napoleon for the dog's part in leading him to his new love, Phoebe, while Marilyn reveals her $500,000 winnings to Neil, and demands he start treating her with more respect. Later, Bonnard tells one of his detectives that Madame Van Dougen left her $20 million fortune to Napoleon, and realizes that whoever inherited the dog will actually receive the money.Elsewhere in the final scene, Alfonso de la Pena sips champagne on a yacht with Napoleon."

Here Jesse meets Tania, a ""gender challenged male"" who angrily tells him that she gave him a suitcase full of stolen money to keep safe for her and she wants it back.Jesse and Chester decide to go to The Twins house to try to remember the night before. They try to help The Twins clean the house but fail when they accidenly spill garbage all over the living room floor. Wilma and Wanda kick them out proclaiming they never to anything right.At this point the Jesse and Chester are kidnapped by a group of space nerds who follow Zoltan (Hal Sparks). The nerds tell them that last night they were in possession of a mysterious and powerful device called the Continuum Transfunctioner, and the nerds are searching for this device.Upon being dropped off back on Main Street, the guys visit the local tailor, Mr. Lee, who gives them their special suits that they ordered the night before.

At the same time, Tommy and his friends kidnap Nelson, and calls Jesse and Chester to arrange the transfer of Nelson for the Continuum Transfunctioner.After leaving the police station, Jesse and Chester meet a pair of gay-looking Nordic dudes who claim to be the Keepers of the Continuum Transfunctioner. They lent it to Jesse and Chester the night before. But the guys are more suspicious then ever and shake the two mysterious guys off. Our heroes go home to their house only to meet The Twins who break up with them. Overcome with love for The Twins, Jesse and Chester realize they must have really good anniversary gifts in the car and resume the search.Jesse and Chester arrive at a car impound lot where they are told that their car was sold at auction, but are able to get the address of the buyer. At this point they are once again approached by the Nordic dudes and they send them to Chinese Foooood to keep them busy with the non-English speaking Chinese lady over the order intercom.While they are on their way to the buyer's place, Jesse and Chester are kidnapped by the space nerds again and taken to their leader's country house, only to find out The Twins are bound and gagged and being held hostage by Zoltan until he receives the Continuum Transfunctioner.Jesse and Chester are allowed to leave and they follow the address of the man who purchased their car at auction to a very secure ostrich compound. They sneak over the fence in only to be attacked by several ostriches and are then captured and caged for poaching by the compound owner Pierre (Brent Spiner), an eccentric ostrich breeder. Jesse and Chester are freed when Chester knows the answer to the question Pierre poses thanks to his constant watching of Animal Planet. Pierre offers to give them their car back only to discover it has been stolen from the compound. All Pierre was able to recover was a locker key from a locker at Captain Stu's Space-O-Rama, a local minature golf course and video arcade.As nightfall arrives, Jesse and Chester arrive at the Space-O-Rama and find a stash of cool stuff in the locker, including Captain Stu tickets, a cool straw, and the suitcase full of money. Tania and her transsexual boyfriend, Patty, show up and take the money. Jesse and Chester use the Captain Stu tickets to buy a fake Continuum Transfunctioner. They then call Zoltan and Tommy claiming that they have the Continuum Transfunctioner. Zoltan shows up and trades The Twins for the fake Transfunctioner. Just then, Tommy shows up and steals the fake Transfunctioner and lets Nelson free. The five Hot Chicks and the two Nordic Dudes show up, both claming to be the Keepers of the Continuum Transfunctioner. Even Christy Boner shows up and has a quick meeting of the minds with Nelson, while Jesse and Chester's boss, also shows up with pizza after Chester annoymously called requesting pizza.Just then, Chester then solves the Rubiks Cube (which he has been working on the entire time since finding it in his colored suit) which suddenly glows and morphs into a strange silver-painted globe and it is revealed to be the Continuum Transfunctioner. The Transfunctioner is now activated and will destroy the universe unless the true Keepers can turn it off. Jesse and Chester decide who the real Keepers are by asking a question about the 18th hole of putt-putt the night before. Only the real Keepers know that they won a lifetime supply of pudding by getting a hole in one. The two alien Nordic dudes answer correctly and are given back the Transfunctioner which they deactivate it.The universe is saved until the Hot Chicks scream with rage and morph into a ""Super Hot Giant Alien Chick"" and go after the Continuum Transfunctioner. The Nordic Dudes attempt to use the device to bannish the giant to Hoboken, New Jersey, only to get flung aside, and the Transfunctioner lads in Jesse's hands. The Giant Alien Chick then eats Tommy, while Christy reacts with indifference. Jesse and Chester are forced to run outside in the putt-putt golf course and the Giant Chick follows them. Jesse and Chester must activate the Photon Accelerator Annihilation Beam to destroy her. Chester once again saves the day thanks to his love of Animal Planet by using a straw as a tool to push the button. Tommy however is still alive when he gets blown out of the giant alien chick's body.Christy falls in love with Nelson. The Nordic Dudes take the space nerds to a party in the Crab Nebula. Everyone's memory is erased by the Nordic Dudes as they use the Continuum Transfuctioner to reverse time to the very begining of the movie.In the morning, Jesse and Chester can't remember the night before, but at least they find the car outside (which was hidden behind a mail truck this whole time) and drive to The Twins house where they exchange gifts and receive a special gift from the Keepers of the Continuum Transfunctioner. They get in the car to drive and get some Chinese Foooood."
Two potheads wake up after a night of partying and cannot remember where they parked their car.::Anonymous
"Roommates Jesse and Chester, both who have more than just a few cards short of a full deck, are stoner dudes who don't even do their jobs as pizza delivery guys well. They awaken one morning having little recollection of what they did the previous night, due to being wasted. They discover that their kitchen is full of prepackaged pudding, how they got all the pudding they are unaware. From a telephone message they receive, they come to the realization that at some point during the previous night they were at a party at the house of their girlfriends, twins Wanda and Wilma, and that today is their one year anniversary, which they did remember as they already bought the twins gifts. But the worst thing in not remembering what happened last night is that Jesse's car is missing. In trying to find out what happened to the car, they believe they have to recreate the feeling and mindset of last night, meaning getting wasted all over again. In trying to find the car, they, being the types that area easily distracted, get sidetracked by one item after another, most specifically the potential of having sex with hot babes (sex with which Wanda and Wilma have not yet provided them), and learning that they apparently had a suitcase filled with $200,000 last night, the suitcase and therefore the money to which they don't know what happened. During their day of discovery, they also end up encountering one group of alien wannabes, and two groups of actual aliens, all three groups who are after the continuum transfunctioner which they believe Jesse and Chester have. Jesse and Chester don't know where it is let alone what it is, but these three groups seem to be willing to do whatever necessary to get it from Jesse and Chester. In the process, Jesse and Chester may have to make decisions which may not only save their lives and those of Wanda, Wilma and their best friend Nelson, a zen-master, but that of the entire universe. But most importantly, they may actually find Jesse's car after all is said and done.::Huggo"

"Earl Hickey is a ne'er do well without a job or a direction in life. Instead, he spends his days drinking beer, stealing whatever isn't bolted down and being a leech on society. But when he wins the lottery of a lifetime, Earl thinks his luck may have just changed...until he's hit by a car. As he recovers in a hospital bed, Earl realizes that maybe the reason why he's there is because of a simple five letter word: karma. For every rotten thing he's done, a rotten thing comes right back to him; and the only way he can stop that is to make good for every bad deed. Having compiled a lengthy list of things he's done to people, Earl sets out to right all the wrongs from his past. All of this on the promise that maybe, he can enjoy his fortune once and for all, but only if he can finish the list first.

Although life hasnt turned out the way they once dreamed, life-long buddies Mark, McGriff and Jason are managing to stay above water in their small Pennsylvania hometown. Mark, whose fleeting college football glory has morphed into a dangerous obsession with gambling, is becoming more and more estranged from his wife Sherry and son Hayden. McGriff has never let go of his rock-n-roll aspirations, but somehow hes not the man he used to be. Hes complacent, though, because of his lovely wife Kate. And then theres Jason, whos still living with his parents and letting them dictate his life.
The guys are in for a few surprises. A shady collector forces his way into Marks home to settle a debt, scaring Sherry into leaving with Hayden. As if thats not enough, Marks father passes away, leaving him with the unresolved tension in their relationship. Meanwhile, McGriff comes home from work early and finds his wife in a compromising position with another man. (Who ironically is a big fan of McGriffs) What to do when life deals you hard knocks? Jason has the solution: With the College Football Championship Bowl tickets he won in an employee drawing at Office Max, the three friends set out on a road trip from Pennsylvania to the Sunshine State.
Things dont go as smoothly as planned, though. McGriff is driving everyone crazy with the guitar he insisted on bringing, Jason lets the map fly out the window, and Mark overhears a once-in-a-lifetime betting tip that he cant act on. Somewhere between setting Vanna Whites ancestral home on fire to almost getting eaten by gators to receiving pseudo-prophetic advice from a one-arm carnie, tensions rise between the three friends and the shortcomings of each become apparent.
They ultimately find themselves on the edge of a bridge with a pact to jump off together. The beer talking? Perhaps. Marks near-fall brings them back to reality and sets them on a new line of thought. If they just faked their own deaths it would give them all a chance to start anew. That decided, they push Marks prized vintage car into an alligator infested swamp.
But starting a new life is not as easy as it seems. They still have the same problems, the same heartaches, the same failed dreams. Disgruntled and bitter, their true feelings rush out, and the trio angrily disbands. On their own they begin to discover what is really important. For Mark, its his family, and being the kind of father his father was. For McGriff, its finally taking a stand and reclaiming the confidence he once had. For Jason, its a girl named Janice who can throw a mean game of darts and who loves him for who he already is. And of course, for all three, its each other.
Two Tickets to Paradise is a comedy that is both hilarious and heartwarming. It takes us on a journey of lost dreams and underappreciated treasures and reminds us that in this crazy, uncertain world, the one thing we can count on is our friends.

Much to Chili's pleasure, she turns to be a great young R&B singer, but she's stuck in a girl group - The Chicks (?!) - with two horrific plastic surgery victims who sing like drowned cats.After the set finishes Linda comes off stage to sit with Chili and admits she's desperate to get into something other than the music business. It's going nowhere for her. Chili, ever the entertainment buff, is amazed by her pessimism. As far as he's concerned, Linda's dynamite.Linda replies by describing her manager, Raji (Vince Vaughn), a white guy convinced he's a black playa, who dresses like a pimp and treats Linda like a member of his stable. Raji's occupying a booth on one side of the club, accompanied by his gay bodyguard Elliot (The Rock), and quickly proves to be everything Linda said and less.Chili decides on the spot to deal with this problem by coolly declaring himself Linda's new manager. Raji isn't happy with this one bit, but after Chili throws Elliot to the floor by his throat, no one's in a position to argue. Chili suggests that he'll see if he can get an audition for Elliot, who's an aspiring actor.Segway to a scene the next morning where we meet Sin LaSalle (Cedric the Entertainer), successful and caring black father, calmly cooking pancake breakfast in his suburban mansion for his young daughter, who he patiently dotes over. Sin goes outside to get the paper and waves to his whitebread neighbors as a convoy of hummers pulls up outside.It turns out this is Sin's posse - he's a highly successful gangsta rap producer and agent, who reps a multi-platinum group, the DubMD's. Despite the careful upper middle-class face he presents to his daughter, Sin will happily cap anyone who messes with his music business, and the posse have returned from kidnapping a radio executive who isn't playing Sin's records enough for Sin's liking. With the troupe of steroid abusing gang-bangers looking on respectfully, Sin proceeds to slap the radio exec silly in the back of a hummer with the pancake spatula.The next day Chili goes to see old acquaintance Edie Athens (Uma Thurman), Tommy's estranged wife. He finds her wearing only a bikini and sleeping off her drunken salute to her dead husband, and Chili slowly pulls her together. It's obvious he cares for her, but also sees in her his entrance into the music business, through the record label she started with Tommy, TLS Records, and her ancient music industry connections from her days travelling with Aerosmith (as their clothes washer).Chili and Edie meet with Tommy's goth assistant who shows them some evidence the Russians left at TLS, and describes Tommy's last meeting with them, which is where the Russian boss got the black eye. Chili quickly infers that the Russians were trying to pull a protection scam on Tommy, who wasn't buying because he used to run protection rackets himself back in Brooklyn. One ticked off Russian later, Tommy's dead.Chili takes Edie to see Linda perform at a local community center, and Edie's impressed. She agrees that TLS will produce Linda's record. Linda's ecstatic - she's finally moving forward again.Meanwhile, Raji meets up with his business partner Nick Carr (Harvey Keitel) at their promotion company - Carousel Promotions. It's quickly clear that Nick really runs things, since Raji's a useless poseur, and that Nick's a former mob guy himself. Nick's got big plans for Linda Moon and The Chicks and he's not impressed with Chili Palmer, former loan shark, and dispatches Raji to hire Nick's old school hitman contact - Joe Loop (Robert Pastorelli) - to take Chili out.At the TLS offices, Chili has problems. Edie's in house record producer, Hy Gordon, likes Linda's voice and talent, but describes how they'll need to come up with some sort of hook to her sound, or the record simply won't catch on. Obviously this won't be quite as easy as Chili thought. Edie announces that TLS is broke, according to Tommy's accounting books, so they can't afford to make the record anyway, and Edie is not at all thrilled to find out that Chili doesn't actually have Linda's recording contract. Worse, the books reveal that TLS owes a good chunk of change to the DubMD's, who TLS recorded early in their career.Speak of the devil - Sin pulls into the parking lot with his convoy of hummers and comes in looking for the $300,000 TLS owes him, accompanied by the steroid posse and a lot of guns. Chili manages to make it look like TLS is still a reasonably thriving concern, but he can't stop Edie from freaking out and revealing that TLS can't pay Sin. Chili defuses the situation with a promise that he'll get the money by the end of the week, which Sin reluctantly accepts.That night, after dinner with Edie, Chili goes home to find a dead Russian with a gun sitting at his kitchen table. Looks like the Russians tried to get rid of the witness to Tommy's shooting, but someone shot the Russian hitter through the kitchen window with a rifle. Chili calls a mob enforcer friend to help him identify the body, then calls the police. Chili doesn't have anything to hide in this, after all.Meanwhile, Nick Carr has found out about the botched hit and sends Raji to straighten it out with Joe Loop. As far as Nick's concerned, it's Raji's problem. Joe, an old time slob of a serious mob guy, hates Raji's poseur guts and forces him to agree to pre-pay for another attempt on Chili.Nick comes home that night to find Chili waiting for him. Chili coolly demands Linda's contract, but Nick isn't having any of it. He tells Chili how almost everyone in the music business is a mobster, so Chili's intimidation act won't work. Meanwhile, Raji's meeting Joe Loop the hitter to pay for Chili's killing, but when Joe starts to choke on a sandwich Raji seizes the opportunity to regain some self-respect by beating Scary guy Joe to death with a baseball bat. Raji and Elliot dump Joe's body in the park.The next morning Chili's mob friend Freddie helps him find a pawn shop where the Russians are known to hang out. Chili doesn't have to worry about confronting the Russians in the shop, because it's under FBI surveillance, and everyone knows it. Chili, never one to be intimidated, gives the Russian boss another black eye and beats up an enforcer or two, just to make a point. Now the Russians really aren't happy.The police detectives catch up with Chili and ask him about Joe's body, found in the park. Chili happily identifies Joe from the photos, and guesses that he was the hitman who shot the Russian, but of course doesn't know anything about Joe's murder.The next day Chili and Edie go to a basketball game where Chili has arranged for floor tickets next to Steven Tyler from Aerosmith. Sure enough, he remembers Edie from her groupie days and they reconnect. After the game Chili charms Steven and gets him to agree to consider letting Linda sing at Aerosmith's upcoming concert.When they get home to Edie's house Elliot is waiting to ambush them with Raji's bat, but Chili once again deals with Elliot without great difficulty. Once again, Chili also charms Elliot with promises of an audition, even though the bodyguard was ticked off that Chili hadn't come through already. Chili sends Elliot on his way, keeping the bat.Nick Carr finds out about the Russians wanting Chili dead and makes an arrangement with them by way of he'll get Chili back to the pawn shop, and the Russians will kill him. They'll both be happy.The next day Linda doesn't show up at TLS Records and Chili has to go rescue her from the Viper Room, where she's practically being held prisoner by Nick and Raji in preparation for that night's stage performance. Linda isn't too happy with Chili, having not heard anything from him for the last couple days, and is starting to doubt he can do anything for her. All is forgiven after he reveals she'll be singing with Aerosmith.As a parting gift, Chili tells Nick about Joe's murder, having easily deduced from the police info that Raji killed him, which is news to Nick. Nick isn't happy with anyone now, but tells Chili he can have Linda's contract if he can pick it up, and presents Chili with a pawn ticket.The next day the police come by Edie's house with a few more questions about Tommy, and Edie gives the detective the pawn ticket, pretending to have found it in Tommy's desk. The black detective goes to the Russians' shop, who are forced to hand over the envelope Nick left with them, which of course is empty. Now the Russians aren't happy again, since they still haven't got Chili Palmer.After Nick tells Raji that he'll have to kill Chili personally, or be killed himself, Raji decides he'll have to make a move against his partner Nick. Knowing about the TLS debt to Sin LaSalle, Raji phones, and while insulting him wildly, tells Sin that Nick Carr has forced TLS to pay Carousel 300K for Linda's contract, instead of paying Sin. Since Raji's an idiot, Sin easily uses Last Call Display to find out who phoned.Meanwhile, Chili sends his friend Freddie to leave a package at the pawn shop with the Russians, which the Russians accept, not knowing the connection to Chili.That afternoon Sin and the steroid brigade burst into Nick's office at Carousel packing guns and dragging a much abused Raji behind them. The posse hangs Raji off the outside balcony, much to Nick's pleasure, while Sin threatens to kill Nick for interfering with Sin's money, much to Nick's dismay. Things get worse for Nick when the Russians show up and pull guns on everyone.Nick tries to explain to the Russians that it isn't his fault the setup on Chili failed and the police showed up instead, but the Russians aren't convinced, and insult Sin's ethnicity when he tries to claim first dibs on Nick's life. Sin gets the upper hand again when some late arriving gang-bangers get the drop on the Russians. After a great speech about lack of respect for black contributions to culture, Sin calmly shoots the Russian boss, takes Linda's contract form Nick, just so Chili can't get it, then leaves Nick and Raji with the body.That night Linda performs with Steven Tyler at the Aerosmith concert and kills (even though it's a crappy performance in the movie), much to Chili and Edie's relief and pleasure. Chili finally gets he also wants later that night at Edie's house.All is not over though. Chili wakes up in the middle of the night and finds Sin and his posse sitting in Edie's living room. It's after midnight Friday morning and Sin wants his money immediately, in exchange for Linda's contract, or he'll happily kill Chili right there for all the trouble he's caused.Edie comes down a few minutes later, expecting the worst, and finds Sin and Chili happily sitting together listening to Linda's demo CD. After Chili convinced him to listen to it, Sin quickly realized that she had the talent to make it big, and Chili's agreed to let Sin produce the album which will net Sin a lot more money than the 300K TLS owes him. Even better for Chili and Edie, with Sin's name and distinctive sound on Linda's album, it will be a guaranteed success.Chili suggests that they get a famous music video director for Linda's debut video, but Sin scoffs that the director's too unavailable. Chili calmly takes back control of the whole situation and relationship by mentioning that the director was a PA on Chili's first movie. Everyone's happy.Except for Nick and Raji. They ambush Chili and Edie a little while later at Linda's video shoot, and take them down the street for payback. Chili gives up his pawn ticket to Nick, claiming that it's where Linda's contract is, but Nick isn't worried now that the Russian boss is dead, and leaves Raji and Elliot to kill Chili and Edie.After Chili gets Elliot to check his text messages, finding a message about an audition for a Nicole Kidman movie, the bodyguard changes sides against Raji, who's been abusing poor deluded Elliot throughout the film. Raji ends up fleeing into some video pyrotechnics and setting himself on fire, all of which is filmed in the video.The next day Nick picks up Chili's package at the pawn shop, but discovers to his confusion that it's only a baseball bat. The police burst in, having been alerted by Chili, and arrest him for Joe Loop's murder, which is hard for Nick to explain since he's holding the murder weapon.The movie ends at the MTV Video Awards, where Linda wins for best new artist and video, and thanks Edie, Sin, and most of all, Chili.Raji is now famous for the footage of him running through Linda's video with his pimp outfit on fire.On an interesting note, the various actors from the movie solo dance behind the end credits. Other than Travolta, most of the recognizable actors aren't great dancers, while most of the unknowns, including several of the guys who play nameless Russians, are surprisingly good."

"Nancy Weston (Amy Farrell), a reporter for The Globe, a local Chicago newspaper, approaches Abraham Gentry (Frank Kress), an obnoxious, crack shot private investigator, on behalf of The Globe, which offers him $25,000 to investigate the brutal murder of stripper Suzie Cream Puff (Jackie Kroeger) who was brutally murdered in her dressing room at the nightclub where she performed. They sweeten the deal with a $25,000 bonus for solving the case. Of course this comes contingent that The Globe gets the exclusive story. Gentry takes the case and begins the investigation of the murder with Weston in tow.At the strip club, Gentry encounters a waitress, named Marlene (Hedda Lubin), whose obnoxiousness rivals his. He neverless gets through to her so he can speak to another stripper and gets his first suspect whom is Joseph Carter, a local business man who frequented the club.Soon another stripper, named Candy Cane, gets murdered and Gentry expands his suspect list to Grout (Ray Sager), the club's bartender who turns out to be an unstable war veteran who took pride in crushing the heads of corpses he found when on the battlefields of Vietnam. Grout relieves tension by drawing faces on squashes and tomatoes then crushes them with his bare fists. Gentry also suspects the leader of a radical feminist group that riots in the strip club carrying banners with catchy phrases like ""Lewd is Crude"", ""Quit with Tit"", and ""Women Right On!""That evening, the unseen killer strikes again by sneaking into another apartment and committing an over-the-top gory murder of another dancer, named Pickles, which included mutilating her buttocks with a meat tenderizer hammer and salt and peppering it. A badge with ""Women Right On!"" is found at the scene by the police which Gentry arrives shortly thereafter and thinks someone else might be doing the killing.The next day, Gentry buys Weston many drinks to keep her drunk and out of his way. During one of Nancy Weston's drunken episodes she admits that she's attracted to Gentry. Gentry ignores this and concentrates on the case. His investigation takes him to the owner of most of the strip clubs in town, Mr. Marzdone Mobilie (Henry Youngman). Gentry then coerces Mobilie into holding an amateur stripper contest with a $1,000 prize, which also works as the beginning of a plan for Gentry's trap.After having a few too many drinks, Gentry encourages Weston to perform the amateur stripper contest in which she goes all out by ""taking it all off"" and wins the $1,000 cash prize. Gentry accompanies Weston back to her apartment and lets her rest on her couch as he seemingly leaves. Soon, the killer arrives and Gentry, who anticipated that the killer would do just that, appears after hiding behind a door and takes off the killer's hood revealing Marlene. He also further reveals more when he pulls off her shirt revealing burn marks on her chest, literally obscuring her breasts. After a brief struggle, Marlene falls out a balcony window and lands on the street below where her head is crushed by an oncoming car.Gentry then reveals his case in a long monologue to Nancy Weston about following the clues which Gout told him earlier about Marlene being burned in a fire which her breasts were burned off. This drew the conclusion that she was killing all those strippers out of jealousy and hatred to their own beauty which Marlene's was now taken from her. Weston is somewhat angry that Gentry used her as bait to trap Marlene into revealing herself as the killer, but accepts for the risk was worth it. Gentry and Weston profess their love for each other as she tells him that the story will make a great contribution to the Globe and both of them get ""down to business"" (making out), before Gentry looks at the camera and tells the viewers that it's over and to leave them alone.The closing title card then appears reading: ""We thankfully announce that this movie is over!""

"Lampooning the tendencies of 'reality television' to become ever more shocking, 'Series 7: The Contenders' is a movie of an imagined reality show in which the contestants, tracked by cameramen, must kill to win.Selected at random and seemingly with government approval, the contestants are real people, dropped into a real town, and given weapons with which to wipe each other out. The winner is the last one left alive, and the 'game' is not over until all but one of the contestants are dead.Heavily pregnant Dawn is the current champion, and she is only a few kills awaw from being allowed retire from the show. Pregnancy and the will to get out of the game have made her pragmatic about her modus operandi: kill everybody in her way.Those fighting against her are an elderly gentleman, a female teenage high school student, a cold-hearted middle-aged nurse, and a man recovering from testicular cancer.Dawn's mission is complicated however, by virtue of the fact that cancer-sufferer Jeff is an old flame from high school. Ironically at the start of the contest, Jeff is ready to die, but suicide is against the rules, so he wants Dawn to be the one to bump him off. However, as the game progresses, Jeff's motives change, and this confuses Dawn's situation.The movie builds towards a showdown between the two high-school sweethearts. In this crazy situation, who will be the last one standing?-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The movie opens with Dawn walking into a convenience store, coming up behind a man who's buying something at the counter, jamming a 9mm into his back and killing him.Dawn, who is eight months pregnant, is the reigning champion of The Contenders, a reality show where five people are selected at random by government issued ID numbers to face each other and the reigning champion in a no-holds-barred fight to the finish. Contestants are issued firearms and placed into a selected town for their manhunt. Viewers watch the show in episodes like regular reality TV.The town selected for this battle is the sleepy little town of Newton, CT.Dawn and her cameraman, Pat, arrive by plane and drive into town. Facing off against her are Tony, an unemployed, struggling, but still well-to-do family man; Connie, a middle-aged nurse with a heart of ice but who is deeply religious and opposed to killing; Franklin, an elderly retiree who uses a crutch; Lindsey, a teenage girl who's just graduated high school; and Jeff, a married thirtysomething man who's dying of testicular cancer. All five challenger Contenders are residents of the town.Actions scenes are interspersed with continues ""interview promos"" with each contestant that are meant to build up drama and storyline for each contestant. Breaks for commercial and end-of-episodes are shown with ""coming soon"" scenes.Tony is in good physical shape and skilled in boxing. Lindsey's parents and boyfriend have supplied her with a generous cache of weapons and a bulletproof vest. Jeff's wife, Doria, dutifully takes care of him as his condition worsens and frets at what is to come. Dawn calls both Tony and Connie to taunt them. Dawn tells Connie that a bomb is in her apartment. Connie runs out screaming, and Dawn fires at her, but misses, and Connie retreats back into her home.Dawn visits her family, who don't want to see her but she confronts her mother and sister in the garage. Although Dawn tries to maintain composure, the bitter argument she wanted to avoid, slams into her head-on. It's shown that the family threw Dawn out after she became pregnant as a teenager and had an abortion. Finally Dawn steals her sister's SUV-- at gunpoint, no less- but as she's settling into the driver's seat, Dawn's little niece runs to her and hugs her proudly, supporting Dawn as champion contender.Dawn is driven to Tony's house and calls him out to fight her. But, rebelling against all the show stands for, Tony takes his baby daughter hostage and drives off. This being a serious violation of the show's rules, show promoters and police cooperate to track Tony's vehicle as it drives down a highway and disable it. There is a tense standoff between Tony and a SWAT officer before the officer manages to take the baby girl from Tony. Tony runs, but several SWAT officers grab them. In the struggle, Tony deals himself a critical wound to his back with his own knife and is paralyzed.Tony is in the hospital when Connie comes into his room and administers a lethal injection. Tony tries to plead with Connie regarding his being helpless to resist, to no avail. Dawn finds her way to Tony's room to find him already dead. Tony's wife, Michelle, lashes out at Dawn, who pleads for understanding, pointing out her own pregnancy-- Dawn is nearly ready to give birth to her baby. An amusing scene shows Dawn getting a checkup with a local physician, and a nurse aide asks Dawn to sign an autograph. The aide gives a big grin as she's presented with the autograph.LIndsey's parents drive her to Franklin's house and get her psyched up to make the kill. She runs to take Franklin down. She chases him into high brush grass and a shot rings out. Lindsey comes stumbling back to her parents' car, wounded but alive, and without her handgun.Dawn calls Jeff and asks to see him. As she arrives at Jeff's house, Dawn promises Doria that she will not harm Jeff; she's just there to talk. The interview promos, complete with re-created re-enactments, show that Dawn and Jeff are old high school flames who did a Gothic video art project together. They still feel close to one another. Jeff tells Dawn that he'd rather die at her hand than one of the other contenders. Still, he's afraid of being killed, and so he tells Dawn how she can acquire some barbiturates; Jeff has needles that she can use to administer a lethal injection.As Lindsey is convalescing, her parents find her making love to her boyfriend, Nathan. Lindsey's father has a letter for her. It's shown that Franklin and Dawn have received similar letters. An unknown benefactor is offering to take them to safety. The contenders accepting the offer should go to a particular concession stand at a nearby mall and wait.Dawn arrives first, concerned about the message being some sort of trap. Franklin goes there hoping to score a kill against one or more of the other contenders. Lindsey arrives, taking the offer at face value and looking to escape, though she still has a 9mm handgun with her. As Dawn hides out of sight but able to see the concession stand, now closed for the night, Franklin arrives. Franklin spots Lindsey coming up a mall escalator and approaching the stand. He hides behind the stand and waits. Dawn spots the intended ambush and shouts a warning, but it's too late. Franklin clobbers the teenage girl with his crutch and begins to beat her savagely in front of her horrified family and onlookers. Lindsey manages to pull her gun, and fires at Franklin, but the gun's safety jams. Franklin knocks the gun out of Lindsey's hand and beats her to death as people must stand by and watch. Franklin begins to make a hateful speech toward everyone, including those who would be watching on TV, when he's killed by a shot from a high-powered rifle. The shooter is Connie, who sent the letters as a trap, just as Dawn had feared. Dawn chases Connie all the way back to her apartment and corners her in the bathroom, but just as Dawn is ready to shoot Connie, her water breaks and she goes into labor.An amusing scene plays out where Dawn must beg for a truce with Connie, and for Connie's help in delivering the baby, who Dawn protests is an innocent life. Connie reluctantly agrees and calls for an ambulance before administering aid. Complications arise as the baby's feet start to come out first; a breech birth that can lead to severe birth injury or even the baby's death. ER workers on the phone manage to talk Connie through a procedure that keeps the baby unharmed until paramedics arrive to complete the delivery.In the meantime, Jeff and Doria have a tender last night over dinner and drinks, holding each other, as Jeff waits for Dawn to return.The next scenes show Dawn at the hospital with her baby, and Jeff waking up from unconsciousness at the same hospital, Doria watching over him. Promo interviews show that in violation of show rules, Jeff prepared his own suicide with Doria assisting him. However, Jeff's cameraman called paramedics who saved Jeff's life. Jeff becomes angry, knowing Doria let them into the house. They fall into an emotional argument where Doria accuses Jeff of still being in love with Dawn-- and yet, at the same time, a closet bisexual, before walking out on him. Doria gives Jeff his gun back and dares him to kill himself.Connie stealthily walks through the hospital to deliver another lethal injection. It's Jeff's room she goes into, but Jeff is ready for her. They wrestle over Jeff's gun, and a shot rings out. Dawn hears the shot and goes to investigate. Jeff has killed Connie, and he stuns Dawn with the announcement that he feels a new lease on life and doesn't want to die anymore. He manages to rush out of the hospital while Dawn struggles with her feelings over him versus her need to kill him as he's the only other contender left. The scene also implies that Jeff is the father of Dawn's first baby, which she had to abort, which in turn got her thrown out of her family's house.After promo interviews, and end-of-show coming attractions, Dawn and Jeff are seen meeting at a local football field to finish the conflict. If Dawn kills Jeff, she'll be able to retire from the show a free woman and reunited with her baby. If Jeff kills Dawn, he'll become the new reigning champion contender to face off against five challengers next season.The two face each other, guns drawn, and suddenly announce their love for each other. They beat their respective cameramen unconscious and escape together. Viewers help police and shot promoters track the two, now wanted fugitives.Dawn and Jeff stage a desperate gambit, taking the audience of a movie theater hostage. Dawn's demands are simple: return of her baby and safe passage out of the country.Show announcers say that all the remaining footage ended up deleted due to technical error but has been painstakingly re-created and re-enacted through actors. A show announcer arrives at the theater to turn Dawn and Jeff against each other. The crying of Dawn's baby is played through the theater's speakers as the announcer says that Dawn can have her baby if she kills Jeff here and now.Jeff suddenly reverts to wanting Dawn to win and to be with her baby. He chooses to give up his life for the sake of the woman he loves. Jeff closes his eyes, and tears roll down Dawn's eyes as she starts to squeeze the trigger.But it's Dawn who falls dead before the movie screen. Jeff wasn't the one who killed her.Doria is seen at the back of the theater holding a smoking gun. She tells Jeff that she still loves him. Jeff looks coldly back at his wife and says it's too late. He puts his gun to his temple and takes his own life, putting himself beyond the reach of the law.End of season finale promos show Dawn's baby in the care of Dawn's sister, and Doria in prison, facing execution for murder without being a registered Contender. She boldly and bitterly accuses the public of being the true killers.The final promo announcement is that five new challengers will soon be selected to face off... against the new reigning champion Contender.The camera pans in on Jeff in the hospital, his head bandaged. He opens his eyes, understands he's still alive, and disgustedly says, ""Shit.""

"Set against the backdrop of the Cold War and Soviet political repression of the early 1980s prior to perestroika, Moscow on the Hudson tells the story of Vladimir Ivanoff (Robin Williams), a saxophonist with the Moscow circus.The story begins in New York with Vladimir advising a newly arrived Frenchman that he is on the wrong New York bus and giving him instructions on how to get to his destination. He then tells the Frenchman that it is always difficult getting around the city when one first arrives. Vladimir then begins remembering his own arrival to New York from Russia, and the scene shifts to Vladimir riding on a Russian bus some time earlier.Vladimir exits the bus and immediately witnesses a group of three people holding signs being accosted by two men, likely KGB agents or secret police, who force them into a nearby car and confiscate their signs. Vladimir then inquires of a passing Russian soldier if the nearby queue is for toilet paper; the soldier replies that it is for shoes. Vladimir joins the queue and obtains three pairs of shoes in the only size (38) now available.Vladimir arrives late to rehearsal at the circus and Boris (Savely Kramarov), one of the apparatchik assigned to the circus, criticizes him harshly and implies that he may miss the approaching trip to New York City. Vladimir tells him the reason he was late and ultimately gives Boris one pair of shoes obtained from the queue.Later, while Vladimir is riding with his friend, circus clown Anatoly Cherkasov (Elya Baskin), in Anatoly's Lada, Anatoly begins expressing his discontent with life in Russia, claiming that he is an oppressed artist. Vladimir expresses disinterest in Anatoly's complaints. Anatoly stops to buy fuel for his car from a mobile black-market gasoline dealer. While the friends wait for the gasoline seller to fill Anatoly's jerrycans, the two practice their English. Anatoly reveals to Vladimir in English that he plans to defect during the upcoming trip to New York. Vladimir is disconcerted that Anatoly has told him this as he is obligated to inform on him. Anatoly shouts in English at the uncomprehending fuel seller and oblivious passing motorists that he wants to see the world.Anatoly leaves Vladimir at another queue; as Vladimir exits the vehicle, Anatoly asks if he will be coming by the apartment at 9:00 p.m. as usual and Vladimir agrees. After inquiring and determining that toilet paper can be purchased at this queue, Vladimir begins to walk to the end of the excessively long line but meets with a neighborhood friend, Leonid, already standing in line. During the ensuing conversation, Leonid reveals that he was once a teacher but is now paving roads after the authorities had sent him to a camp for protesting the war in Afghanistan. Leonid also reveals that the authorities had declared him to be crazy for protesting the war. After agreeing to talk later, Leonid advises Vladimir to never go crazy.Vladimir returns home to his family, who are overjoyed that he has obtained toilet paper. Vladimir announces that he won't be staying for dinner as he is meeting Svetlana. Vladimir's mother expresses a desire for Vladimir to marry Svetlana, and Vladimir remarks that he doesn't want another marriage.Vladimir meets with Svetlana, and they both walk to Anatoly's apartment for their date. Svetlana expresses a desire for Vladimir to join the communist party as it would make obtaining an apartment when they get married easier; Vladimir responds that he is not a ""joiner"". At the apartment, after Anatoly leaves, Vladimir gives Svetlana a gift -- a roll of toilet paper. Svetlana expresses her jealousy that Vladimir gets to see America without her and hints that she would like Vladimir to obtain designer jeans for her.Vladimir returns home drunk from vodka. In the morning, around the breakfast table, Vladimir's grandfather, Nicholai Ivanoff, aggressively criticizes the news reports on the television and Russia's leaders in general. As Vladimir is leaving the building with packed suitcases for the circus trip to America, he is intercepted by the two circus-assigned apparatchik waiting at the entrance. They question Vladimir about his grandfather's anti-Soviet behavior and imply that he may be senile and need to be committed. Vladimir responds that he is just a comedian, an old man, and a war hero who should just be ignored. They also reveal that they are aware that Vladimir and Svetlana have been using Anatoly's apartment for their ""sexual encounters"". Both agents finally reveal that they want Vladimir to ""keep an eye on"" Anatoly Cherkasov during the trip to America in exchange for protecting his grandfather.The Moscow circus arrives in New York and are shuttled around in a chartered bus. The performers are amused at the colorful environment that is New York, which strongly contrasts with the bleak surrounding of Moscow (as portrayed earlier). During the bus ride, Anatoly writes ""freedom"" in the dust on the bus window, and Vladimir quickly wipes it off.The performers stay at the Howard Johnson Hotel, and Vladimir and Anatoly happen to be sharing a room. Vladimir revels in the American custom of taking the towels, which he packs into his suitcase, and the quality of the toilet paper. Vladimir reveals to Anatoly that it is no coincidence they are sharing a room together because the apparatchik watching over the circus want him to ""spy on"" Anatoly.During a formal reception, Anatoly reveals to Vladimir that he intends to defect during the opening parade and his opening bicycle routine; Vladimir remarks, ""Good. They grab you and throw you right to bear"". Vladimir and Anatoly enter a bathroom, and the two Apparatchik, who have been shadowing Anatoly throughout the evening, emerge from the same toilet stall just as Anatoly was about to comment on his plans. The Apparatchik comment that they will soon be back in Moscow, but otherwise all leave the bathroom without further drama.The next day during the opening circus performance, Anatoly attempts to defect but is met by the Apparatchik agents.The following day, the performers are allowed to shop at Bloomingdale's for 30 minutes before going to the airport to return to Russia. Vladimir meets a perfume clerk at Bloomingdale's, Lucia Lomardo (María Conchita Alonso), while attempting to find blue jeans for Svetlana. Anatoly once more reveals to Vladimir that he is going to defect in Bloomingdale's. Vladimir angrily challenges Anatoly to just do it and stop informing him of the plan. However, Anatoly is shadowed by the quieter of the Apparatchik and loses his nerve.As the performers are being led back to the bus, Vladimir attempts to buy the designer jeans for Svetlana. Anatoly seemingly dares Vladimir to defect in his stead. Vladimir then attempts to defect to one of Bloomingdale's security guards, Lionel Witherspoon (Cleavant Derricks). A clerk announces the defection, and the Apparatchik, who are distracted by their own shopping, rush over to prevent it. A chase ensues through Bloomingdale's, out onto the street, and back into Bloomingdale's. Vladimir then attempts to hide behind Lucia's counter. Orlando Ramirez (Alejandro Rey), an immigration lawyer, approaches and gives Lucia his card to give to Vladimir. After trying to hide inside Lucia's dress, Vladimir crawls away through Bloomingdale's but once again encounters Lionel. Boris and the other Apparatchik arrive and confront Vladimir, but Lionel defends him. Boris first pleads with Vladimir to return and then threatens, but Vladimir repeats, ""I defect"", to the cheers of the rapidly assembling crowd. Connie Chung and an ABC News crew are already on scene. The FBI arrive and interview Vladimir about why he is defecting and whether or not he has relatives or friends in America. Lionel, basking in the glare of the media, offers to take in Vladimir after revealing he knows no one in America outside of Lionel and Lucia. As a final parting gesture, Vladimir rushes out onto the street as the charted bus of circus performers is leaving and says goodbye to his saxophone, which had been left on the bus. He also communicates to Anatoly that he is now free (a free bird).Lionel Witherspoon (Cleavant Derricks), an African American security guard who has just protected Vladimir from his furious Russian handlers during Vladimir's defection at Bloomingdale's, takes him home to Harlem to live with Lionel's mother, unemployed father, sister, and cranky but good-hearted grandfather--a living arrangement noticeably similar to that of Vladimir's family back in Moscow.With the help of sympathetic immigration attorney Orlando Ramirez (Alejandro Rey), a naturalized citizen from Cuba who witnessed Vladimir's defection, Vladimir soon adapts to life in America. Vladimir attempts to find work despite speaking little English and fearing the threat of his former KGB handlers. He initially lives in poor neighborhoods and takes low-paying jobs such as fast-food service, limousine driver, and sidewalk merchant.Vladimir starts a relationship with Lucia. At a party celebrating Lucia's becoming an American citizen, Vladimir proposes to her; but she refuses and breaks up with him. A little while later, Lionel decides to move to Alabama to be with his young son; and Vladimir learns from a friend of his sister that his beloved grandfather back home in Moscow has died.Grieving, Vladimir goes to a Russian nightclub to ease his mind. When he returns home, late to his apartment building and drunk, he is mugged by two young men. He later reports the incident to the police with Orlando present, and the two go to a diner where Vladimir rants about his misfortunes. A nearby Russian immigrant overhears the conversation, and interrupts Vladimir to disagree, leading the two into a tense confrontation that is settled after Vladimir comes to appreciate his good fortune of living in America. Soon after, Lucia reunites with Vladimir telling him that she is not ready for marriage but would love to live with an immigrant, and Lionel moves back from Alabama and takes over Vladimir's job driving a limousine.In the end, Vladimir gets a job as a saxophonist in the band at the Russian nightclub, with time to play the music he loves during the day. He encounters the former apparatchik Boris operating a hot dog stand. (Boris had lost his status back in the Soviet Union after Vladimir's defection.) The former apparatchik is glad to see Vladimir and gives him a free hot dog, showing his appreciation for the life he too now has in America."

"Vladimir Ivanoff is a saxophonist with a Moscow based circus. Unlike his best friend, circus clown Anatoly, who hates all about living in the Soviet Union, Vladimir is generally content with his life, seeing the things with which he has to deal, such as standing in long lines for such basic items as toilet paper and shoes that don't fit, just part and parcel of his Soviet life. The circus is traveling to New York City for a show, during which time Anatoly plans to defect, which may be the worst kept secret within the circus, especially as their KGB handlers want Vladimir to spy on Anatoly about such plans. But when push comes to shove, it is Vladimir who senses an opportunity to defect, he doing so despite knowing that he will probably never see his family or friends back in the Soviet Union ever again. Vladimir has his own view of the American dream, the general concept of freedom which appeals to him the most despite not truly understanding what it means. He finds that almost everyone he meets, all immigrants in one form or another, all have their American dream, their own pursuit of which which may be incompatible with his own fulfillment of being an American.::Huggo"

Zucker drops his tissue as he watches Samuel come up to them. Zucker says that Samuel did not say that he was bringing his family, but Samuel insists that he did by using ""are,"" which is plural. Samuel says that it does not matter because they will stay at a hotel. Marlene insists that they stay with them at their house but Zucker and Samuel say that it is okay that they stay in a hotel. Golda (Golda Tencer), Samuel's wife, says that they will stay with Zucker. They leave the airport taking separate cars. Zucker goes with Samuel, Marlene goes with Golda and her son Joshua (Sebastian Blomberg), and Thomas goes with Lilly (Elena Uhlig), Samuel's daughter. They all start talking to each other as they drive. The movie cuts back and forth between all three cars.Golda tells Marlene how nervous she was on the plane and that she could not eat while her husband slept like a baby. Golda continues telling Marlene how she thought Zucker would be different because Samuel made him seem like Stalin. Golda changes the subject to talk about Thomas and says that he must be a playboy. Marlene shrugs smiling but does not respond.At the same time in a different car, Samuel gives Zucker their mother's most treasured possession, a pair of shoes and asked why Zucker never responded to any of her letters.Meanwhile, Lilly talks to Thomas. She tells him that she is a law student in her 22nd semester, but really she is a princess and her hobby is princes.They hit traffic and realize that they are not going to make it to the funeral on time. The man at the cemetery says that they can postpone the funeral until tomorrow at 2:00. Zucker claims that he is busy and Samuel asks what could be more important than saying goodbye to their mother. Zucker replies that she did not say goodbye to him. Samuel defends their mother saying that she couldn't because Zucker had gone to East Germany. Samuel says that they have to get along for a week. Zucker asks Samuel to let go of him and Samuel says that he is worse than he remembered and starts to call him names. Samuel storms off as everyone watches him.At Zucker's house they are all starting to sit down to have dinner. The Rabbi has come to read the will. He asks where Zucker's daughter is and Zucker says she could not make it. The Rabbi says he will make an exception and opens the envelope. The will says that Zucker and Samuel must both say ""yes"" to the inheritance to get it. Both of them agree and the Rabbi then reads the terms for the inheritance. First, they must sit shivah for 7 days. Their wives and children must join them as often as possible. They cannot be excused from the Shivah for any reason, barring sickness or death. The will says that they cannot sit in silence the whole time. They have to talk about what caused the rift between them and, finally, they have to reconcile their differences.Everyone leaves to let the brothers talk. Samuel admits to having some money problems and needs the inheritance. Zucker does not say that he has money problems too but Samuel seems to know. He tells Zucker that he owns the building that Zucker lives in. Samuel accuses Zucker of renting from the Stazi, but Zucker tells him that it was owned by the state. Zucker complains about Samuel raising the rent and Samuel said he paid communist rent before. After their argument, they toast to their mother. That night while in bed, Golda talks about Zucker's family. She says that Marlene is a goy the son is gay and the daughter is not around. She worries that their son Joshua will catch onto the scam and they will lose the inheritance. Marlene is shown worrying in bed trying to learn all the rules she needs to follow during the Shabbat. The movie goes back to Samuel and his wife. Samuel says that Golda must make sure that Marlene does not slip up and that he will find the daughter. The next day Thomas comes to Zucker's house and walks in on Joshua praying while doing pelvic thrusts. He leaves the room without saying anything. Everyone is starting to wake up now and go into the kitchen. Marlene tells Zucker to get Jana and gives him a pill. Golda says that Samuel would like to go to make sure there are no mistakes. They go to Jana's apartment. Zucker says that he is the mailman so that they will let him in. Sara answers the door and tells them that they are all still in bed. Samuel says that they could come back in an hour then introduces himself. Samuel and Zucker sit at the kitchen table talking. Both of them have a headache and Zucker gets some aspirin for them to take while they wait. Samuel asks if Zucker has a good relationship with his daughter. Zucker asks him why he wants to know. Samuel says that he has trouble with his daughter too. He does not approve of her lifestyle and says that a woman should have no more men in her life than fingers on her hand. Samuel asks if Zucker's daughter is the same way. Zucker says that she has had the same boyfriend for a while now. Jana comes out and introduces her ""boyfriend,"" which is a woman. Jana apologizes that he found out like this. Zucker forgives her and says that she gives him joy. Jana says that he does not have a loving heart. She was his ""gold metal girl"" but when she got pregnant and could not run the race, he wrote her off. She says that it has been that way ever since. Samuel looks shocked and says that he feels funny. Jana asks if he is okay and Zucker says that he has a migraine. Samuel says he feels strange and says it might have been the tap water or the aspirin he took. Jana asks how many he took and says that she is going to call a doctor. Zucker says that would be too much paperwork and says that he will take him to a friend of his.When they leave Samuel stops to dance to the music some kids are listening to outside. Zucker asks what they took and Jana says that they took some ecstasy. Zucker takes them to the nightclub that he owns. A girl takes Samuel off to give him a massage. Zucker says that he has to go because the tournament starts in an hour. He tells Jana that he never wrote her off, that she turned away from him because he was an idiot. He tells her that he still loves her. Jana says that he's high. He agrees and says that the funeral is nigh and leaves.The tournament is just about to begin. A man gives a speech about how the tournament has finally come to Berlin and that he wishes everyone luck. Zucker starts playing. Jana is shown in the audience watching him. Zucker does really well and wins his game in record time. He says that he will be back at 4pm. While Zucker is at the tournament, Samuel is dancing with one of the girls in the nightclub. He starts hallucinating that his wife is there laughing at his dancing. He is then shown lying down with only his boxers and socks on while the girl massages him.The family is at the cemetery waiting for Zucker, Samuel and Jana. Zucker and Samuel come up and hug each other. Marlene asks where Jana is. Jana says she is here. Joshua sees her and moves to the far side of the group. They all enter into the cemetery. The movie shows people dropping the coffin down into the hole while a man sings a prayer. Samuel tells his mother's favorite joke, which he relates to her always believing in Zucker and him. Samuel says that she told him that everything would be all right. He continues to say that she said that when the wall fell their family would be reunited, but when it fell the wall that divided their family never fell. He lamented that she ad to die before he could stand next to his brother again. After Samuel finished speaking Zucker grabbed his side and fell into the grave. Jana says that she will take him to the hospital.In the car, Zucker says that she does not have to worry about him and to drop him off here. She says that she is taking him back to the pool tournament. She says 100,000 is worth faking a heart attack. She watches him play for a while but leaves just before he finishes. He wins the game and checks the boards to find out when he plays next. He has a game at 2pm the next day.When Zucker gets home, everyone is at the dinner table singing. It looks like everyone had already eaten. After the song is over Samuel asks how he is doing. Zucker says that he is fine. Samuel said that Jana told everyone that he was given a check-up. Zucker says that the doctors told him to take it easy and that he would have a followup check-up the next day. The next day Marlene brings him breakfast. She says that she is going to the synagogue because it's Shabbes. She tells him that he should stay in bed. She asks him before she leaves not to pull any tricks. Zucker says that he won't.Zucker is seen at the pool tournament as he wins his game that afternoon. While Zucker is at the pool tournament everyone else is at the synagogue. After his game he watches the other men play. Zucker plays and wins another game before he leaves. Marlene comes home and reads the note that Zucker left. She is worried but Joshua says that she is not allowed to call the hospital. Just before the family leaves, Zucker comes home. Samuel tells him that they are going back to the synagogue for ma'ariv. Marlene follows him to the bedroom and tells him that she knows that he was not at the hospital. Zucker says that he was sent to a specialist, but does not continue because he does not think that Marlene believes him. She tells him that he better stay for the Shivah or else. When everyone has gone to the synagogue, Zucker calls Linda and says that he has made it into the quarter finals but needs her help. Zucker walks out of his room and sees that Lilly is coming on to Thomas. She says he is scared and walks away. They leave Zucker alone to go to the synagogue. Zucker stands outside with a stretcher and paramedics while Linda looks out for his family. Once she sees them, she tells him gets on the stretcher and Linda and the paramedics wheel him into an ambulance. Two people talk about Zucker's hard luck since the wall fell as he is taken away. Marlene runs up shouting ""Jacky"" and gets into the ambulance as it drives away. They go to the hospital. Marlene checks Zucker in while Zucker is taken into the elevator. He gets off the stretcher and quickly leaves to go back to the tournament. He sees his wife in the Cardiology area asking to see her husband. The woman at the desk takes her to see a man who is all bandaged up so that Marlene can't see who it is. Marlene starts crying and apologizes to Zucker for not believing that he was having heart problems. Zucker sneaks out while Marlene is talking to the stranger. Marlene says that she did not believe him because he is a very cunning liar and she loves him for it. The nurse comes back to Marlene and tells her that that is not her husband and that he is not checked into the hospital. Marlene is mad and walks off. Linda finds her and tells her that Zucker might have the Spanish flu. Marlene says that she recognizes her as Zucker's old secretary. Linda admits that is who she is. Zucker is seen in the office of the man in charge of the pool tournament. Zucker was 16 minutes late to his game and the first prize was awarded to another man. He tells Zucker that he can't change the rules for him. Zucker tells him that his mother died three days ago and that his orthodox brother is visiting. Zucker says that he must have something against Jews. The man says that he can't do anything to help him. Zucker goes to see the man who won first prize and tells him that he knows he would have beat him. The man decides to play him at his club at midnight after the finals. the winner of the game will get the 100,000 euros. Zucker is taken back to his house on a stretcher and taken into the living room. He sits down and tells everyone that his heart problems are over now. Everyone has something up to their faces to protect themselves from the flu they were told he had. He tells them that he has no virus and that they can sit shivah relaxed. Zucker walks off to bed. Marlene says that they should begin the reconciliation talks tomorrow. The next day, everyone is seen in the dining room with Marlene, Golda, Jana and her daughter sitting at the table staring at Zucker and his brother who sit next to each other by the window. Joshua sits across from the people at the table. No one says anything. Lilly is with Thomas in the kitchen groping him. Marlene and Golda tell them to start talking to each other. Jana's daughter asks if they have to be there even when they are not saying anything. Joshua says that the will says that everyone should be present if possible, but the women point out that not everyone is in the room. Zucker grabs his side again like he is having another heart attack. He tries to leave but Marlene will not let him leave. They sit him back down next to Samuel and Marlene tells everyone that her family is a mess. She reveals that they live separate lives, that their children want nothing to do with him, and that she was planning on divorcing him before the telegram came. She said that she thought it was a sign from God. She thought he would change if Samuel and Zucker made up, but no. Zucker has done nothing but lie to all of them. She says that he wants the inheritance but refuses to give up his shady dealings. Zucker starts talking about his ""shady dealings."" He tells everyone that all he can do to make money is play pool. He says that this week his dream tournament has come to berlin. He says that he was going to pay off everything with the 100,000 euro prize money on monday to keep him out of jail. He says that he lost his chance because yesterday he was late to his game and he was forfeited. But he says he still has one more chance to win. The winner o tournament wants to have a private game with him. Marlene does not want him to do it. Zucker starts to grab his side again and Jana says that he must really be having heart problems. She says that maybe he needs to play to be well. Joshua will not allow Zucker to go play pool. He says that it violate the rules. Samuel says that this is for his health. Joshua says that he should go to the hospital then. Joshua says that he can't let this go on. Before he could claim that they did not know about Zucker but now they know and he cannot be apart of the scam. Joshua leaves to tell the Rabbi everything. Jana chases after him.Jana catches up with him on the street and they begin to talk. Jana says that he does not have to do this, that it is not him at all. Joshua is mad that they are all dancing on his grandmother's grave for her money. Jana says that it is natural that they think of the money because it is a lot of money. Jana says that she sees that Zucker is desperate and even though they have been fighting ever since he destroyed their love, she is on his side. He tells her that she was old enough to decide between her athletic career or him and she made her choice. She stops him before he leaves and says that he ran off and found God and she had their daughter. Joshua faints from the shock. Thomas goes into Zucker's room to ask him where he got the 20,000 euros. Zucker says that he did not get the money. Thomas asks if the Russian was any good and Zucker says yes. Thomas then says that they have decided that he should play to get this problem off his back. Thomas says that he will give him a loan at 11% interest provided that Jana can get Joshua back and tells Zucker to go back to sleep. Later, everyone is at Zucker's club and the game is about to begin. The film shows both of them playing and a man changing the scores every time the get a ball in. the score is very close and the Russian misses his shot and gives Zucker a chance to win. He makes the shot but then falls to the ground. Zucker narrates that this was his last week and for the last 12 hours he has been in a coma. He says that for 12 hours they have been trying to decide whether he won or lost. Zucker says in his sleep, ""New game, new chances... even in death."" Everyone is in the room with him waiting. The Rabbi says that he is not dead when he hears him speak. Everyone walks over to Zucker. The Rabbi apologizes that he took the shivah to heart like he did. Zucker asks what time it is and he is told it is Monday at 12:05. Zucker says that he will go to jail. The Russian comes in with Linda and says, ""unlucky in play, but lucky in love."" He tells Zucker that he technically lost the game because he put both hands on the table, but he does not want to win like that. He offers to to 50/50 with him. He says that he paid off his debt and gave him the remainder of the the money. He goes on to say what a great player Zucker is and how he watched him play over the last few days. The Rabbi looks more and more upset. When the Russian finished, the Rabbi said that he thinks that their mother would want them to forfeit the inheritance. He said he was upset that their mother's last wish was not granted and that the shivah was so grossly violated. He leaves the hospital room.Marlene chases after the Rabbi while Samuel collapses on the ground. Marlene tells the Rabbi that Zucker did every thing he could to observe the shivah and now he has had a real heart attack. She says that he claims to be impartial but stands to benefit from his decision. The Rabbi tells her that he broke the rules by faking his first heart attack and gambling instead of observing Shabbat and lying over and over again. Golda comes out and says that their mother wanted them to make peace with each other. The Rabbi agrees and decides to give them another chance. They hold shivah in their hospital beds. They spend the first two days in silence. Golda sings and Thomas and Lilly go off to a room together and have sex. Afterwards Thomas asks how he was and Lilly says that he was pretty amateurish. Thomas starts to cry and says that it was his first time. Lilly says that he is a little old but Thomas claims that he is a romantic. Back at Zucker's house Jana, Joshua and Sara are talking together. Joshua blurts out that he is her father and Sara says she figured as much. She wonders why Jana had never told her before. They tell her that took so long because it was difficult.The shivah is almost done. Marlene complains that they haven't budged an inch. Zucker says that they are getting along fine. Marlene insists that they start talking to each other. Jana tells him to say what he did to her when he was on drugs. He says, ""I never wrote you off and that I love you."" Golda claps her hands and encourages him to continue on. All of the family then gets up and leaves them along together with the Rabbi.Hours go by and it is night outside. Zucker says, ""I'm sorry"" to Samuel, but he does not believe it. Zucker tells him that Samuel is convinced that there is nothing to set straight on his side. Zucker says that their mother and Samuel left him in East Germany at 14 all alone. Samuel says that he had to go to Frankfurt for surgery on his leg and that Zucker wanted to stay at the sports academy while the wall went up. Samuel claimed that Zucker chose socialism over family. Zucker tells him to forget politics for a while and told him that he never once visited neither did their mother. He says that a little family support would have been nice and not just by giving him money. He asks Samuel to come over to him. Samuel asked why Zucker can't come to him. Zucker replies that he just had a heart attack and Samuel just suffered from a dizzy spell. Samuel gets out of bed and goes over to Zucker. The Rabbi continues to pretend to sleep while Zucker and Samuel awkwardly hug each other while they are connected to lots of tubes. Zucker admits to thinking about the money that he would get from his mother but not solely only partly.When they get out of the hospital and the shivah is over, the whole family goes to the Rabbi's office to find out how much Zucker and Samuel's mother's stocks are worth. Zucker see's his mother in the ceiling dressed up like a fairy with a star shaped wand saying, ""New game, new chances, my dear Jankele."" He laughs to himself. The Rabbi says that he is going to split the money evenly between the community and the two brothers. He says that if he had been strict they would not have gotten anything. He admits that he is curious to see how much the estate is worth as well. He makes a call and gives the account number and they all wait to hear the results. The Rabbi thanks the person on the phone and tells everyone that it is a positive balance but that it did not amount to much. They all start laughing. Zucker said he hoped that the stocks were worth something. He did not think he had a chance but took it anyway, just like they all did. He talks about how there is now a lot of back and forth between Frankfurt and Berlin now. He does not have a lot of time to play pool any more because he spends more time with his family. Monday is Jana's day, Tuesday is Thomas's day, Friday is Marlene's day, and on Sunday he talks one the phone with Samuel. On Wednesdays and Thursdays he goes to the synagogue and reads the Torah. The movie ends with Zucker winning a game of pool with a man in a bar and taking the money and leaving. The man stands there for a second before chasing after Zucker."

"Nova Robotics in Damon, Washington, has developed a new line of laser weapon-equipped robots called Strategic Artificially Intelligent Nuclear Transport (SAINT), which have tank-like tracks for movement. At a cost of $11 million each, five robots have been built, each capable of being parachuted into enemy territory and transporting a nuclear bomb into position. SAINT inventor Newton Crosby (Steve Guttenburg) envisioned the robots for non-military uses, but the military establishment sees them as the ""ultimate soldier"" that will follow orders without question.After the robots offer an impressive demonstration to military and government officials, a bolt of lightning hits the generator recharging robot Number Five. While Five initially seems to be fine, it quickly starts bumping into walls and malfunctioning. Five accidentally gets onto a garbage truck leaving the Nova Laboratories compound, but then falls off, landing in a pasture. When Nova officials discover Five is missing, Newton Crosby contacts it, but Five signals back, ""Malfunction. Need input."" Nova officials learn Five's whereabouts with a tracking device and send a team to get it. They are worried because Five's laser weapons are still operational. Nova head Howard Marner (Austin Pendleton) pleads they not destroy Five, but Nova's security chief, Chick Skroeder (G.W. Bailey), tells his men to use any means necessary to put it out of commission. Newton and his assistant, Ben Jabituya (Fisher Stevens), also search for the robot.Five maneuvers aimlessly, seeking ""input."" A security tank catches up as Five crosses a bridge over the Columbia River into Oregon. The tank rams Five and pushes it off the bridge. Five releases its parachute and, unbeknownst to the driver, Stephanie Speck (Ally Sheedy), lands on top of a ""Snack Shack"" natural foods truck.At home, Stephanie prepares dinner, but notices strange lights going off inside the truck. She finds Number Five, assumes it is an alien from outer space, and welcomes it to Earth. Five audibly responds, ""Malfunction. Need input."" Stephanie invites Five to come inside, but the robot does not understand. However, when she says, ""forward,"" Five comprehends and goes into the house. Five quickly reads every book she has, delighted to have ""input.""The next morning, Five is able to imitate the commercials and do impressions of the voices it heard on television. When Five accidentally falls off the rear deck of Stephanie's house, she sees its Nova Laboratories nameplate on its underside and realizes Five is a robot rather than an alien. She telephones Nova, saying she has one of their missing robots and asks about a reward. Nova officials say they will be right over, but in the meantime, she should stay away from Five as it is malfunctioning. Stephanie tells Five that help is coming and that it needs a ""tune-up."" Five recites the dictionary definition of ""tune-up,"" which includes the synonym, ""disassemble."" Five sees a grasshopper in the yard and tries to jump like it. However, Five lands atop the grasshopper, squashing it. Five asks her to fix the grasshopper and Stephanie explains death to the robot. Five gets upset realizing that death can also mean ""disassemble."" Panicking, the robot gets in Stephanie's food truck, quickly reads the instruction manual, and drives away. Stephanie jumps onto the truck as it pulls out. Five drives erratically, but Stephanie convinces it to stop just before it drives into the river. When Stephanie asks why Five drove off like that, the robot replies that Nova will disassemble him.When Newton Crosby arrives, Five conveys the message that it is alive and wants to survive. The security team shoots at Five. The robot returns their fire with laser beams, destroying many boats in the marina. Newton gets the security team to stop shooting and powers down the robot. As the security team takes Five away, Newton instructs his assistant, Ben, to go with them and be sure not to erase the robot's memory. However, once in the back of the van, Five powers itself back up and replaces its damaged arm. When Ben and the driver see Five operating again, they panic and abandon the van. Five drives away, removing the tracking device attached to it.That night, Five returns to Stephanie's house while she is taking a bath, insisting it is alive. She agrees to let the robot stay the night and later, the two dance together, Five imitating dance moves it observed while watching the movie Saturday Night Fever. The next morning, Stephanie's former boyfriend, Frank (Brian McNamara), arrives to collect the $25,000 reward for the robot. Five responds by disassembling Frank's Trans Am sports car. When Frank fires his shotgun at Five, the robot deflects the bullets and fires its lasers, chasing Frank away.As Newton Crosby searches for Five, Nova chief Howard Marner radios that Stephanie wants to meet with him. Newton goes to the Black Cat Inn, where Stephanie tries to convince him that Five is alive. Newton responds that the robot can seem lifelike, but it is malfunctioning. As they talk, Stephanie realizes that Nova operatives are in the restaurant, waiting to capture Five.Meanwhile, Five is hiding in the woods nearby when the other SAINT robots try to capture it. Five eludes them, then reprograms them to behave like screen comics The Three Stooges. Five goes to the Black Cat Inn and rescues Stephanie from the Nova security team. They drive away together, while the security team chases. They elude their pursuers, then return to the Black Cat Inn where Five kidnaps Newton Crosby. Five insists it is alive and refuses to allow Newton to reprogram it or even look at its wiring. Five says that it is wrong to kill or disassemble. Newton asks how Five knows that and performs various tests on Five, including a Rorschach test. As Five offers human-like responses, Newton is slowly swayed. Finally, when the scientist tells a joke, Five responds with laughter. Newton says that is a spontaneous emotional response and he is finally convinced the robot is alive.Nova security men arrive along with the Army, demanding the robot. They capture Newton and Stephanie, but Five hides in the van. As the men approach, Five dashes out the back and races across the desert. The Army shoots at the robot and a helicopter fires a bazooka at it, destroying it. Devastated by its ""death,"" Stephanie collapses and Newton tries to comfort her. Howard Marner is devastated by the loss of the valuable robot and fires both Newton Crosby and the security chief, Skroeder.As Stephanie and Newton drive away, Five climbs from beneath the flooring in back, explaining that it quickly assembled a duplicate robot out of spare parts in the back of van. Newton mentions they can hide out on the 40 acres of land he owns in Montana. Five takes the steering wheel and announces it wants a new name, suggesting ""Johnny Five"" would be good."

Miller must keep his room and hide the cast and crew until the meeting with the backer can take place.At the same time, a troubleshooter for the hotel chain, Gregory Wagner (Donald MacBride) discovers the debt. Assured by hotel manager Joe Gribble (Cliff Dunstan), who happens to be Miller's brother-in-law, that Miller had skipped, Wagner is surprised to find Miller still in his room, now joined by the play's author, Leo Davis (Frank Albertson), who has arrived in town and checked into Miller's room.When Wagner threatens to evict Miller before the backer can arrive, Miller and Binelli convince Davis to pretend to be sick.

The agent just wants to escape the madness, but reluctantly signs over the check, and leaves.Davis returns and says he heard the agent saying he'll cancel the check, and just signed it to get out of the room. Wagner is fooled into believing all is okay, and upgrades the boys to a fancier room. Later, as the play is about to open, the check from Fisk bounces, Miller, Binelli, and Faker manipulate Wagner into believing he's driven the play's author to take poison. They pretend to give Davis large quantities of Ipecac which is actually drank by Faker, who eventually pretends to die. Wagner is bluffed into believing it's all his fault and helps take the ""body"" down to the alley. As Miller and Wagner prop Faker on a crate, a passing policeman asks what's going on. Miller bluffs their way out of the situation, so he and Wagner make an escape, leaving Faker ""asleep"".They go to watch the end of the play, which is a scene where the miners are bringing a body from out of the mine. The body on the stretcher is Faker's. Wagner realizes he's been duped as the play is greeted with thunderous applause and a revived Davis appears next to Wagner at the back of the theater."

Sophie is planning to marry her fiance Sky (Dominic Cooper)and wants her father to be present to ""give her away,"" but does not know who he is. After reading Donna's diary from 20 years ago, she concludes he is one of three men: Sam Carmichael (Pierce Brosnan), Harry Bright (Colin Firth), or Bill Anderson (Stellan Skarsgård). Without telling her mother and fiancé, Sophie mails invitations to all three (""I Have a Dream""), and hopes to find out which is her father. Sophie tells her two best friends, Ali (Ashley Lilley) and Lisa (Rachel McDowall) about her potential fathers (""Honey, Honey""). All three men come to the island, thinking Donna asked them to come, and Sophie hides them upstairs in the old goat house,getting them to agree not to reveal she wrote to them pretending to be her mother Donna. Other guests have also arrived from the harbor:Donna's longtime friends, single,fun-loving writer Rosie (Julie Walters) and rich three-time divorcée Tanya (Christine Baranski).While Donna is making repairs to the hotel she cannot afford (Money, Money, Money), there is a tremor and the dolphin mosaic in the courtyard floor splits. Donna hunts flooring supplies in the goat house, hears noises upstairs, and peers inside the trap door and window. Recognizing the men she had dated,Donna panics,but tries to take another peek at them(Mamma Mia), but cannot get inside the locked room. Finally, she climbs to the rooftop, and then falls through the top door(opened by a member of the Greek chorus whom Donna and the other characters apparently cannot see). Donna, unable to handle the memories, asks the three men to leave the island, so they simply stay in the harbor on Bill's boat. Seeing the three men has sent Donna into shock, her two friends, Tanya and Rosie, try to reassure her (Chiquitita). Donna explains the 3 potential fathers are on the island, and comments, ""it's like a hideous trick of fate,"" when some bystanders instantly laughed. Tanya and Rosie ponder the quiet bystanders, and Rosie mutters, ""It's very Greek"" Tanya and Rosie look at the Greeks then follow Donna into the house (Greek comedy).However, Donna's depression continues, so Tanya and Rosie remind her of her free-spirited past (Dancing Queen) and Donna rebounds; they all sing together and dance through the streets, joined by many women and girls of the town, dancing down to the harbor pier(former ABBA member Benny Andersson appears playing the piano in this scene). Sophie visits the three men on Bill's boat and convinces them to stay for her wedding after hearing all three men's memories of Donna (Our Last Summer). When she hears Sky, she jumps into the sea and swims to him on the beach. There, they discuss their meeting and their love for each other (Lay All Your Love On Me), but Sky is ambushed by his buddies for the bachelor party.That evening, the three women, at a hen party, recreate their old 80's style musical duo, Donna and the Dynamos (Super Trouper) to entertain at the bachelorette guests. The three men come to the party, and the crowd separates, singing and dancing (Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!). Sophie talks to Bill, and he realizes he could be her father. She asks him to give her away at the wedding. The masked guys from Sky's bachelor party invade the hen party in a wild dance (Voulez-Vous). In the commotion, the other two men also conclude that they could be the father, and separately, each tells Sophie that he will be the one to give her away at the wedding. Surrounded by her mother, her fiancé, and all three potential fathers, Sophie faints over her dilemma.To avoid contention between the three men, Sophie instead asks Donna to give her away.

Meanwhile, Tanya rejects the playful advances of Pepper and some of Sky's other friends (Does Your Mother Know).After confessing to Sky that she has invited all three potential fathers, Sky says that he is unsure of what he wants to do about the wedding. Sophie rushes up to Donna and asks her if she will help her prepare for the wedding and she agrees; whilst preparing, they both reminisce about the times before being engaged (Slipping Through My Fingers). Donna, still unaware of Sam's true feelings, and rushing to the hilltop wedding, tells Sam to stop talking to her(The Winner Takes It All). Then Donna runs to the hilltop. Sam is stunned.During the wedding ceremony, Donna finally mentions the ""father"" issue, and the secrets begin unraveling: all three potential fathers publicly claim be Sophie's father and agree to happily take a 'third' each. Sophie and Sky decide to postpone the wedding,as Sky wanted all along,and to take a trip around the world together. Sam proposes to Donna, revealing that after falling for her two decades previously, he had to go back to England to break off his engagement. But when he came back to Kalokairi,one of her friends told her she was off with another man(Bill). He went home and got married anyway. But that was a mistake and he is now divorced. He argues that if they marry right away,the wedding party is not wasted. Donna agrees to marry Sam (I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do). Sam and Donna celebrate with their newfound family and friends (When All Is Said and Done). At the wedding, Harry tells Donna she was the first and last woman he ever loved, infering he is gay and pointedly looks at a local lad.During the after-wedding party, Rosie reveals she is strongly attracted to Bill (Take a Chance on Me) he does not reciprocate at first, but eventually gives in. One issue remains to be resolved: as the crowd dances in the courtyard, the central dolphin mosaic breaks open, in a tremor, and a tall spray rains over the party.Donna concludes it was Aphrodite,the Greek goddess of love,influencing events all along. The closing scene of the film shows Sophie and Sky sailing to the horizon to begin their life together, leaving Sam and Donna to live happily ever after on the island (""I Have a Dream"").After the closing scene, Donna and the Dynamos perform ""Dancing Queen"" over the credits.

"Anthony, nicknamed Tick, is a Sydney-based drag queen who performs under the name Mitzi. After he gets hired to perform at a resort in Alice Springs, he invites two people along both for company and to be part of the show. They are fellow drag queen Adam, who performs under the name Felicia, and middle aged transsexual Bernadette, who was born male with the name Ralph, and whose much younger husband has just passed away. Tick believes this trip will be be a distraction for Bernadette, a former ""Les Girls"" in ""his"" younger days. This threesome is not a totally cohesive group, with overly boisterous Adam/Felicia being the one who will probably get on the others' nerves, he only being invited because Felicia does add an extra something to the stage. Adam largely uses his trans status to guilt his mother for money, which is how he is able to buy the highway coach that he names Priscilla, in which the three will travel to Alice Springs. They get into one misadventure after another based on their queer fish out of water status in many of the small outback towns through which they travel, those misadventures for which they not only need to provide support for each other in every sense of the word, but also solidarity. But perhaps more importantly, they help each other with the issues they are facing in their personal lives, Tick's biggest which are currently waiting for him in Alice Springs.::Huggo"

"As a surprise birthday present for his father, Josh has made an online purchase of a second-hand, overstuffed burgundy recliner, exactly like the one his father had when Josh was growing up. As children, Josh and his younger brother Rhett affectionately referred to that recliner as the puffy chair. Josh's initial plan is for he and his band mates to drive from New York, where Josh lives, to pick up the chair from the second-hand furniture store in Millbridge where he bought it, before driving to his parents' house in Atlanta, his parents who also have no idea that Josh is coming for the birthday. Due to circumstances and to make it up to her for an argument they had the night before the departure, Josh instead makes the trip with his girlfriend Emily, who sees the invitation as an unexpected romantic gesture from usually unromantic Josh. As it becomes more a family trip, Josh decides to make a short stop in Virginia to say hello to Rhett, who Emily has never met. That stop results in Rhett deciding to make the trip with them the rest of the way so that the brothers can celebrate their father's birthday as a family. The trio get into one misadventure after another based partly on circumstances and partly on the different priorities each has for this trip. Unsentimental Josh, who generally does sweat the small stuff, just wants to make it to Millbridge then Atlanta with little fuss but more importantly on his terms. Emily just wants to spend quality time with Josh, who she hopes one day to marry despite Josh's unspoken and seeming phobia to commitment. And free-spirited and irresponsible Rhett, who believes in general aura as an overriding factor, wants to do whatever makes him happiest at any given time.

Winnie finds out that Britney's cheering with the Warriors and reveals this to her friends.

Camille and Jesse arrive at Britney's to offer their condolences, and when they see Britney and Brad dressed up for the dance, Camille kicks her off the squad.At the dance, Winnie reveals to everyone that she has been sleeping with Brad behind Britney's back and Britney dumps Brad on the spot, telling Winnie that she's ""too much of a backstabber to have any real friends"". The next day, which is the day of the auditions, Britney arrives at the Warriors' bus and comes to wish them good luck. When Winnie, with the rest of her team, makes fun of the Warriors, Britney stands up to Winnie and defends them. Camille, impressed by this, lets Britney cheer with them again.

Winnie protests, dismissing CH's style as ""ghetto,"" to which Rihanna responds that she judges a squad by their skills and not by where they come from.

Hes watching Access Hollywood and they are recapping his five year relationship with Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell) an actress who plays in a CSI type TV show. He writes the music for the show and they look really happy together. Following that is a music video starring Aldous Snow (Russell Brand). He's a British hippy-free-love type singer and is apparently considered very cool.The phone rings and it's Sarah calling to say she's on her way home. He quickly jumps up and starts to clean. He throws a bunch of stuff in the closet and then hops in the shower. He comes out of the shower in nothing but a towel. Sarah is standing there and says something along the lines of we need to talk. Peter drops his towel and the audience is given a full view of Jason Segel's front side. Actually, pretty much this whole scene is Jason Segel walking around naked. Peter is upset and asks if there is someone else. Sarah says no. Peter says they should just hold each other like they used to and she would love him again. They hug even though he's naked and it's incredibly awkward. Sarah finally admits that there is someone else and walks away.Peter meets his step brother Brian (Bill Hader) at the bar. Brian thinks Peter needs to get over it. Peter thinks he just needs to sleep with someone since Sarah is already sleeping with someone so Brian agrees to help him meet some women. Peter ends up going home with one of the women. He starts crying afterwards when he has flashbacks of all he good times he had with Sarah.Peter then goes to the doctor because hes paranoid that he may have an STD. The doctor is actually a pediatrician and tells Peter he should sleep with as many women as possible to get over his ex girlfriend. There is then a montage of Peter sleeping with various women.Peter is still distraught and can't work. His brother Brian comes over to his house and it's a complete dump. Peter is trying to burn all the pictures he has of Sarah because she's everywhere and he can't get over her. Brian tells Peter that Sarah was always kind of a bitch to him and his wife. Peter gets mad and says that Sarah is better than Brian's wife. Brian gets really mad and says that his wife is carrying his unborn child and that Peter is not even blood since they're step siblings. Brian says that Peter should get away somewhere. Peter says that Sarah used to talk about this place in Hawaii that was really beautiful. Brian doesn't think that's a good idea but Peter says he's going.Peter gets to Hawaii and goes to the hotel. There is a newly married couple in front of him Darald and Wyoma (Jack McBrayer and Maria Thayer). The couple leave and Peter is greeted at the front desk by Rachel Jansen (Mila Kunis). He says he doesn't have reservations but he thought he'd try his luck. She says that the only room available is the nicest suite in the house which costs $6,000 a night. He says he can't afford it, but just then he notices Sarah walking towards him. Rachel says that Sarah and her new boyfriend are staying there and that everyone is really excited. Peter tells Rachel that he and Sarah just broke up three weeks ago and he came here to get over her. Sarah walks up followed by her new boyfriend Aldous Snow and wants to know if Peter is following her and if he's staying there. He says that of course he isn't following her. Hes about to say that he's not staying there but then Rachel says that he's been booked for four nights into the expensive quite. Sarah looks put out and walks off. Peter tells Rachel thank you for saving his face but that he still can't afford it. She says he can stay there for free as long as he cleans up after himself since no one uses that suite but Oprah.Peter calls Brian and Brian tells him to stop following Sarah and go to another hotel. Peter doesn't want to because it will look like he's running way. The audience sees that he continues to follow Sarah and Aldous to their room which is at ground level. Sarah and Aldous start to make out but Peter clears his throat to get their attention and then walks on up to his room. He tells Brian that he's sure that he ruined Sarah's day. The next scene is Sarah and Aldous having sex in many different positions. Clearly Sarah's day has not been ruined.Peter on the other hand is upstairs watching her TV show and crying like a baby. Rachel from the front desk calls and says that there are reports of a woman crying loudly. Peter denies that it's him but the next scene is him curled in the fetal position on the floor crying loudly.Peter goes to dinner at the restaurant and the host Matthew (Jonah Hill) makes him feel uncomfortable because he's there by himself. Then he seats Peter at the table across from Sarah and Aldous. Aldous invites Peter to join them. Peter says no but offers to buy them drinks. Aldous says that he is seven years sober and clean (he used to be an intravenous drug user) and shows seven bar tattoos on his neck that prove it. At the table behind Peter, a couple gets engaged. Peter leaves the table. Sarah comes after him and asks again if he followed her to Hawaii. He again denies it and thanks her for dating Aldous after him since Aldous probably shared needles. She asks how long he is staying. She is clearly unhappy. He tells her he's happy there and that he'll probably stay for a while.Peter gets drunk at the bar and is joined by Darald. We learn through flashbacks that he and his new wife are having difficulties in bed. The next morning Peter goes to breakfast and orders pineapple juice with Rum which the waiter brings him. He decides he's going to try surfing and goes to find Chuck (Paul Rudd). Chuck agrees to teach him how to surf and also offers him weed which Peter says no to. Chuck tells Peter that when life gives you lemons, you just have to throw the lemons out. Peter does not learn how to surf. Peter goes back to his room and talks to Brian through a webcam. Brian tells him he just needs to meet more people. Chuck thinks the people are weird but thinks he might ask Rachel out. Brian thinks it's a bad idea but his wife thinks it's a good idea.Its the fourth of July picnic and Peter sees Rachel greeting customers. He's about to ask her out but loses his nerve. He goes to sit down and Matthew tries to take his plate because he's seated by himself. There is a band playing but Matthew gets up on stage and asks Aldous to come up and play a song for everyone. Aldous agrees and comes up and sings a very sexual song for Sarah. Peter walks off towards the beach and talks to a guy who was serving food at the buffet that morning. (we'll call him Buffet Guy or BG for short) BG tells Peter he needs to stop telling people that he and Sarah broke up. He offers to let Peter help him prepare the pig for the luau that evening. Peter thinks he's talking about cooking the pig but Peter ends up having to help wrangle and then stab the pig. At the luau Peter finally asks Rachel out. She just wants to hang out as friends at beach party that evening.At the beach, Rachel tells Peter that she was with this guy for two years and quit school and moved out here for him. Two weeks later she discovered him cheating on her. But she's happy where she is and doesn't want to go back to school. Peter admits that he hates writing for the TV show and really wants to finish his rock opera about Dracula made for puppets. Just then, Rachel's ex shows up and she tells Peter when she tells him to run, he should run. She gets up and wants to fight her boyfriend. BG steps in and ends up clocking the boyfriend while Peter drags Rachel off. Peter and Rachel go to a bar where a band is playing. Rachel says that she wants to go to the bathroom or get a drink (or something) and Peter offers to hold her purse. She says she's not that kind of girl. He has a flashback of all the times Sarah made him hold her purse and stand in the background while she took pictures.Peter goes to the bathroom and there is a bunch of pictures of girls flashing including one of Rachel. Peter tells Rachel about it and she says she knows but that her boyfriend made her do it and now the owner of the bar won't give it back. He offers to take it but she says the owner would kill him. Just then, the band announces they're taking a break but that Peter is going to come up and play a piece from his puppet/Dracula/rock opera. He plays the song and sings like Dracula. Rachel thinks it's great and half the people like it, the other half don't seem to get it. Rachel drives him back to the hotel and both agree that they had a nice time. He leans over to kiss her but she moves away because she doesn't want to complicate things.Peter goes up to the bar and Chuck is sitting there with Darald. Chuck doesn't have any idea who Peter is any more. Peter tells them that he just had a date with Rachel but they pooh pooh the idea and say that's not possible. The bartender says that she's in customer service and that he probably thinks strippers like him too. Darald's wife comes down and drags him back to their bed.The next day, Sarah and Aldous are in their room when Sarah gets a phone call. She finds out that her show has been cancelled and she's somewhat upset. She tells Aldous and he's happy because he thinks she'll go on tour with him now. She gets upset because he had not told her he was going on an 18 month tour of Europe and he's leaving in two weeks. She tells him she can't go because she's a working actress. He says she's not employed anymore and she can be the head of his groupies. Shes upset that he didn't tell her about the tour and he adds that he didn't tell her that he has genital herpes because hes not having an outbreak.Peter sees Sarah sitting alone at the bar. She tells him about the show and he asks her if she's doing okay. She says yes but he tells her to cut the bull because shes not on The View. She tells him she's upset about it and doesn't want to fade out of sight. He makes some jokes and cheers her up. He has a flashback to him singing his rock opera song to her and she tells him that she doesn't get it.Later, Peter goes up to Rachel and she asks him if he wants to hang out again that afternoon. He says he wants to go for a hike and asks her to come. She agrees but as they're leaving they run into the bartender who's dressed in a wetsuit, he wants Peter to go snorkelling with him but Rachel drags him off laughing towards the trail. Sarah witnesses this and looks thoughtful.Peter and Rachel walk up to top of a cliff that overlooks the bay. He talks about the fact that they are similar because they've both been hurt. They feel impervious to pain. Like they could just jump off the cliff into the water and not get hurt. Rachel says they should just do it. Peter thinks this is a metaphor for them kissing and leans in to kiss Rachel as she jumps off the cliff into the water. She tells him he should jump too. He tries to jump but ends up half falling and almost killing himself. He eventually lets go and is not hurt. Rachel kisses him.Sarah goes up to Rachel at the front desk and asks if there's a good Sushi place around there. She tells Rachel she saw Rachel and Peter together and that Peter is really great guy. Sarah tells Rachel that she's really pretty and then starts to cry.The next day Peter wakes up and BG is standing over him (another naked shot of Jason Segel). Dakota Fanning needs the suite so Peter is going to have to move to a different room. The next shot is him in the patio next door to Sarah. He tells her it was the only room available.Darald asks Aldous how he can please his wife. Aldous shows Darald how to have sex with his wife using giant chess pieces out on the beach.Meanwhile Peter goes up to Chuck and tells him hes ready to surf. Chuck gives him the board and he paddles out into the water. Aldous is out there and they talk about the song Peter is writing. Aldous likes it. They talk about Sarah and Peter mentions they were together for five years. Aldous says that Peter has four years on him meaning that Aldous and Sarah were having sex for a year before she broke things off with Peter. Peter is royally angry and tells Aldous to get out of there. Peter finally is able to get on his surfboard when a wave comes up but he surfs right over Aldous and knocks him off his board. Peter pulls Aldous out of the water and Aldous is yelling that his leg hurts. There is a piece of coral in his leg which Peter pulls out. As soon as he does, the wound starts gushing blood which causes Peter to faint.Peter wakes up in Sarah's room and she is sitting beside him. She did not want him to wake up by himself. He confronts her about her cheating on him and starts to storm out. She asks him to stay and talk to her and he does. She tells him that she tried really hard, but that she couldn't get him to come out of his shell. That he spent an entire week in sweat pants (funny montage of Peter in the same pair of sweat pants doing different things). She says she talked to a therapist, read books, and talked to her mom to try to help him, but she couldn't pull him out of his house. He storms off around the corner to his patio.That evening Sarah and Aldous are getting dressed for dinner. Aldous comes out in a sheer black shirt. Sarah wonders why he's not wearing the shirt she bought for him. He clearly does not want to wear it and Sarah remembers all the times she bought tacky clothes for Peter to wear and he wore them proudly because she had given them to him. The next scene is Aldous wearing a very tacky Hawaiian shirt that Sarah apparently bought for him and the two of them are walking towards the restaurant. He's upset about having to wear the shirt.As they walk up, Peter and Rachel are standing in line in front of them. The host Matthew just gave the last table to Rachel and Peter and is very upset that he has to tell his idol Aldous that he'll have to wait five minutes for a table. Peter offers to let them sit with them which Sarah promptly accepts. Peter tells Rachel that he's sorry, he didn't think they would say yes. Rachel did think Sarah would say yes. Neither Rachel nor Aldous are very happy.Dinner is awkward although there is a really funny scene where they make fun of a movie Sarah made about cell phones that kill people (Kristen Bell starred in a movie called Tone which was about cell phones that killed people it didn't do very well at the box office). Everyone (except Aldous) is drinking way too much wine. Aldous tells the table that his theory of life is that you should have sex with as many people as possible as much as possible. Peter disagrees. Sarah is very upset at this point and takes it out on Rachel by saying something bitchy. Rachel responds with something equally bitchy and then leans over and kisses Peter. Sarah is not happy. There is also a montage during this scene of Darald and his wife having sex in many different positions and clearly enjoying it.The next scene is Peter and Rachel making out in his room. He tells her she's too drunk but she wants to have sex anyway. They start to have sex and Sarah hears them in the next room. She wakes up Aldous so that he'll have sex with her. She fakes an orgasm and yells really loud. Peter yells back while he and Rachel have sex.Aldous pushes Sarah off of him and is very offended that she faked an orgasm with him. He says she isn't over Peter and that he's going to leave. Sarah gets mad and tells him that all of his tattoos are stupid and he responds by telling her that he had sex with their housekeeper.Peter and Rachel wake up and agree that they really like spending time together. Peter then has a really fun day. He doesn't have anything to drink and is the life of the party at the pool. He runs into Aldous in the lobby and Aldous tells him that he and Sarah broke up. Aldous thinks Peter wants Sarah back but Peter doesn't think that he does.Peter goes to Sarah's room to see how she's doing. She starts to cry and tells him she wants him back. She tries to kiss but he tells her no. Finally she says that she's really sorry so he starts to kiss her back. They try to have sex, but he's not turned on by her anymore. She even tries to give him a blow job, but it doesn't work.Peter goes and tells Rachel what he did and she's incredibly hurt. She tells him not contact her ever again. Peter goes to the bar and takes the picture of her out of the bathroom. The bartender comes in and beats the tar out of him but he keeps the picture.

"This movie follows a day in the life of 2 Dublin Heroin addicts, Adam and Paul. Adam is the taller and slightly smarter of the two while Paul is his sidekick.
Since they were small boys, Adam and Paul have withered into two hopeless, desperate Dublin junkies, tied together by habit and necessity. A stylized, downbeat comedy, the film follows the pair through a single day, which, like every other, is entirely devoted to the business of scrounging and robbing money for drugs.The difference today is that Adam and Paul already near rock bottom have finally run out of luck, credit and friends.Stylistically, Adam & Paul is a cold, contemporary take on classic, physical comedy. Thematically, it is a minimal, Beckettesque fairytale about two baffled, vulnerable children in the grip of forces too powerful for them to handle; vulnerable, lost, sometimes pathetically optimistic, but always profoundly damaged. Adam & Paul is not a film without hope; it is a tender, unsentimental and very funny testament to the persistence of the human spirit in even the most damaged and marginal of people.Some of the sequences within the film have been beautifully captured, in particular a scene shot on the Millennium Bridge, which very aptly depicts the mood through its sluggish and dreamy chops between shots. The techniques, used wonderfully, portray one of the very rare moments in the film when Adam and Paul are oblivious to the inevitability of their fate, blissfully happy in their drug-induced state.So what of 'Adam and Paul'? Well, it is too funny to be depressing, too bleak to be great, yet deeply touching in its handling of the subject matter, and on that account worth watching.You'll never look at Dublin in the same light again."

Don's ex-wife and Tracy's mother Paula (Suzanne Pleshette), tells Don to have Tracy back at a regular time.As father and daughter eat Chinese food, Don complains about the plot from a science-fiction movie they saw, but Tracy talks about the importance of believing in supernatural things. As Don leaves to make a phone call, Tracy opens a fortune cookie that reads: "" Meet me in the lounge. - God."" A second fortune cookie says, ""I mean you, Tracy. - God.""In the lounge, a man's voice beckons her through a red lacquer door, introduces himself as God, and asks for help. At first, Tracy thinks her father is playing tricks, but when other people cannot hear God's voice, she is convinced. God also says he was impressed when she talked about the importance of believing things that cannot be seen. Then, the voice goes silent.On the ride home, Tracy says she had a daydream although vague on the details, but Don, an advertising art director, assures her that it happens to people all the time. He then leaves her in the parked car while retrieving work from his office. This time, God appears in the backseat as an elderly man (George Burns) wearing a gray jacket, black-rimmed glasses, and a red shirt. When Tracy said she expected a deity to wear a crown and a flowing robe, God tells her she has confused him with the actor Charlton Heston. God complains that people do not believe in him anymore, so Tracy suggests that he needs an advertising slogan to spread his message. He asks her to create one that children will understand. Later, Don gives Tracy some pointers on ways to devise a slogan.Back at home, Tracy asks Rosa (Alma Beltran), the housekeeper, if she talks to God. Rosa admits to praying everyday, but says that Tracy's imagination is running wild when Tracy confesses to her experience with God. Later, Tracy tells Shingo about her adventure with God, but he does not believe her either. When Tracy angrily throws a basketball at the hoop and makes a perfect shot, Shingo wonders if she is telling the truth.At school, Tracy's teacher, Miss Hudson, accuses her of being inattentive in class and not turning in her homework, but Tracy is unable to explain her lack of interest. Back at home, Tracy studies television commercials obsessively, trying to figure out an appropriate slogan for God. As she watches The Johnny Carson Show, God appears on the television, and then, suddenly materializes in Tracy's living room. After listening to Tracy's material, God gives the girl another week to create a winning slogan. He encourages her to bounce ideas off of Shingo, with whom she and he eventually come up with ""Think God.""At a local McDonalds the next day, Tracy presents the slogan to God, he tells her the next step is to spread the word. Tracy is worried that the extra responsibility will make her fall farther behind in her schoolwork, but God is persuasive. Tracy rallies her schoolmates, who post signs and leave chalk messages all over town. However, Paula Richards confronts her daughter after receiving a letter from Miss Hudson. When Tracy explains that God has visited her, Paula does not believe her. Tracy is pressured to catch up on her schoolwork, while Shingo enlists his cousins to help spread the word.Later, Tracy complains to God that spreading his slogan has gotten her in trouble with both her parents and friends, and he soothes her by finishing her math homework.Another time later, Don and Paula question their daughter, but Tracy sticks to her story about God. Don wants Tracy to see a psychiatrist or a minister, but Paula wants to handle Tracy's situation by herself without outside interference. The parents decide to watch Tracy's behavior for a few more days.Back at school, the principal, Mr. Benson, arranges a meeting with the Richards because Tracy refuses to stop her God campaign. When Paula tells her daughter that she will be expelled from school if she continues, Tracy says she will stop on the condition that God agrees to the plan. When the school psychologist learns that Tracy's relationship with God started in a Chinese restaurant with a fortune cookie, the principal suspends Tracy and the psychologist tells the parents their daughter needs professional help.Meanwhile, Tracy's school friends picket in front of the school for Tracy's return. Soon, Don and Paula take Tracy to see Dr. Jerome Newell (Anthony Holland) who examines Tracy and puts her through a series of psychosis tests. After the tests are done, Dr. Newell tells Don and Paula that he theorizes (wrongly) that Tracy has created a ""fantasy father figure"" as a substitute for her real father, whom she sees on a limited basis since her parents' divorce. Dr. Newell concludes that there is nothing medically wrong with Tracy, but she is suffering from a psychosis. He suggests that she enter a mental treatment facility in Santa Barbara, California. Before Tracy is taken away to be admitted, she searches for God in several churches and even a synagogue, but cannot find him.Tracy decides to run away, and Shingo helps her hide at his grandparents' house. Later, Tracy runs away to Union Train Station after Shingo warns her that he had to reveal her whereabouts when Don confronted and threatened him. There, God finally appears and convinces Tracy that running away is not the answer, and drives her home in a motorcycle sidecar. Two policemen see the motorcycle (with no one riding it) and chase after it, but God manages to loose the policemen. When Tracy's parents find their daughter in bed, Tracy explains that God brought her home.Meanwhile, the news reports that Tracy's slogan has spread internationally. In court, a judge asks that a panel of psychiatrists convene to determine Tracy's mental health. Based on their findings, the judge says he will rule on whether or not Tracy goes back to school. As the doctors' panel rules that Tracy can start treatment, God arrives and introduces himself as Dr. Stevens, a psychiatrist. Demonstrating his supernatural power, God makes a chandelier disappear and reappear, and turns day into night. He then turns to leave and vanishes; only the door opens and closes by itself. The panel is left speechless, so the Richards take their daughter home.Tracy and her family celebrate at the Chinese restaurant. Tracy receives a message from the fortune cookies and goes to the lounge. There, God thanks her and her friends for their wonderful campaign. Although Tracy is sad she may never see God again, he promises to call on her if he needs help with a big problem."

"Mama's Family originated with Thelma ""Mama"" Harper, and her younger sister Fran living together in Mama's House."
"Thelma Harper and her spinster sister Fran open their home to Thelma's recently divorced son Vinton and his teenage son and daughter. It's quite an adjustment for everyone, especially the cranky, argumentative Thelma.::Kevin Ackley <kackley1@aol.com>"
"Spun off from a Carol Burnett sketch, Mama's Family originated with Thelma ""Mama"" Harper, and her younger sister Fran living together in Mama's House. Mama's youngest son Vinton moved in with his two teenage kids, Buzz and Sonja on the first episode, despite Fran's unwillingness. A few episodes later, Vint married their neighbor, Naomi Oates. Mama had two daughters as well. Ellen, the oldest, tries to be proper and thinks she's rich unlike the family, but tends to rub their cons in their faces. She can be very snobby at times, and has no trouble with being a show off. The other, Eunice, the middle child, a massive drama queen, gets upset about a lot and absolutely hates Ellen, and is very jealous of her. She is married to Ed Higgins, not the most successful guy in the world, and Eunice lets him know every chance she gets. The show was temporarily canceled in 1984, being kicked off of NBC's line up. In 1986, it was brought back in first-run syndication wherein they dropped Buzz, Sonja, Fran, Eunice, Ed, and eventually, Ellen. Buzz and Sonja presumably graduating from High School, and living their own lives, Fran having choked to death on a toothpick in the bathroom of the Bigger Jigger, Ellen appeared in an early Season 3 episode, and her absence was never explained, to my knowledge, and Eunice and Ed moved to Florida, leaving Mama, Vint and Naomi with their delinquent son, Bubba. And also introduced, was their other neighbor, Iola Boylen, living (practically) alone, besides her mother, who has basically shut her self off from the world, leaving Iola to her. She makes all sorts of unique and strange handicrafts that Mama thinks little of, and she tries to keep her cool as much as possible, but occasionally loses it, proving to be very funny. The show was in first-run syndication until 1990, when they ended the show with Vint and Naomi having a baby.::Matthew Blumenstein corrected by JS"
"Thelma Harper, a cranky, sharp-tongued widow shared a small house with her high-strung sister Fran. Thelma's scatterbrained son Vinton moved back in with Thelma with his teenage kids, Sonja and Vinton, Jr. (""Buzz""), after his wife ran out on him to become a Las Vegas showgirl. After Vinton moved in with Thelma, he became romantically interested in Thelma's next-door neighbor Naomi. They soon got married and Naomi moved into Thelma's house as well. Thelma's daughters, the spoiled, rich, snobbish Ellen and the foulmouthed Eunice, and Eunice's husband Ed occasionally visited (Ellen's husband, Bruce, was talked about but never seen). In 1986, Fran died, Buzz and Sonja moved out, and Ed and Eunice moved to Florida. Bubba, Ed and Eunice's son, had served a term in juvenile hall for car theft and because of this, was not allowed to come to Florida to join them; he ended up living with Thelma. Iola (who lived across the street from Thelma her whole life but did not join the cast until 1986) was the looney neighbor who lusted for Vinton.::Anonymous"

Joe hosts a local children's TV program with emphasis on manners and integrity.While they are driving, a runaway teenage girl who says she is named Harmony Starr (Noelle Parker) joins Ernest and Santa in the cab. When they get to their destination, Santa possesses no legal currency (only play money), so in his giving Christmas spirit, Ernest lets him ride for free. The decision gets Ernest fired from his job. Ernest later discovers that Santa left his magic sack in the cab, and Ernest begins a quest to find the old man and return it to him.At the Orlando Children's Museum, Santa tries talking to Joe, but is rudely interrupted and rebuffed by Joe's agent Marty Brock.

Santa tries to explain his predicament, but Joe does not believe him and Marty has Santa arrested.Ernest poses as an employee of the governor with Harmony as the governor's niece, and the two help Santa escape from jail by convincing the police chief that Santa must be taken to an insane asylum. Santa explains to Ernest and Harmony that he was handed down the job of Santa Claus in 1889 and has enjoyed it ever since, but the magic grows weaker over time. The only way to restore its full strength is to pass it on to someone else which is why he must find Joe and make him the new Santa Claus by 7:00 pm.Ernest disguises himself as a snake rancher so he can sneak Santa into a movie studio. Marty presses Joe to quit his children's job and instead land a part in a horror film titled Christmas Slay, about an alien which terrorizes children on Christmas Eve, which offends Santa so deeply he punches the director.Santa later tracks down Joe at his home. He explains about passing the position of Santa Claus over to him because otherwise the magic will eventually die. Santa also explains that from Orlando, Joe must leave to deliver the presents by 7pm; if he leaves any later, he will run into daylight before he finishes. Joe declines, but later is overcome by conscience when the film director wants him to use foul language, which he refuses to say in front of the children on the set.Ernest and Harmony (whose real name is later revealed by Santa to be Pamela Trenton) discover the magic power of Santa's sack, and Pamela starts to abuse it. She steals the sack, and attempts to run away again. On Christmas Eve, however, her conscience prevails, and she rushes back to find Ernest and Santa and return the sack. Ernest meets Santa's elves at the airport and they retrieve the reindeer and sleigh from the holding dock. Because they are short on time, Ernest decides to fly the sleigh to the children's museum, much to the helpers' objection.

Santa, very pleased, transforms Joe into the new Santa Claus. Ernest and the helpers arrive at the museum at 6:58. Pamela has called her mother and has decided to come home.

However, the computer finds another unstable red-dwarf planet, so they have to go and check it out.Francis Boiler (Cal Kuniholm) puts on some country music on the radio. On the ship's log, we can hear that a part of the ship self-distructed. They are dancing to the sound of funky music. The computer tells about something on collision course, and the defence system was destroyed some time ago, so they try to do something manually. A thunder activates a bomb.

One of them makes music with empty bottles of liquor.Talby should be watching the ship, but he's always sleeping. He is advised to see the rest of the ship. He says that space can be wonderful and full of colour, and Doolittle says that he misses Earth and Mars as well. Francis Boiler starts shooting a square of metal just to distract himself, although Pinback tells him not to do it. The computer tells Pinback about the alien going awry, telling him that it was his original idea to bring him into the ship.The alien (Nick Castle) is a beach ball with legs. It doesn't want to eat. Pinback brought it in because he thought it was fine. Pinback is cleaning up the alien's mess when it attacks him. The alien leaves the room. Pinback gives it a plastic toy, and it eats it, but when Pinback goes to pick the broom, the alien is not there. It holds the broom and hits Pinback with it. Pinback looks for the alien in the bowels of the ship. Pinback uses a plank to go to the alien. A sign says ""Emergency air lock interior room"". The alien goes around Pinback and takes the plank away. He tries to cross the shaft, although the corridor is very narrow. It is the lift shaft, and the computer says that it's been activated. Pinback tries to move on towards the alien, but it attacks him. He falls down, but can hold onto the thin layer of passway. The alien jump and tickles Pinback. The lift seems to stop when Pinback interrupts it. The lift goes up again, with Pinback holding onto an outer metalic handle. The alien turns onthe laser, which makes all the systems go crazy.Meanwhile, Doolittle and Talby have kept on talking. Bomb 20 has received a signal to ignate itself again. The computer tries to reason with it, saying that it was an error again. Bomb 20 finally agrees, but it says that that was going to be the last time.The lift stops at the third floor, and Pinback thinks of jumping out. He unscrews a floor trap and gets onto the lift. He gets stuck. He tries to use the phone for help, but it's out of order. He presses another button, and opera music resounds. The lift keeps going up and down for no apparent reason. He presses another button to clean the lift, and presses 1, which will make the lift clean itself.Finally Pinback leaves the lift amid a mist of smoke and with a metalic lid around his waist. Now, at this moment, he's really pissed off, so he goes to pick and anesthetic gun. Soon enough, he finds the alien, cornered somewhere. He shoots the alien, who flies all over the place, and ends up deinflated.Pinback talks about his ordeal to the rest of the crew. They have lunch togethertalking about Talby being mentally unstable. Talby goes to the computer room, and says to Doolittle that the computer has found the malfunction in the ship.Powell left a message, saying that he doesn't intend to come back to Earth. Pinback checks his past diary logs, stating that nobody recognises his good qualities, and that nobody said ""happy birthday"" to him. The computer has finally found the malfunction: it's the laser. However, everybody is sound sleeping but for Pinback.Eventually, they find the unstable planet. Bomb 20 is deployed. Pinback is in the emergency air lock, where there is a door which can be opened without depressureization. There, there is the laser who works badly. Nobody wants to hear Pinback, because they are busy with the deployment of Bomb 20. The laser is turned on, and it shoots inside the ship. The laser makes Pinback blind, and he crosses the path of the laserbeams. This creates further malfunctions, so they can't drop the bomb. Everybody panics on the bridge because the explosion sequence goes on, and Bomb 20 refuses to turn itself off.The computer will only contain the damage done to the ship by Bomb 20 up to a certain degree. They have to ask Powell, in the cryogenic deep-freeze compartment, what could be done. Powell asks about the Dodgers, and complains that he's lonely. When he is about to give a suggestion, the mike has a malfunction, and then Powells forgets about it. Pinback tries to reason with Bomb 20 while Doolittle questions Powell. Doolittle goes out to space and talks to Bomb 20.DOOLITTLE: How do you know that you exist.BOMB 20: Intuition.DOOLITTLE: You can't base everything on intuition.BOMB 20: I think, therefore I am.and the dialogue goes on and on like that. Bomb 20 agrees that its experience of the outer world depends on possibly wrong information. It says that it'd be nice to keep on discussing the matter with Doolittle, but that it has no time, because it will go off in 49 seconds. Meanwhle, Boiler tries to shoot the bomb. In the fight with Pinback, he almost shoots him.Doolittle tells Bomb 20 to consider what his purpose in life is. To explode, of course, says Bomb 20. As it can only explode once, it wouldn't like to explode at the wrong time, would it? Of course not, says Bomb 20, but as it had admitted before that it had no proof that the outer world does exist. 9 seconds, says Bomb 20, and my memory is very good. It has no proof that the orders are either wrong or correct. Bomb 20 goes back inside Dark Space to think futher about the matter.Doolittle tries to rescue Tanby, who was shot out of Dark Space. Now, Bomb 20 thinks that no order coming from the outer world can be reliable, so it explodes itself happily although Pinback tries to reason with it. Tanby and Doolittle are left stranded floating in space.

"Synopsis - The Wax Museum, released 9-6-40
In court, a judge sentences convicted murderer, Steve McBirney, to death at Sing-Sing, who turns to Charlie Chan, threatening him, before the bailiff hauls him away. As the Prosecuting Attorney, congratulates Charlie, shots ring out, Steve McBirney shoots his way out of the courthouse by grabbing a policeman's weapon, firing shots several times, before escaping in a getaway car. McBirney heads to the wax museum, a cover for a gangster hideout, where Dr. Cream escorts McBirney and Grenock, McBirney's henchman, to the surgical room, followed by his assistant, Lily Latimer.Three weeks have passed since the courthouse shootout and Homicide Inspector O'Matthews has Charlie Chan at his desk, talking about McBirney's surprise escape. Enter Jimmy Chan, Mary Bolton, reporter from the Daily Record, Dr. Cream, Cream Crime Museum, Dr. Otto von Brom, psycho-criminalist, formerly from the Berlin Germany police department. They are all hoping Charlie accepts the invitation to attend a radio broadcast, debating the decision of a former crime and execution involving a Mr. Rocke. Mary tries to encourage Chan to attend the challenge and discussion. She shows him a picture of Joe Rocke, Chan claims Rocke was innocent, hanged for a crime he did not commit, the real murderer was never caught. Von Brom disagrees with Charlie's proclamation, stating Joe Rocke was convicted on von Brom's scientific evidence.The Inspector speaks about how people have been arguing for years over whether Joe Rocke fired that poison dart. Von Brum goads Charlie into the possibility he is leery of Steve McBirney's threats. Dr. Cream challenged Charlie Chan, in his absence, while among Jimmy's classmates. Mary Bolton and Dr. Cream went to Jimmy because they did not know how to locate Charlie. Jimmy accepted the invitation for Charlie, when the challenge was presented to the class. Charlie first balks at the invite, then changes his mind, telling Cream, he his most anxious for his own presence at tonight's broadcast. The Inspector said he is surprised at Chan for accepting that phony challenge. Charlie changed his mind because now Dr. Cream's role as a former and famous surgeon has changed to being a known friend of many criminals, like Steve McBirney; Chan is suspicious of Cream.Chan speculates, it is possible McBirney visited the doctor for a perfect disguise. McBirney's former partner, Butcher Degan, purportedly received a new face from Dr. Cream, too. Charlie is convinced Degan is still alive and hiding behind a new face, created by Dr. Cream. Inspector O'Matthews says there was no new face on Degan when they found his body. The severely mutilated body found, thought to be Degan's, was likely another man's corpse. The faceless body was in the water for three months before it was found, according to Chan. Doctor Cream might have a secret purpose behind his challenge tonight, proving once and for all, Rocke's true involvement or his possible innocence. The Inspector wants to attend tonight also, but Charlie asks him to refrain from going, it is better that way; mice only play when cat is supposed to be in bed.There is a rain coming down heavy, when the Crime League Weekly Broadcast sign is hung on the entry-door of the Crime Museum by watchman Willie Fern, indicating the museum is closed to the public. Inside, Steve McBirney is wrapped about his head in bandages, Dr. Cream has prepared a model seating arrangement of tonight's guests, including Charlie Chan. The Chan seat is at the end, placed on an electrified platform Willie Fern finishes nailing, as McBirney shoos Fern away. The gimmick is for crazy Willie to think he is throwing the switch to the electric chair. Grenock has been outside rigging the power to the house to deliver sufficient power to kill anyone sitting in that chair. He comes in from the rain guarantying it to work, claiming all is hooked up to the switchboard now. Lily whispers to Cream, you cannot go through with this, it will ruin everything, this place, your racket.Lily and Dr. Cream slip into Cream's office, Willie checks the office door, then admits an unidentified woman out of the rain storm, she says she is a friend of Joe Rocke, she brought a pistol and offers it to Willie for Joe Rocke's protection. She says you can't let Joe down. He refuses her gun, she puts the gun in her purse. He tells the woman to take it to Joe, he escorts her to the back of the museum, requesting she go up the stairs and then go right home. Willie exits the room to make his rounds, taking his lamp and clock, he comes upon an open window, shutting it from the bad weather, while Jimmy Chan is hiding covered on a table near the same window. Jimmy sheds his raincoat and hat, placing them under the cover on the same table, he moves about checking out the criminal displays, stopping at the electric chair figure. Jimmy spots Grenock, with his wet raincoat and hat, entering a jail cell display. Grenock pushes a cell-bed aside, exposing a trap door, allowing access to the cellar, as Jimmy listens behind the door. Jimmy opens the door, seeing a figure standing in the cell with a bandaged head, he taps on the figure's head, thinking he is a museum piece. Jimmy, then exits the cell, before the bandage McBirney can grab the young Chan; afterward, McBirney descends the stairs into the cellar, following Grenock.Jimmy continues to investigate the criminal museum, with certain criminal figures all around him. Jimmy opens the office door, eyes engineer Edwards and Lily testing the radio broadcasting equipment, as Lily tends to a cut finger. Dr. Cream is giving Charlie Chan a tour of the museum wax pieces, while Jimmy looks on through the ajar door. Agnew joins Edwards and Lily, while Chan and Cream gather amongst them. Cream introduces Tom Agnew, announcer and director of tonight's program, to Charlie Chan, along with Miss Latimer, Cream's assistant, and Edwards, the engineer. Agnew asks for Mary. Lily explains, Mary is showing von Brom around the wax museum. Agnew is surprised von Brom is to be present at the broadcast. Cream said it was sort of a last-minute idea inviting him. Cream says he tried to phone Tom of the decision, but he was not available. Von Brom's voice is heard by Mrs. Rocke, claiming the figure he is standing near is Butcher Degan. Von Brom recalls seeing Degan in Chicago years ago, relying on his photographic memory; he remembers the face, the shape of the head.Agnew is taken aback, learning the broadcast has changed to the Rocke case. Cream, again, apologizes to Tom, saying he will get his notes for Tom on the case. Mrs. Rocke pauses on the spiral staircase, above the wax figure of her husband, recognizing von Brom's voice. Chan states, Joe Rocke was convicted for a crime committed by Butcher Degan, as Chan looks directly at Tom Agnew. He turns to Lily, looking at her, stating his theories are based strictly according to evidence from Dr. von Brom, having never saw Degan. Mary now asks for an explanation. Chan mentions two facts: McBirney and Degan were partners; McBirney, Degan and Joe Rocke were partners in an honest enterprise, too. Rocke was an honorable man, unaware his colleagues were criminals. Degan, like the brother Cain, hated Rocke, while mysteriously, like a freak of nature, McBirney had almost a brotherly affection for Rocke. Degan, like a true child of Cain, hated him. Von Brum is pleasantly surprised, hearing his evidence was taken into account by Charlie Chan. Jimmy is seen looking through an ajar door, and Mrs. Rocke watches from above on the spiral stairway.Chan continues, in order to acquire the business from Rocke, Degan caused Rocke to be suspected of a murder he did not commit. McBirney looks on through the cell bars, as Tom Agnew adds, brother McBirney had his revenge, I read that he killed Degan. Lily chimes in with Degan got what he deserved, based on the information Charlie mentioned. Charlie inspects Lily's sore finger, she claims she caught it on Dr. Cream's office desk. Charlie says beware of infection. Otto von Brum thinks of Degan out loud, hoping to prove something tonight. After he checks with downtown, Edwards, the radio broadcasting engineer, says we are ready to go in two minutes. Lily gives a hard glance toward the display of tools, i.e. wire cutters, on the shelf next to her. She makes a move toward the wire cutters, when Carter Lane, attorney for Mrs. Rocke, arrives, insisting to see Dr. Cream, asking him for the broadcast not to occur, for it will bring humiliation and rather painful memories to Mrs. Rocke. Cream insists they are within their rights, as reporter Mary Bolton wants to go on with the broadcast, speaking to Dr. Cream. Von Brom disagrees, there is one clue he did not understand, until now. He says he will tell everything about Joe Rocke, as Mrs. Rocke stares at the doctor, while hearing him speak. Von Brum promises to tell the police where to find the real murderer. Within earshot, as von Brum speaks, are Chan, Mary, Cream, Lane and Agnew. Mary says Mr. Lane is there to prevent von Brum from talking. Lane accuses Mary of being a little crazy.Tom Agnew tells everybody to take their places, they are about to start the broadcast. They are seated in their assigned seats, per Dr. Cream's model, as the broadcast begins. Dr. Cream tells everyone they are seated exactly as the family was gathered at the fatal breakfast table. They sit at the table with some debate where the two police sit, i.e. von Brum and Charlie Chan. The broadcast announcer, Tom Agnew, starts the program, setting the stage in an attempt to prove the innocence or guilt of Joe Rocke. McBirney tells Grenock to tell Willie exactly what I told you. Grenock introduces himself to Willie as the new warden. Grenock tells crazy Willie to throw the switch at exactly 8:20, electrocuting the dummy in the electric chair. McBirney and Grenock look on at the broadcast inside, from the cell bars. Cream starts the proceedings by telling the radio audience everyone is sitting at the breakfast table of June 9, 1929, as demonstrated in court. Von Brom insists on trading seats with Charlie, and Chan complies, von Brom sits, Willie throws the switch, the lights are out at the table, the rest of the room is lit, there is a flash of light brightening part of the room behind von Brum's chair, as the group sits in silhouetted images, someone douses the lights, Steve McBirney and Grenock exit down the cell stairway. The lights go back on, von Brom stands, rubbing his neck, Mary screams his name, Von Brom collapses at the table, Mary says he has fainted, Edwards and Lane carry von Brum to a nearby chair. He is pronounced dead by Dr. Cream. Chan inspects von Brum's chair, gazing over at Lily. Lane says there was a wire connected to that chair, that is the cause of the flash, the doctor was electrocuted. Chan corrects Lane, wire connected to chair was previously severed by wire cutters. Tom Agnew announces through the broadcast microphone the Crime League is discontinued at once. Mary Bolton begs Tom to continue with the broadcast, in order to explain what incident occurred. Chan stands, after inspecting the victim, announcing the criminologist was murdered, noting a small puncture on back of his neck. The peculiar discoloration on his neck indicates he was killed by the poison of headhunters from Borneo. A bamboo dart was found on Von Blum's coat collar. The dart was propelled by a blowgun serving as the poison carrier during the seconds of darkness, as Chan explains. The dart was aimed at the man's face, but von Blum turned his head, looking at the electrical display behind his chair, instead the dart struck him in his neck. Dr. Cream says there is a blowgun on display, leading Chan to that display. The blowgun Chan is shown by Dr. Cream has not been used, it is two feet or longer. Chan notices Lily's cigarette holder, commenting something such as this size or less could have used. Charlie accuses Lily of knowing the chair was designed to electrocute occupant, showing her a pliers he removed from a display shelf, after injuring his finger taking it from the shelf. He continues to tell everyone Lily used these wire cutters to severe the lethal cable. Her injured finger resulting from twisting wire holding implement on shelf, proof as Charlie says he received an identical wound doing same thing. Charlie questions Carter Lane's position near the wired chair, rather than at his assigned chair. Lane says he simply got up to see what caused the flash.Cream says he noticed Lane moved toward von Blum in the darkness, and Mary Bolton agrees, adding, the killer would have moved closer to take aim. Charlie notices a toothpick on table, warning Cream not to touch the evidence. Suddenly, the swami-dummy moves the chess pieces off the board, Chan approaches with pistol drawn, only to find Jimmy Chan behind the dummy. Returning to the table, the toothpick is missing, as they all return their attention to the table. Charlie orders everyone to Dr. Cream's office, nobody is to leave. Chan eyes Mrs. Rocke sitting in display nearby, she claims to have been asleep. She joins the others in Cream's office. Jimmy calls the police, but gets Grenock, who is disguising himself, as he confers with McBirney. He tells Jimmy the police are on the way. Charlie asks Cream to see switchboard, leaves Jimmy with group, Lane reminds the group one them is a murderer, then Jimmy leaves to find Charlie. The others split up, Lane asks Rocke what she did with that gun. She tells him never mind, saying Degan is here and she aims to settle the score. Mrs. Rocke retrieves the gun from her husband's wax figure, while Jimmy wanders about the museum.Charlie questions Dr. Cream, as owner of the wax museum, he cannot explain the electric wiring to the chair reserved for Chan. Charlie quizzes Willie about seeing the warden, who told him to throw the switch to the electric chair, asking him to describe the warden, as Cream says Willie imagines all of this. Willie gives a description, Jimmy interrupts, saying there is another person in this building. Jimmy describes the bandaged man with another, completely disappearing. Cream lies to Charlie there was a bandaged man that was a temporarily part of the museum. Charlie moves the bed, exposing a trap door, leading to a cellar. Cream says it is just a store room. Charlie invites Cream to lead the way. McBirney and Grenock are below, and move out of the immediate area, as the three descend the stairs. Mary listens to their conversation from above, and below, Chan holds up paper cutouts, a Steve McBirney signature, last seen in the courtroom. Dr. Cream lies, denies knowing Steve McBirney. Jimmy leans on a fake bookshelf, it swings opens into the surgery room, Charlie holds his gun on Cream, accusing him of changing faces of criminals to cheat the law. McBirney looks through into the room, watching and listening Cream denying any knowledge of him. McBirney and Grenock both listen through the wall to the conversation with Chan and Dr. Cream. Charlie says he now knows why Miss Latimer cut wires on chair; it was to prevent murder from exposing museum's most profitable business. The phone rings, Jimmy answers, it is Mary, thinking she has her city desk, but gets Jimmy, who explains the phone system isn't allowing any outside calls. Charlie checks a control on the wall, realizes the phones have been rigged to stay inside. Dr. Cream states McBirney had the phones rigged, and now they know it was von Brum who died instead of Charlie. McBirney and Grenock move toward Charlie, on the other side of the lab door. Cream admits he thought the two criminals had left, now I know they are still here waiting to kill. Chan says criminologist was not killed by McBirney, murderer was Butcher Degan. Three clues spell it was Degan: quill toothpick, bamboo dart and poison called Tonga. McBirney whispers to Grenock, let them spot Degan for us, then we will get them both. Chan states, Degan sent another man to meet McBirney's bullets, Degan was officially dead, he could move about with his new identity, until he was recognized by von Brum, then the doctor was killed to prevent exposure of Degan's new face.Chan puts it to Dr. Cream, which one is Degan? Cream lies again, saying he doesn't know. Tom Agnew comes down the stairs and intervenes, telling Cream, we are all in danger here, with the killer loose, you have to tell which person is Degan. Tom Ewing has a determined stare face-to-face with Dr. Cream. Charlie orders son outside to telephone the police, as they all come up from the cellar-laboratory, into the jail cell, with Jimmy grabbing a pair of handcuffs, before ascending the stairs. Chan requests Agnew lock the front door after Jimmy's departure. While the men were moving about, Mrs. Rocke was watching them, as was Willie, each from different locations. Jimmy cuffs his wrist and a wrist of Dr. Cream, thinking he has the suspect. The radio broadcast equipment cannot connect with the police, because they signed the museum location off, per Edwards.Charlie orders everyone to stay, he enters the office, saying he hopes to fix the phone. Lane is questioned of his behavior by Mary, and Lane says he came there to prevent a murder, Mrs. Rocke planned on killing von Brum. She believed von Brom persecuted Joe Rocke to make his case stick. Tonight, at her apartment, she threatened to shoot von Brom, if he wouldn't exonerate her husband. As Mrs. Rocke enters the room with the others, Lane says he is convinced she couldn't have killed von Brom. The lights go out. Someone says there's a killer among us, I hope this isn't somebody's idea of a joke. Charlie is heard and seen on the phone, sitting at a desk, talking on the phone to the police, while McBirney lurks on the other side of the office door. McBirney is suddenly grabbed away from the door, Charlie continues with his conversation, telling the authorities there has been a murder, Butcher Degan is still in the building, and witnesses to the crime are in great danger. Through the same office door, someone throws a knife into Chan's back, while he holds the phone, he is heard gasping, his voice stops. The knife is seen in the body's back. Mary screams, Lane turns on the lights, Agnew watches, Jimmy accuses Lily of turning off the lights, allowing Dr. Cream to escape. When the lights went out, Cream unlocked the cuffs and exited. Jimmy runs into the office only to see a man's body slumped on a desk, with a knife in his back. Jimmy screams, examines the body, Agnew comments, got him through the other door. Chan appears from behind the door, asking Agnew how he knew the killer used the other door. Agnew answers, Mary was outside this door. Jimmy says to his father, a trap was set to catch the killer. Charlie responds, he is grateful for his deceiving wax-twin, but the knife thrower escaped in the dark. Charlie requests Jimmy not touch the knife; it with be used to gather the fingerprints of the killer. Charlie sends Jimmy to go for police, again.Charlie asks everyone to assume positions before darkness. Jimmy finds the front door locked, looks for another way out, finding his hat and coat on the floor near the shut window, as the rain continues falling on the stormy night. Jimmy lifts the cover on the body lying on the table, yells for his father to come quickly. Jimmy tells Charlie it is the bandaged dummy he saw earlier, as Charlie removes the surgical bandages for identification. Orders everyone to touch nothing, the victim's fingerprints will prove the man was Steve McBirney. Chan assures Lane and Agnew that Degan has struck again, evidenced by a fatal knife wound in his back. Lane asks about the five crisscross scars in back of the body's neck. Chan responds with it was the signature work of Dr. Cream; incisions were made in surgery to tighten and alter the skin contour.Grenock was listening to their conversation from behind a door, he slips into another room, just as a man comes out of the rain through the same window near the body. The man is Inspector O'Matthews. The Inspector dropped by when the broadcast was cut off, figuring he better come over to see what was going on; mentioning he couldn't let my myself or my men in with the front door locked; Charlie hands Jimmy the key. The Inspector tells Chan they picked up Doc Cream outside, where he learned about Doctor von Brom; was it true? Charlie tells him yes, Steve McBirney was also murdered, and by Butcher Degan. Contrary to opinion, Butcher Degan is still alive, and he will be identified, when fingerprint expert arrives. As he made that comment, Chan had turned toward the five remaining in the room: Agnew, Lane, Mary Bolton, Lily and Edwards. The police bring Cream inside. The Inspector orders Pete to get homicide over to the museum now, and he tells Burns to see to it that nobody leaves. O'Matthews asks Cream to identify Degan, we cannot protect a man who won't name his enemy. Cream denies ever knowing Degan. Chan suggests others remain here, the Inspector follows Charlie, after he has his men secure the place, particularly to secure the back room window. Charlie asks Jimmy what he saw before the lights went out. Lane made a move toward the curio case, just before it went dark. Mrs. Rocke looks out from an office door. Charlie discovers a secret light switch inside door to the curio case. A raincoat clad policeman stands in front the display swami. Chan explains to O'Matthews, the killer knifed McBirney in the dark, but he met an obstacle with the front door locked; Charlie says he locked it as a precaution. Cream knows who Degan is, why won't he talk, O'Matthews asks. Charlie says Cream is too frightened to speak, fear is cruel padlock. The rain coated policeman yells out as someone makes a play for his weapon, Mrs. Rocke shoots the hand of the person hidden behind the swami, the cop and the Inspector pull Grenock from behind the swami. Charlie takes Mrs. Rocke's gun, explains prisoner is Grenock, McBirney's bodyguard. Grenock says he and McBirney were waiting for Chan to spot Degan. He claims Mrs. Rocke is Degan, she says she thought Grenock was Degan. Charlie comments Dr. Cream's surgery did not create Mrs. Rocke. O'Matthews orders Grenock to be taken out, asks Mrs. Rocke if she came to the museum to kill von Brum. Mrs. Rocke says she came there to confront von Brum, and to beg him to reconsider the evidence that convicted her husband. She pretended to be insane when first found, because she knew Degan was there. She tells Charlie she hid the gun when the lights went out. No jury would convict me for killing Degan, he framed my husband and sent him to the gallows. She entered the museum with the watchman feeling sorry for her, because he thinks she came to talk to her husband and she is certain the watchman did not throw the knife at Mr. Chan. Charlie agrees with Mrs. Rocke about who did not throw the knife.Jimmy asks his Dad how come Degan just doesn't shoot his was out with McBirney's gun. Chan fires back it could happen if he cannot remain invisible or he may strike from darkness with blowgun. Chan hands O'Matthews the antidote for Tonga, the poison used on the bamboo dart; Charlie says he got it from Dr. Cream's office. Chans shows the Inspector a duplicate blow gun used by Butcher Degan. Jimmy says that it is a toothpick from the automat. Charlie agrees. Von Brum was killed with a bamboo dart containing the original poison. Jimmy says Degan blew it into the doctor's neck, a mere scratch being fatal. O'Matthews finds that fact hard to believe. Chan demonstrates for the Inspector by blowing a dart into a wax figure, who happens to be Tom Agnew holding a gun. The gun falls to the floor, Agnew holds his neck, demanding the antidote from Chan, as Charlie now holds his gun on Agnew. Chan says to Tom, you killed Dr. von Brum, Agnew says yes; also, Steve McBirney, Agnew says I had to kill him. Chan further states you framed Joe Rocke, an innocent man. Agnew screams, demands the antidote, Chan says the dart was a broken matchstick, original needle of death is still in Chan's pocket; your prisoner, gesturing toward the Inspector.Mrs. Rocke thanks Mr. Chan for clearing her husband's name, for which she is deeply grateful. Chan replies, justice is like virtue, brings its own reward. Mary Bolton mentions any other radio man would have stayed on the air to broadcast von Brom's murder. Chan agrees, the suspicion was revealed when the broadcast was cut short by Agnew, and the telltale scars appeared on the figure's neck like those of Steve McBirney, evidence of surgery to head. Jimmy quips, McBirney gave the clue to spot Degan with similar scars on the neck. Inspector O'Matthews says Dr. Cream will get five years for altering the criminal's identities. The antidote for the blowgun poison was a bluff, it was a bottle of toothache painkiller. Mrs. Rocke, Mary Bolton, Edwards and Lane are innocent bystanders remaining in the museum. Jimmy is asked to relinquish his handcuffs by the Willie, saying they are museum property. Willie removes from Jimmy's wrist without a key."

The feather in his cap may be arranging the Paris Festival, an international festival highlighting the best in several areas of the performing arts. However, he makes a gaffe - sending the letter of invitation for the US theater representative who was supposed to be Ethel Barrymore to a New York chorus girl named Ethel 'Dynamite' Jackson instead - that may ruin his career, especially as Ethel Jackson has already received the invitation and is raring to go. After his initial panic, Winthrop is happy to learn that the media has picked up on the story which in turn has made Sherman come to the conclusion that sending someone from the rank and file like Miss Jackson is a stroke of genius. The trip is nothing as Ethel imagines, as it entails many lessons in refinement so that she doesn't embarrass the US government. Although Ethel and Winthrop get off to a rocky start because of many of these issues, the two fall in love.

Charley (William Ragsdale) is attending college and now believes that Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon), was nothing but a serial killer posing as a vampire. As a result, he comes to believe that vampires never existed due to extensive therapy has Charley has undergone.Charley, along with his new girlfriend, Alex Young (Traci Lind), go to visit Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall), who is again a burnt-out vampire killer who has returned to his old job of hosting 'Fright Night' horror films on TV much to the chagrin of the boy-who-cried-wolf Charley. It is while visiting Peter's apartment that Charley sees four coffins being taken into a car. On the way out from Peter's apartment, Charley sees four strange people walk past him, into an elevator. Charley instantly becomes smitten with one of the four, the alluring Regine (Julie Carmen). Charley drives Alex back to her dorm room and begins to make out with her, only to pull away and see Regine staring back at him. A ticked-off Alex storms off, not realizing that something is following her. Another girl leaves the dorm as Alex enters, and she is followed and killed by one of Regine's henchmen, Belle. Alex, meanwhile, is unaware that Louie, another of Regine's posse, is scaling up the wall outside her window, but he is startled and falls when Alex inadvertently slams her window shut on his hands. Bozworth (Brian Thompson), the third heavy, makes fun of Louie before consuming some bugs.Meanwhile later that night, Charley dreams that Regine comes to visit him, only for her to turn into a vampire and bite him. The next day Charley talks to his psychiatrist who assures him that what he dreamed was only natural. Alex finds Charley bowling, per doctor's orders, and Charley agrees to go to the symphony with her. On his way there however he sees his friend Richie (Merritt Butrick) with Regine and opts to follow him. Charley climbs up to a fire escape outside of Regine's apartment, only to be horrified when he sees Regine and Belle attack and drain Richie's blood. Charley runs off to find Peter, and the two of them arm themselves with crosses and crash Regine's party.There, Charley finds Richie but is shocked to find him alive and well with no bite marks on his neck. Regine makes her entrance, doing an erotic dance with a mesmerized Charley. She introduces herself to Peter and Charley, and claims to be a performance artist in town for some shows. Satisfied that what he thought was Regine attacking Richie was nothing but an act, Charley leaves when he remembers his date with Alex; Peter elects to stay behind and partake in the debauchery. Peter notes that there are people in the corners of the room biting others on the neck, piquing his curiosity. Noting the odd behavior, he draws his pocket mirror and finds that Regine and Belle, who are dancing in the middle of the dance floor, cast no reflections.Storming out of the party, Peter runs into Regine waiting for him outside. As he runs down the stairwell Peter again comes face-to-face with Regine, who reveals the ""eternal secret"": She is a vampire, the twin sister of Jerry Dandridge, and has come to take her revenge on both Charley and Peter. Peter runs back home and hides, resolving to tell Charley in the morning what has just transpired. Charley, meanwhile, blows off his date with Alex, returns home and falls asleep, only to be visited by Regine, who bites him on the neck while he sleeps.Charley, content with the explanation that Regine is a performance artist who only pretends to be a vampire, once again is in denial. He begins to discuss the situation with Alex when Peter arrives to try and warn the couple about Regine but neither believe him. Peter states that he has warned them and runs back to his home, packs his belongings and departs.Meanwhile, Charley has started to become more of a vampire, becoming sensitive to garlic and sunlight.

At the hospital, a commotion allows Alex and Peter to escape.Alex and Peter head to Regine's lair in order to save Charley. They find a disoriented Charley, who is slowly turning into a vampire. They rescue him from an undead Richie, and in the process manage to kill Belle, Bozworth and Louie before confronting Regine.

Jonathan takes his time perfecting the mannequin he is currently working on, which angers his boss who claims he needs to be working more on quantity than quality. Jonathan protests, but is fired. Unknown to Jonathan, Emmy has come to possess the mannequin he has just created. Jonathan attempts to find other jobs, but his artistic passion gets him fired from almost every single one. One evening after his motorcycle breaks down in the rain, Jonathan passes by some department store windows belonging to Prince & Company, and is surprised to see his mannequin in the store window.The next morning, Jonathan returns to the store, and ends up saving the life of its owner, Mrs. Claire Timkin (Estelle Getty), from certain doom.

Jonathan is soon paired up with the flamboyant Hollywood Montrose (Meshach Taylor), the store's chief window dresser. Jonathan eventually finds the mannequin he created, and is surprised when it comes to life when he is alone. Emmy then explains herself to Jonathan, who is unsure if he is dreaming or has gone insane. The next morning, Jonathan wakes up in a newly-created window display advertising tennis equipment and sports wear, unsure if he dreamed all this or not.The newly-created window display begins to attract attention, bringing shoppers back to Prince & Company. The landmark store has been losing shoppers to a newer and trendier department store named Illustra. Secretly, Prince & Company manager Mr. Richards (James Spader) is being paid to convince Claire to sell her store to Illustra. However, after the recent floor traffic seen due to Jonathan's window display, Claire feels that Jonathan could be the key to saving her store. Ignoring Mr. Richards, the board members promote Jonathan to visual merchandising.Over the next several weeks, Jonathan and Emmy continue their secret romance, and keep improving the creativity of the store's window displays. The window designs are bringing a tremendous number of customers and profits for the store. Jonathan soon receives a call from his former girlfriend, Roxie Shield (Carole Davis), who just happens to work for Illustra. Jonathan meets her for lunch at a French restaurant, where Roxie says that Illustra wants him to be their chief window dresser.

However, they are shocked when they see what appears to be Jonathan getting intimate with a mannequin (Emmy only comes to life or can be seen as living only when Jonathan is alone).

However, before he can leave, he is accosted by Roxie again, who claims he needs to seek help, going around with a mannequin on his motorcycle, and begs him again to come to work at Illustra. Jonathan denies again, claiming that he has people at Prince & Company who care about him, and someone who makes him feel special. As he rides away, Roxie shouts after him that he will be sorry and is making a serious mistake. Mr. Richards and former security captain Felix Maxwell (G.W. Bailey) realize that Jonathan has a fixation on one of the mannequins and plans to steal Emmy.Later that evening, Jonathan and Emmy enjoy their time alone in the store, before Emmy leaves his side to take her place in a store window.

Jonathan wakes up the next morning in the store and is informed of this plan by Hollywood. Jonathan immediately suspects Illustra is behind this, and drives over there with Hollywood.

In the aftermath, Claire comes to Illustra, and explains that she has videotape of Illustra's employees scheming to take over the company, as well as footage of them sneaking into the store after hours.

He recognizes the gravediggers as old friends, and they invite him to a party that night. He takes ecstasy (after refusing cocaine) at the party, but remains detached, and is also impressed by the abundant usage of drugs; indeed, this is the last time he's seen taking any drugs. At home, Andrew had his father book a doctor's appointment for headaches he's been having. During the scene, the father tells a lie but takes it back, and says he does not know why he lied.The morning after the party, Andrew proceeds to his doctor's appointment, meeting in the waiting room a girl named Sam, a pathological liar. She will later explain that most times she does not know why she lies, it's like a tic; but still one can trust her to admit her lies. During the scene, she tells him to listen to her music, saying it will change his life, and he does listen and appreciate the song. In Andrew's meeting with his doctor, it's revealed that Andrew has been on lithium, as well as other mood stabilizers and anti-depressants, for his entire adult life, but has stopped taking them. He also says that his father, who is also his psychiatrist, put him on the medications in the first place. Andrew finds Sam outside of the office, eventually offering her a ride home. Sam invites him to her house, and he meets her mother. After returning home, Andrew's father confronts him, who is insistent that they have a talk before Andrew leaves town.Right after, we see Andrew staring at Mark while he robs a tomb, while another Andrew's friend states that the town is ""so messed up"" because of drug usage, even if he's not exempt from it. This usage is also depicted directly in a number of scenes throughout the movie.Andrew then returns to Sam's house, and the two spend the rest of the day together joining his friends later. Andrew tells her that, when he was nine years old, he pushed his mother, resulting in an accident that left her a paraplegic; he says that he believes his father blames him for his wife's paralysis, and put him on his medications to ""protect him"" from the anger he supposedly harbors.

They then discuss the reasons for which Albert and his wife chose to live there. The house is described by Albert as ""his private ark"", a possible reference to the working title of the movie, ""Large's Ark""[citation needed]. Also, living there and exploring the abyss which was found in the quarry is described as ""doing something that's completely unique, that's never been done before"", a direct quote from earlier Sam's speech; but finally, Albert explains that what actually matters is just his family, and the camera shows right after the listening Sam and Andrew. A few moments later, the two of them kiss each other for the first time, after shouting at the infinite abyss for some reason not directly explained in the movie, left to the watcher to interpret.When they look at the gift, it turns out to be Andrew's mother's favorite pendant, that Mark had taken away from her grave and probably sold. Afterward, Andrew approaches his father for the talk the father had suggested, in which he says he was not to blame for his mother's accident and that, from now on, he will live his life without medication. He nevertheless forgives his father, and says he wants to build a better relationship with him.The morning after, Andrew says his goodbyes to Sam at the airport, acknowledging that she did change his life, and leaves for his plane that will take him back to his life in Los Angeles, to fix his problems before continue the relationship.

"When secret agent Starrbooty's neice Cornisha gets kidnapped by cosmetics company owner-slash-terrorist-slash-brothel owner Annaka Manners, she must go undercover as a prostitute to infiltrate Annaka's headquarters and come to the rescue.In other words:
The one and only Supermodel of the World RuPaul stars in Starrbooty, a sex-filled, riotously funny, jaw-droppingly crude, and down-n-dirty send-up of secret agent blaxploitation flicks that features some big porn star cock cameos. RuPaul isStarrbooty, a top (well, actually a bottom as you'll soon discover) secret ops agent who is plunged into chaos when her niece is kidnapped by long-time nemesis and fellow indulger of flawless skin and skin-tight couture, Annaka Manners (Candis Cayne). It seems that Miss Not-So-Nice Manners has a devious plot to snatch hookers off the street so that she can cut 'em up and sell 'em off one piece at a time. Starrbooty is forced to go ""undercover ho"" to rescue her niece... and her own true identity. Directed by hunky photographer and actor Mike Ruiz (that's him on the cover of Latin Boys Go to Hell), the hell-raising Starrbooty is stuffed and tucked with some of the most outrageously twisted set pieces you'll see this year. Highlights include a priest with a penchant for yanking his ""rosary"" while inhaling freshly expelled air biscuits, Starrbooty taking it up the wazoo from her boss, Max (a very naked Gus Mattox), explicit full-on frontal pleasures from Michael Lucas and Owen Hawk and a demented Lady Bunny unleashing her ""inner beauty"" in a scene certain to cause horrified howls of laughter. Truth be told, the too-closely shot hand held camerawork during the fight scenes requires the viewer to take a huge hit of Dramamine® to keep up with it, some of the jokes are groan-inducing, and a lil' bit of judicious editing could have kept the flick moving at a better clip. But make no mistake - Starrbooty is RuPaul's show all the way, and the forever Supermodel of the World delivers on all counts. Filled with references to iconic films; mad-fierce outfits, wigs and makeup; scatological humor (literally!); a wicked soundtrack; and plenty of exposed he-man flesh rods, Starrbooty is a fried, dyed and laid to the side-splitting kick-ass good time.

He could sell, settle his debts, and return to life with a clean carpet, or he could figure out why he doesn't want to part with the dog.::<jhailey@hotmail.com>"

"Chester Thomas King is a successful writer of pulp fiction. He has written and lived under many different pseudonyms, the most current being ""Mickey King"". A native Brit, he is currently living in Italy. Much like one of his trashy novels, Mickey narrates the story of a recent adventure in which he was involved that by its end would send five people to the morgue. At his publisher's office, he is approached by a man named Ben Dinuccio, the agent of someone famous, who would at this time like to remain anonymous, to ghostwrite that famous person's memoirs. Mickey agrees if only because of the exorbitant fee offered. Before Mickey can meet the person in question, he is sent by Dinuccio on a multi-day tour throughout Italy to hide the person's identity and locale for safety reasons. Mickey will be contacted along the way by a yet unknown person, who will lead Mickey to his ultimate destination. An incident en route leads to Mickey questioning taking the job. That feeling is strengthened when he meets the subject person: ex-Hollywood movie star Preston Gilbert, whose private life was rumored to have been associated with gangsters. Preston has a wicked temper and unusual sense of humor. Another incident during Preston's dictation and Mickey's writing process leads to Mickey believing that his life is in danger, because of what he eventually learns is something that may be written in Preston's memoirs. Mickey has to do some digging if he is going to figure out what that story is, and who if anyone is trying to kill him.::Huggo"

"In this sequal to American Graffiti, set over the four consecutive New Year's Eve's from 1964 to 1967 depicts scenes from each of these years, intertwined concurrently with one another as though events happen simultaneously. The audience is protected from confusion by the conceit of a distinct cinematic style for each section.Northern California, New Years Eve, 1964. John Milner (Paul LeMat) is now a drag racer. He and his fellow competitors are racing each other for the right to race against the car made by a national racing team known as ""The Factory"". He gets to meet his old school friends Steve Bolander (Ron Howard) and Laurie Henderson (Cindy Williams) whom are now married and Laurie is nine months pregnant and expecting twins. Terry 'The Toad' Fields (Charles Martin Smith) also turns up having joined the U.S. Marines and whom is with his fiancee Debbie Dunham (Candy Clark). John also meets Carol (Mackenzie Phillips) whom has dropped out of high school and is now a hippie drifting around the country in defiance of her parental rules. While John deals with his manager wanting him to win the upcoming championship after he loses his latest match. But John has other complications when Teensa (Mary Kate Place) a former high school girlfriend, leaves behind a non-English speaking foreign exchange student named Eva (Anna Bjorn) whom is from Iceland and John attempts to woo her despite the language barrier.South Vietnam, New Years Eve, 1965. (Note: all of these sequences are shot hand-held on grainy super 16 mm film designed to resemble war reporters' footage.) Terry Fields is serving his tour of duty and sets out trying to wound himself so he can get sent home and be reunited with Debbie, but had a lot of bad luck wanting to do so. After an attempt to shoot himself causes an all-out artillery and airstrike against his location, he deals with his commanding officer, the pompous Major Creech, whom is trying to impress a visiting U.S. Senator both of whom appear indifferent to the troop's living conditions and low morale caused by frequent enemy ambushes and harassing attacks. Terry is partnered with Little Joe Young (Bo Hopkins) the former gang leader of the Pharaohs back home whom deal with a naive and newbie helicopter pilot who seems eager for action, but soon realizes the brutality of the war.San Francisco, California. New Years Eve, 1966. (Note: these sequences echo the movie of Woodstock using split screens and multiple angles of the same event simultaneously on screen.) Free-spirited Debbie ""Deb"" Dunham has turned from drinking Old Harper whisky to smoking marijuana and has given up her platinum blonde persona for a hippie/groupie persona and is now living in a commune with several other hippies including Carol, who has renamed herself 'Rainbow'. Deb and her boyfriend are pulled over in their car where he gets arrested for marijuana posession by a motorcycle cop whom is former drag racer Bob Falfa (Harrison Ford, in an uncredited cameo). As Deb sets about to get bail for her boyfriend, she embarks on a strange surreal acid-induced journey through the city from the strip club where she formerly worked, to the commune, and to a gun-tooting pimp to get the money. As soon as Deb posts her boyfriend's bail, she, Rainbow, and another hippie, named Moonflower, set out to get access to a strange country-western band whom Deb joins on her mystical journey of self discovery.Modesto, California, New Years Eve, 1967. Steve and Laurie Bolander deal with their crumbling mariage. They have money problems, and Laurie wants to help by getting a job, which the sexist and traditional-minded Steve is absolutely against. He says that a mother's place is in the home and won't talk about it anymore. An angry Laurie storms out and goes to her younger brother Andy's apartment. (Note: Laurie's twin brother Curt is said to be living in Canada as a draft dodger). Andy lures Laurie to an anti-war demonstration at a local college campus. Steve sets out to find Lauire and he too gets caught up in the protest which leads into a full-out riot. (Note: these sequences attempt to memorialize the late 1960s with the scenes that recreate the sense and style with references to Haight-Ashbury, the campus peace movement, the beginnings of the modern woman's liberation movement and the accompanying social revolt.) One character burned his draft card triggering the rioting... showing a younger audience what so many Americans had done on the television news ten years before the movie's release. More scenes afterwords show both Steve and Laurie's reactions to the police brutality on the campus demonstrations with billy clubs during the protest.In 1964, John beats everyone, but wrecks his car in the last race. With only a few minutes to make repairs, all of the other teams help John and his team make the repairs and get to the starting line before having to forfeit. He beats the Factory car, and is told by their owner that he has what it takes to go pro. Also, with the help of a groundskeeper acting as a translator for Eva, he managed to tell her how he feels towards her before she leaves. The segment ends with John driving his trademark yellow Deuce at night along a lonely highway toward another vehicle's headlights, and is never seen going further... hinting that the crash was in that vicinity.In 1965, when Terry and Joe's chopper is shot down behind enemy lines and Joe ends up dead from a sniper's bullet to his chest, Terry and the pilot Lance, are rescued, but Terry becomes alinated with Major Creech who downplays the events to please the visiting Senator. Later that night, the Creech is cutting a cake made for him and his officers that was presented by Terry. Terry runs to the latrine he is assigned to clean when the cake is cut. Instead of the cake blowing up (as the viewer is led to believe would happen), the latrine blows up.Terry fakes his death in a latrine explosion in which he is declared missing in action. In a gag sequence, the feecies from the latrine rain on top of both Major Creech and the Senator who angrily declares, ""this is a filthy war!"" In the final scene, Lance meets with Terry who gives him the supplies he needs as Terry sets off to hide out in Europe, free from his war duty, but thus never return to the USA (It is never revealed what happened to Terry's fate afterwards if he really did escape from Vietnam).In 1966, Deb goes to a local band to see if they will give her boyfriend a tryout. Newt (Scott Glenn), the leader of the group, is reluctant to do so, but Debbie, Rainbow, and Moonflower tag along to their next gig at a country bar in order to keep convincing Newt. He finally does, but he also begins falling for her. At the gig, Newt puts Debbie in the band as a tambourine player. While performing, she sees her boyfriend at the club dancing erotically with another woman. Debbie jumps off the stage and confronts him. The confrontation eventually leads to a huge bar fight. At the end of the night, Debbie has dumped her boyfriend and is asked to join the band permanently, which he does. She and Newt also begin a relationship.In 1967, Steve and Laurie and all their friends are arrested. When the police begin to abuse Laurie, Steve loses it and begins punching out the cops. He is quickly joined by all of the other arrested protesters and Steve, Laurie, Andy and his girlfriend escape custody. Back home, Steve tells Laurie that he has changed his mind and she can get a job.As with the first American Graffiti movie, the audience is given a last still images of the main cast and what became of them:-John Milner was killed by a drunk driver in December 1964.-Terry Fields was reported missing in action near An Loc in December 1965.-Steve Bolander is an insurance agent in Modesto, California.-Debbie Dunham is a country western singer living in Oklahoma."

"Synopsis - Charlie Chan in the Secret Service, created July 1943 and released 2-14-44
Scientist George Melton is conducting his experiments in torpedo prevention while his two Secret Service bodyguards, Inspector Jones and Agent Lewis, ask about the nature of the bombs displayed above his lab bench. He says they are all models, except one, pointing to a bomb with a cross on it. The bodyguards follow him to the lab door, they watch him fold his invention plans up, placing it in his coat-pocket-wallet, and tuck it into his suit coat. He explains he is having a cocktail party downstairs in his home and doesn't want them around. They each protest, for it is their job to watch over the invention plans he carries. He tells them, you guard the outside, and in the lab, otherwise, leave me be with my guests. George Melton summarily dismisses the agents because his invited guests would not harm him nor steal his plans; do you think I invite my country's enemies to cocktails?George Melton descends the stairs in his stately home, while an eye through a door is shown following his steps. Melton opens a large closet door to apparently hang up his laboratory coat, pulling the string for the closet light switch, he falls to the floor. The bodyguards remain up in the lab while the stranger with the peering eyeball watches Melton fall. A woman's scream prompts the men to descend the stairs to Melton's body lying near the closet. Inspector Jones checks the coat-wallet for vital papers he was carrying, while people have gathered around, and Birmingham Brown is trying to avoid the entire scene, carefully moving across the recess of the room. Agent Lewis asks where he is going, and his response is anywhere, I have an important date. Lewis replies, I'll say you have. Birmingham says he is on an errand for Mrs. Winters, the agent responds you stay here. Jones says he is dead and the plans are missing. The group watching the body all look like suspects, but shocked; Mrs. Winters inquiries, did you say Mr. Melton was dead? She has her fur stole draped over one arm of her coat and her hat on her head. The agents ask Mrs. Hargue, Melton's housekeeper, if anyone is upstairs. She says no one; everybody in the house is here in plain sight. Inspector Jones has Lewis look around and asks everybody to go in the living room, please, as Birmingham gives a wide-eyed look toward them, and then enters the living room. A man stops short of the living room entrance and questions Jones' authority. The response is Jones carries a Presidential warrant, showing his credential to the gentleman. Jones dials the phone in the foyer after closing the living doors.The phone was made to the Secret Service office, in which we see Charlie Chan, informing someone by his desk phone he expecting son and daughter. When they arrive, send them to his office immediately. Charlie is summoned on the intercom. Chan enters the room of his boss, Mr. Slade, who informs him George Melton, the man they have been guarding, is dead. Slade tells Charlie, Melton's invention would completely destroy the U-Boat menace. An outside agent at the front door of the Melton house assures Inspector Jones, the place is being guarded; the rule is no one exits the house without the proper credentials. Slade tells Charlie, Mr. Melton had the only copy of his torpedo plan on him, and it is missing; it is up to you to find those plans. Charlie suggests to Slade perhaps this might be the work of skillful spy Manlick. Charlie enters his office where his number three son Tommy and number two daughter Iris are waiting. He orders a cab, postponing their sightseeing trip, requesting they return to the hotel. They plan on finding where their father is going, as Charlie is seen leaving in a cab.Chan exits the cab as an agent opens the driveway gate, another agent along the walk to the house acknowledges him, and finally, Charlie is greeted at the front door by Sergeant Billings, an old friend from Hawaii and the USMC. The sergeant is now guarding dead people, he tells Chan, rather than being with his fighting outfit, he opens the door for Charlie. Charlie greets the Medical Examiner-Doctor, bends to examine the body. Birmingham Brown tries to make another exit, but is cut short by Lewis, pointing him back to the living room. Charlie inquiries with the doctor, asking for the cause of death. A superficial exam revealed no cause, except perhaps a natural one. Chan requests the autopsy results as soon as available. The doctor says he will have the boys remove the body right away. Charlie greets the Inspector, shakes his hand, glad to see you again Jonesy, he says. They are standing in the foyer, Jones says he searched everyone and took statements from them all, handing Charlie the statement notes. Housekeeper Hargue tries to go upstairs, Chan tells her please, do not go upstairs. Jones says, he and Lewis have been searching downstairs for Melton's plans, he had it on him when he came downstairs and died. The Inspector tells Chan, the Arranto's plan on leaving for California tomorrow. Charlie tells him, no one leaves until the case is solved satisfactorily. The person looking through a peephole is watching the two detectives. Charlie tells the Inspector, while part in the closet, it appears that Mr. Melton came here to this spot and died. Jones said they searched the closet but found nothing. Charlie pulls the light's string to shut it off. Jones closes the closet door, the whole time they are watched by the unknown eye. Mrs. Winters opens the living room door, sees Charlie and the Inspector, frantically giggles, and re-enters the living room. Jones explains the nervous type is Mrs. Winters, she came for cocktails and got hysterics. Inez Arranto and Luis Vega happen upon the detectives, reverse course, and return to the room. Jones informs Charlie Vega is a war refugee, now a salesman, the woman is the sister of Paul Arranto. Jones points out the pictures on the wall of George Melton, Yale baseball and Glee Club. Lewis brings Chan the found Melton plans from the living room. He shows him the book he found the plans in on the bookcase shelf. Charlie tells the bodyguards the suspects will remain. Dead man's actions call urgently for an explanation of how he can walk around after he is dead.Iris and Tommy Chan greet Sergeant Billings at the door, he allows them to look around outside only. Charlie has the suspects all in the living room. He is listening to Mrs. Winters talk about her dog at home needing to be fed. Birmingham says he will attend to the dog. Chan questions Birmingham, asking if he is chauffeur for Mrs. Winters? Why are you here? Birmingham explains he brought a Statue of Liberty model. Mrs. Winters claims she made it herself, as a present for Inez, as a going away gift. He meets with indignation in varying degrees from the other suspects as he goes around the room speaking with them. Wheelchair bound Paul Arranto would rather speak for his sister and his aid, Peter Laska. Charlie corrects Paul, he would like each person to speak for them self. David Blake is belligerent to being questioned, and Chan returns the volley with a quote to Blake. Chan asks Mrs. Hargue, you were in pantry when Mr. Melton was found? Yes sir, when I heard the scream I ran into the hall and saw Miss Arranto kneeling aside Melton. She seemed to be searching his pocket. Charlie points out to Paul Arranto that he seems to silence everyone. Charlie asks who was first to discover body? He gets multiple replies to the affirmative, asking if anyone else would like to nominate self as discoverer of body? Birmingham finishes someone's drink at the bar. Luis Vega, with his cigar, is totally uncooperative, telling Charlie he was in the den when Mr. Melton came down the stairs. Chan returns with, when alibi pushed at me, I always suspect motive in woodpile. Mrs. Winters, Chan asks, when you heard scream you ran out into hall? Not at first, I was putrefied!Charlie performs a demonstration, asking Mr. Lewis to take book from bookcase. Lewis takes a book from the right side of case with his right hand. Chan asks selected guests to pick a book from the shelf. Each willing guest uses their controlling side or favored hand to grasp a book from a like side as their controlling hand. Mrs. Winters used her left hand to grab a book from the left side of the bookcase, she appears startled, dropping the book, saying after all I am left-handed. The others used their right hand to pick a book from the right-hand side of the bookcase. Chan says Mr. Melton was left-handed. Mrs. Hargue says Mr. Melton was left handed. Furthermore, based upon the picture of the Yale baseball team inscription in the hallway, the picture is inscribed with the nickname port-side, or a left-handed ballplayer. Paul Arranto asks Chan what this has to do with the bookcase. Chan answers, strange that Mr. Melton would place document in bookcase, stranger that Melton placed the document in the right side of bookcase and strangest still, that a dead man lying in the hall was able to reach the bookcase at all. Also, if one would follow the directions on the found plans, you would find they are as dangerous as an unloaded toy pistol, according to Charlie; document is very poor forgery.Iris and Tommy Chan are entering the house through a basement window, Tommy falls, hears Birmingham's voice, Jimmy and Birmingham wrestle in the dark, Chan turns on the light, Charlie sends Birmingham upstairs, the two Chans try to explain why they are in the house. They all come upstairs, first Charlie sends them to the hotel, but Vega says they could carry out the so-called important document, couldn't they? Charlie agrees, tells offspring to remain in pantry. David Blake asks Charlie as soon you find whatever is missing, can we go home? Chan replies, as soon as the genuine Melton document is found and his murderer, the others will be dismissed. People in Washington don't go about murdering, quips Mrs. Winters. Evidently there are a few which are present that have forgotten the rules. Arranto adds, surely you don't think one of us is guilty? Chan returns with difficulty now is to find someone present who could not be guilty. Charlie instructs a departing Lewis to have the coroner send the autopsy report by special messenger and give Mr. Slade the full report of case up until now. The eye watches Charlie as he closes the front door, he crouches to check the closet floor entryway, he hears something from the den, turns on the den light, looks around, he spots something on the upper hinge of the door, takes a finger sample and wipes it off, smiling. He sees the light switch cover is loose, he touches the light switch, the lights ceiling lights go out, the wall sconces stay on, he touches it again, all lights are on. He chastises his offspring with Birmingham standing near, he goes upstairs, soon followed by housekeeper Hargue. The offspring also head upstairs, Mrs. Hargue sees they are near, she enters a room, Iris and Tommy hide from her. Chan is sitting at desk, she hands him a knife Peter was carrying. She took it when he wasn't looking, she doesn't trust anyone with a thing like that, she tells Charlie, and I don't trust the people the people he works for either. Chan asks you do not trust the Arrantos? I won't say anything more, she answers, exiting the room. He tells Tommy he saw everything coming from mirror on wall, including Mrs. Hargue with a knife. Very strange woman, Mrs. Hargue, Chan tells his children. Charlie is reading Magnetic Properties of Electricity by Von Vegon.Someone in the dark rigs the safe with a pistol, Luis Vega enters the bar-room, pours himself a drink, exits. Paul Arranto enters the bar-room, shuts off the light. Someone steps outside through the glass-paneled doors, security stops him, sends him back inside. Charlie notices the picture covering the safe is tilted, blames Tommy, and Iris said we did not touch it; Birmingham agrees, none of them touched the frame. Chan finds a safe behind a tilted wall picture, Lewis says he found no keys on Melton, Charlie has Tommy rehang picture. Jones, Lewis and Chan are outside, seen through glass-porch-doors, Lewis said someone tried to get out, Jones guesses it was Vega. Someone is pointing a pistol at the men from behind a draped doorway, Birmingham Brown enters the bar-room as the weapon is retracted. Brown goes to the bar, makes himself a drink, he brings it to his mouth, sees a gun from the curtains, he screams, drops his drink and ducks, as the gun is fired at the glass door. Chan comes in with Jones, asking Birmingham what happened. He says the shot came from behind the curtain. Charlie finds a handkerchief behind the curtain. Chan tells Jones the linen he found belongs to Inez Arranto; Miss Arranto does not smoke. Chan says the person who left the linen behind the drape is a very heavy smoker. None of the women smoke. Jones says the men are heavy smokers. Mrs. Winters enters, makes a ditsy comment, Charlie retorts, excuse please, very busy, have murderer to catch, they each exit in different directions. Charlie directs Iris Chan to remain outside of living room doors, keep a sharp eye on Paul Arranto. Charlie asks and gets the household keys from Mrs. Hargue, tries to open the wall safe, as Tommy, Jones and Birmingham stand near and the eye watches them, as well, with the key turning but the safe does not open. Chan tells the Inspector it is time for messenger from coroner to arrive; Jones said he will check on that. Paul Arranto wheels himself out of the living room, Iris Chan guards the living room door, asking, coming out? Paul says, why no, and returns inside the room.Charlie cautiously enters the laboratory with Tommy and Birmingham. Charlie tries a few switches, lighting the fixtures around the lab. Chan finds the desk lamp with the devil-like mask is sensitive to movement, it moves as Brown moves. Chan discovers the photo-electric cell behind its glass eyes controls its movement; shutting it off, it remains stationary when Brown moves. Birmingham secures himself in one of Melton's experimental chambers. Iris Chan ties a curtain rope to Paul Arranto's wheelchair, while she hides herself in the adjoining room. A person is seen wearing a hat and overcoat, shutting off the lights in a hallway, while a hand is shown shutting off the lights in the laboratory, with Tommy and Charlie looking toward the switch area in the dark. The person shooting has a flashlight, dressed in an overcoat, shoots several times at Charlie, after he throws book at the shooter. The bomb on the upper rack is detonated and several more shots are fired at Chan. Tommy falls from the upper lab area, missing the steps, they rescue Birmingham, together all three-leave lab unhurt. Charlie and Tommy encounter David Blake, Tommy pats him for a gun, gives his father an all clear on Blake. Charlie tells Blake someone shot at him, Blake says he heard shots, heading this way when someone hit me. Chan says to Blake explanation too perfect to be true, downstairs please. Luis Vega in a chair, enters the living room, with everyone except Mr. Arranto, who wheels himself in with a sandwich he prepared while in the pantry, entering the living room. Charlie chastises Iris, I told you to watch Mr. Arranto. Iris claims she thought he was anchored to her rope. Her father shows it is tied to another chair.Jones hands Charlie the coroner's autopsy report. Charlie informs Jones for second time tonight he was the target of a killer. Someone left this room tonight and tried to kill me and number three son. Charlie tells Paul Arranto with an analogy doubting his innocence by making a sandwich. Chan demonstrates to all suspects how Mr. Melton died. He opened closet door, stood on the metal threshold, pulled the chain and he is dead. Melton was electrocuted. The murderer knew people who die of electricity have no marks upon their body to indicate cause of death. Blake asks Chan, if the coroner could not diagnose electrocution, how could you? Tacks on heel of shoe conduct electricity. Photograph from autopsy showed tiny burns on feet of victim. Vega tells Charlie you turned on the light and nothing happened to you. Birmingham please turn off light in closet. Mr. Vega is asked to turn on light as Chan stands near switch. Vega hesitates, then harshly tells Chan to conduct his own experiments. Charlie tells the assembled group, the murderer wished to kill only one man, Mr. Melton. Chan hooks the wooden pole to the light chain, asks Brown to pull the rod when he says pull. Chan instructs the group, murderer-controlled electricity from this switch in living room. The switch is harmless, but switch panel is loose at top. Through the crack in living room door, the murderer watched Melton descend the stairs, open the closet door, then he pressed loose panel, Brown pulls rod and flash occurs from the light fixture. Faces of the suspects are shown as the demonstration concludes. Chan goes to Paul, asking do you need a refreshment? I could use a drink, he wearily answers, Jones grabs his wheelchair, escorting him to the bar, the others follow, Mr. Vega is stopped by Chan. He asks Luis if he was planning to leave for California tomorrow with the Arrantos. Yes, he answers. So sorry, replies Chan, must detain you.The group has reassembled in the living room. Vega is on the couch, opposite Mrs. Winters. Chan asks him, do you carry gun? No, is the answer. Being refugee from Europe, do you know many people from Germany? Jones is standing next to Charlie, when he questions Vega if he knows someone named Manlick. He says no. Jones says maybe your name is Manlick. Your last name is really Vega? He replies yes. Could not possibly be von Vegan? No is the answer from Luis. Chan quotes scientific who's who in Germany shows your picture as Phillipe von Vegan. You are no salesman, you are celebrated author and electrical engineer. Chan says murderer now seated on divan. Mrs. Winters reacts to the accusation, springing up, saying that's a lie. She walks across the room. Luis asks Chan, you are accusing me of murder? Chan retorts, you are electrical engineer; murderer always chooses the weapon he knows best. Luis Vega denies the accusation, a click sound is heard, as Luis breaks a new cigar in his hand, he slumps in the divan, with his head on the arm rest, dead. Tommy sees the hole in the back of his suit coat, this guy is dead. Tommy asks where the gun is, you would have a gun to make a hole like that. Chan stipulates, killer discovered of George Melton, now which one of you killed Luis Vega?David Blake denies killing anyone. Peter Laska denies knowing Vega. Jones asks Mrs. Arranto to step toward him. Jones squeezes her arm, forcing her to confess, when up from the wheelchair bounds Paul Arranto. Jones and Chan apologize, it was Charlie's idea to prove Paul could walk. Paul says he was in an accident some months ago, recovered, but remained in the chair to see which of his political enemies would do if they believed he would not enter politics again. Sister Inez Arranto swears he is telling the truth. The Chans and Jones go behind a curtain in another room, Charlie tells Jones, he already knows where the gun is, a strong suspicion of who the killer is, but without proof on how the trigger was pulled, he cannot accuse anyone. Mrs. Hargue is behind the curtain with another key she found on the piano. She has no idea what lock it fits. Charlie tells Jones torpedo plans are still missing, have one more place to look, if plans are not there, will expose Vega murderer and have guilty person lead me to missing document. Charlie tries the new key in the wall-safe-lock, while Tommy tries to tell him something, the pistol in the safe fires, firing bullet, missing Chan. Jones enters, asks what happened, Chan answers, third and final attempt on my life; Chan adds, wall safe is also a murder trap. Charlie announces to the remaining suspects gathered in the living room, in ten minutes, I will arrest murderer of Luis Vega.Tommy sits on couch at Charlie's insistence, Charlie says murder gun staring at us like clock trying to hide face behind hands. He removes a spring-loaded pistol from display on the wall, his nose to the barrel produces a smile on his face, Charlie says spring-gun is noiseless, replacing it with loading one bullet into his own revolver, and placing that gun up on the display. He summons and questions Peter Laska about where he was standing when Melton came down the stairs. Next to the bar, responds Laska. Chan claims you had a view of everyone in the room, yet you did not see Mr. Vega. Luis Vega killed Mr. Melton, then he came down the hall and through that door. You have gun permit, where is gun? Laska replies, it is in my room. Chan says you did not leave the gun in the pantry to shoot at me? Jones walks in with a gun, checking the cylinder, recently fired four times. Jones says he found it in the pantry, Chan adds, it was same gun used on me in the pantry. Laska insists he never used that gun. Chan adamantly infers Laska left the gun in the pantry for Vega to use on Mr. Melton. When Vega was ready to confess, you killed him. Laska denies the entire event. Chan orders the arrest of Peter Laska for the murder of Luis Vega. Jones escorts Laska away.David Blake comments to Charlie, we were all in this room, I don't see how Peter could have killed Vega. Chan directs the group to follow, he will show how Vega was killed. Noiseless spring-loaded gun was displayed on the fireplace wall. Vega's books, one in particular, gave me the insight, the relationship between magnetism and electricity. A magnet fired that gun. When magnet was activated, gun pulled against trigger and fired itself. Mrs. Winters is poised watching Chan's speech and demonstration, on arm resting on the back of a chair. Iris asks, where is the magnet? Chan continues saying magnet is directly in line with gun. This is electromagnet and murder weapon, as Charlie points to the object attached above a lamp sitting on a table directly in line with gun. Chan demonstrates the magnetic attachment by placing a letter opener on the lamp's rounded fixture. Peter was nowhere near the table when Vega was killed. I don't see how he could have done it, insists Paul, Peter stood right beside me at the piano. Chan agrees with the assertion, all of you were at the piano when the murder occurred, therefore, piano is instrument operating the magnet. Chan walks to the piano and tells the group, everyone was watching Vega while at the piano, switch that operates magnet is located here at the piano. Charlie sits on the piano bench. He demonstrates firing his gun on the fireplace wall by flipping the switch near the base of the piano. The gun fires at the divan where Vega was sitting. Chan says that is how Vega was killed. Mrs. Winters asks Charlie if we can all go now, Chan responds everyone may go now; Mrs. Winters has her fur over arm walking away.She heads toward the other room and Laska appears, blocking her way, she heads back toward the other room, with Jones blocking the way. Mrs. Winters asks, what is the meaning of this? Chan replies, we have finally caught the real murderer of von Vegan. Charlie concludes, saying the only person able to operate switch was seated at time of murder. Peter Laska was standing. You, Mrs. Winters, were the only one seated at the piano. You were working with von Vegan, and thinking he might confess, you killed him, as Charlie wrestles the Statue of Liberty souvenir from under Winters stole. He cracks it open to find the original torpedo plans inside the statue, the final proof of guilt. You are under arrest Fraulein Manlick, Jones hauls her away. Charlie apologizes to Laska, I had to pick on you in order to catch real criminal. Perfectly alright, Laska says Mr. Jones told me about it. Chan says he is grateful to everyone for their cooperation. Brown asks Charlie if Mrs. Winters was doing all the murders? Charlie nods, as Birmingham heads to the phone, calling the employment agency asking for a job with the defense department. When they say he will need an availability ticket from his last employer, he responds oh, oh, Mrs. Winters was his last employer."

"When Possum Lodge is taken to court by big-shot executive Robert Stiles, whose limousine was damaged while parking at the Lodge, the boys are ordered to pay $10,000 in damages within ten days - or their beloved Lodge will become property of the town. Likely to give up their first born before they give up their lodge, the crowd puts their heads together and come up with not one, but three methods of raising the money. It is quickly agreed however, that selling chocolates door to door, or fire powered potato guns to children, may be too complicated. Ultimately, it is Harold who timidly suggests participating in the upcoming Duct Tape Festival in Minneapolis-St. Paul. There, a competition to create 'something' made of at least 50% duct tape, will garner the third prize winner exactly $10,000. Naturally, our boys band together and go for the bronze! Before long, a large Canada goose covered entirely with duct tape is attached to the possum van, and Red and the boys set out on their pilgrimage to save the lodge. Mr. Stiles has an ulterior motive however, and has enlisted Possum Lake's Sheriff and Deputy to help prevent the lodge from coming up with money to pay the fine. Consequently, what begins as an enthusiastic road trip is soon plagued with mysterious roadside obstacles that threaten to prevent the boys from ever making it to the competition.::Anonymous"

A writer impulsively buys a villa in Tuscany in order to change her life.::Anonymous
"Frances Mayes is a San Francisco-based literature professor, literary reviewer and author, who is struggling in writing her latest book. Her outwardly perfect and stable life takes an unexpected turn when her husband files for divorce. He wants to marry the woman with whom he is having an affair. Frances supported her husband financially as he was writing his own book, and he sues her for alimony despite her financial difficulties. And he wants to keep the house. Frances eventually accepts her best friend Patti's offer of a vacation, a gay tour of Tuscany which Patti and her lesbian partner Grace originally purchased for themselves before Patti found out that she is pregnant. The gift is a means to escape dealing with the divorce, from which Patti feels Frances may never recover emotionally without some intervention. Feeling that Patti's assessment may be correct in that she has too much emotional baggage ever to return to San Francisco, Frances, while in Tuscany, impulsively ditches the tour to purchase an aged villa, which ends up being a fixer-upper. Frances has many obstacles in eking out a productive and happy life in her new surroundings, that happy life which she hopes will eventually include rediscovering romantic love. In a discussion with sympathetic real estate agent Signor Martini, Frances outlines what emotionally she wants to accomplish with the villa, despite none of those items in a substantive material sense currently being in her life. In response, Martini tells her the story of a set of railroad tracks that were laid between Vienna and Venice before an engine that could make the trek being built, a train which now regularly travels the route. The question becomes whether Frances, in going through the process, will be laying another Vienna to Venice track, and if so whether that end product emotionally will be exactly as she envisions.::Huggo"

"A Kafkaesque story set in a dark, nameless city in a time that might be the 1920s or '30s. A killer () walks the alleys and underground passages. He corners a man and strangles him with piano wire.Max Kleinman (Woody Allen) is roused from a sound sleep in the middle of the night by a group of his fellow citizens who want Kleinman to help them catch the killer. Despite his protests of uselessness, the vigilantes tell Kleinman to get dressed and meet them outside. Kleinman's landlady (Camille Saviola) comes in to help him, suppressing his objections as she bustles about. He worries that he might run into his boss, who is considering him for a promotion, and make a bad impression. She suggests that he marry her, which would make him half owner of the rooming house so he would no longer need his job. Before he goes she gives him some pepper and tells him to blow it in the killer's eyes if he needs to get away. When Kleinman comes outside, the vigilantes have gone. He wanders around looking for them.Irmy (Mia Farrow), a sword-swallower with the circus, and Paul (John Malkovich) the clown, her lover, are talking in their caravan after the show. Irmy reminds Paul of their plans to quit the circus, get married and have children. He replies that he's an artist and needs to concentrate on his work until he can make a name for himself. She says that if she doesn't have a baby soon, she might not be able to, and starts to cry. The clown tries to comfort her. Then he says he'll talk to the head of the circus and goes out to find him. On the way he's distracted by Marie (Madonna), the tightrope walker, and goes into her caravan, where her husband the strongman is asleep. But Irmy sees him go in and comes raging to the door, catching the couple in flagrante. She's furious; she pushes Paul around and tells him she doesn't want his baby.Kleinman stops to see the doctor (Donald Pleasence) in hopes of learning where to find the vigilantes. The doctor has performed autopsies on the killer's victims -- apparently there have been several, and some of them are still lying on the doctor's examining tables. He believes that if he can dissect the killer's brain he will be able to identify the physical manifestation of evil. All this makes Kleinman even more nervous than usual, and the doctor gives him a glass of sherry to calm him down. He is surprised and disapproving when he learns that Kleinman doesn't know his part in the plan to catch the killer, and urges him to find out quickly what's expected of him. Kleinman goes back out into the foggy night. Shortly afterward the killer comes in. The doctor gets out of the house, but the killer pursues him and the doctor is caught in a blind alley and strangled.Irmy, carrying a suitcase -- running away from the circus! -- crosses a bridge and comes across a prostitute (Lily Tomlin). They chat and Irmy confesses she has nowhere to sleep. The prostitute offers her a bed at the whorehouse, where the other prostitutes (Kathy Bates, Anne Lange, and Jodie Foster) feed Irmy and make her feel welcome by talking about themselves and their work as they eat. One (Lily Tomlin) explains how she came to be a whore: her husband needed an operation and they were broke, so she sold her body to pay the doctor. When her husband found out how she raised the money, he kicked her out. When the customers arrive, the prostitutes leave the kitchen to greet them. A student called Jack (John Cusack), a regular, catches sight of Irmy and suddenly no one else will do. He offers more and more money, despite being told that she isn't an employee, eventually reaching the huge sum of $700 -- his gambling winnings for the night. Irmy accepts and they repair to a back room.Kleinman goes to the police station to protest the arrest of the Mintz family, who are considered undesirable, on no particular charge (though one of the cops feels that the arrest will be justified post facto if the killings stop while the family is locked up). Kleinman gets nowhere with his protest, but learns that the doctor has been murdered and that the police know the killer entered the doctor's laboratory. They have a glass they believe bears the killer's fingerprints. Kleinman realizes that the prints on the glass are his.Irmy and Jack, having concluded their business, exchange compliments as they dress -- they both enjoyed the experience.Irmy is hauled into the police station; the police have raided the whorehouse and arrested her because she doesn't have a prostitute's license. Irmy loudly protests that she isn't a prostitute, she works at the circus. They don't believe her; if she's not a prostitute, where did she get $700? She pays a $50 fine and is released just after Kleinman, having swiped the incriminating sherry glass, slips out. He offers to escort her. They encounter a vigilante who (after castigating Kleinman for not knowing his role in the plan) insists that Kleinman help him capture a man who is lurking in an alley. Kleinman is unable to wriggle out of it and shamelessly hides behind Irmy when she offers to help. The man in the alley, when captured, turns out to be Kleinman's boss, Mr. Paulsen (Philip Bosco); he was peering through a window at a woman who was undressing, and he's not pleased to be caught. He tells Kleinman he won't be getting the promotion he was hoping for; it sounds likely that Kleinman will lose his job.In search of Irmy, Paul wanders into a bar, where he gets to talking with Jack. He's flabbergasted when Jack confides that he just paid $700 to have sex with a sword swallower -- who is clearly Irmy -- and it was marvelous for both of them. (""I think she's got a lover who doesn't service her too well -- some poor clown... I gave her the best time she's had in years."")As Irmy and Kleinman approach a church, Irmy explains that she wants to donate her remaining prostitution earnings to charity. She asks Max to take the $650 into the church for her. Inside, he finds a priest (Josef Sommer) and a police official (Ira Wheeler) engaged in making a list; they tell him to go away and become irritated when he diffidently calls their attention to his errand. When the priest grasps the size of the donation (and the cash), though, he makes the policeman remove Kleinman's name from the list.Back in the street, Kleinman and Irmy meet a woman (Eszter Balint) who asks them for help. She has a baby (Rebecca Gibson) but no money, no food, and no family or friends to help her. At Irmy's request, Max goes back to the church and takes back half of her donation so they can give it to the destitute woman. The priest and the cop put Kleinman's name back on their list, but he brings out $300 and gives it to the grateful mother.Looking for a place for Irmy to spend the rest of the night, Kleinman takes her to the house of his fiancée Eve (Kate Nelligan) and asks Eve if Irmy can sleep on her couch. Eve, annoyed at being woken up and entirely unsympathetic to Irmy, refuses. She adds ominously that she'll speak to Max about this later. As they walk away, Max admits that Eve is a cold fish. He and Irmy walk to what seems to be a river embankment and stop to look at the stars. An acquaintance of Kleinman's discovers them and reveals that there are at least three vigilante factions, and the leader of the group that rousted Kleinman out of bed has been killed by one of the other factions. The man tries to force Max (at knifepoint) to join his own vigilante group. During the discussion Kleinman's original group shows up, and everyone is suspicious of Kleinman. Irmy is supportive, but can't help much. A crowd approaches, bringing with it a psychic called Spiro (Charles Cragin) who claims to discern secrets by literally sniffing them out. He applies his nose to Max and indicates that Max has something hidden in his suit coat. A cop comes up and extracts the doctor's sherry glass, which the crowd takes as evidence that Kleinman is the killer. Kleinman escapes by throwing his landlady's pepper in his captors' eyes and running off.With the mob in hot pursuit, Kleinman runs to the dressmaking shop of his former fiancée Alma (Julie Kavner), who lets him in reluctantly and throws him out again after a brief review of the circumstances of their break-up (he failed to show up at the wedding and was found having sex with her sister in a broomcloset).Irmy, left on her own, is jumped by Paul, who is furious about her infidelity. As they argue, they hear a woman scream. In an alley, they find the body of the woman with the baby to whom Irmy gave money earlier in the evening. Paul finds the baby nearby. Irmy immediately decides that they must keep her, as she knows the baby has no one to care for her. Paul tries to talk her out of it, objecting (among other points) that they can't afford a baby. Irmy finds her $300 on the corpse. When she tells Paul she's going to raise the baby whether he helps or not, he comes around.Kleinman is welcomed at the whorehouse, where Jack is chatting in a philosophical vein with the prostitutes. He draws Kleinman into the discussion, but one of the women (Jodie Foster) draws him out again to take him upstairs. Kleinman can't get it up and leaves in a hurry when another whore (Lily Tomlin) tells him that some men are looking for him. Dodging the torch-wielding mob still searching the streets for him, he runs into his workplace rival, Simon Carr (Wallace Shawn). Carr tells Kleinman that Mr. Paulsen has given Carr the promotion, and repeats some highly unflattering remarks Paulsen made about Kleinman. Kleinman asks if Carr has seen a woman matching Irmy's description, and Carr says he saw her heading toward the circus with a man and a child.In their caravan, Irmy and Paul are feeding and fussing over the baby. Paul has become very protective of her and is full of plans: he wants her to go to school; he doesn't want her to grow up as a circus gypsy; he wants to have another baby so she won't grow up alone. Irmy is delighted, particularly by the last plan.She goes outside to get some water and is stalked by the killer. Max defends her, giving her time to escape. Then, having drawn the (slow-moving) killer's attention, he runs away, fetching up in the big top. The tent is deserted except for Armstead the magician (Kenneth Mars), who is getting drunk to celebrate the circus's closing performance. Kleinman gushes that he is an amateur magician and Armstead is his idol. When the killer enters the tent, Armstead, saying something about a mirror illusion, calls Kleinman over to a large mirror in the center of the ring. He steps into it and urges Max to follow, but has to pull him through when the killer gets too close. The flummoxed killer can see Kleinman and Armstead in the mirror but can't get at them; Max taunts him. He flips the mirror, turning Max and the magician upside down, then smashes it with a pole. This causes the inmates to appear in another mirror at ringside. Armstead waves his hands and a large cage descends on the killer, trapping him. Max and Armstead throw a cloth over the cage, Armstead waves his hands again, and when Max removes the cloth the killer is gone -- but reappears across the ring, securely shackled to a chair. The arrival of a mob of circus performers led by Irmy leaves Max little time to marvel over this performance. After some shouting, Max and the magician lead the mob to the killer -- who has once again disappeared, leaving his chains empty.As they file out of the tent with the performers, Irmy tells the others that Max saved her, and tells him how brave he was. He replies that he can be brave as long as he doesn't think about it. She says that the circus will be pulling out in a few hours and asks what he'll do. Armstead mentions that he needs an apprentice. Kleinman becomes excited at this prospect and tries several times to demonstrate a trick with a coin, but fails. Armstead is unconcerned by Kleinman's clumsiness and offers him the job. Kleinman objects that he can't just run away and join the circus (though it sounds like the solution to all his troubles); he says he'll go back to real life and marry his landlady. Armstead speaks darkly of ""the grey hat of compromise."" Max walks Irmy to her trailer, where they shake hands and say goodbye. Max stands thinking for a minute.Max follows Armstead back to the big top, where he accepts the apprenticeship and dismisses Armstead's warning that the pay is very low. One of the performers says that everybody loves Armstead's illusions, and Armstead replies, ""Loves them? They need them -- like they need the air."" Then he waves his hands and he and Max disappear."

Kleinman is included within the plan even though he is largely treated as a schmuck by those that know him, the members of the mob who don't even tell him what his role in the plan is, despite his repeated requests. In his wanderings through the dark and foggy streets, he encounters many people, most notably a young innocent named Irmy. A sword swallower with a traveling circus in town, Irmy left both the circus and her boyfriend Paul, one of the circus clowns, not only because she wants to have a baby and he doesn't, but because she caught him cheating on her.

"There is more to this story than this review lets on. It reflects all different facets of society over one drivers shift. He starts out it seems as a cold, ignorant man. But his character develops as the different people of Chicago come & go. His character shows through when he tells a woman the truth about one of the huys he has in his cab. One highlight of this is the amount of cameos by well known faces who seem to be doing this film for the craic. The cab driver reacts well to the madness surrounding him & you can almost share his tiredness at the end of the shift. Crackheads, stoners, posh randy lawyers, irate Pakistanis and the high & lows of the working day are dealt with in this low budget film.::Michael A Hunter <thewaas@yahoo.co.uk>"
"14 hours in the life of a Chicago cab driver is examined as he picks up fares from the good and bad parts of the city and emotionally connects to many of his passengers including a depressed rape victim whom he longs to help, but knows there is nothing he can do. Other fares include a drug runner and a manic race to get a pregnant woman to the hospital. Little is shown of the cabbie's own life and thus the film leaves us with no emotional connection to his life.::John Sacksteder <jsackste@bellsouth.net>"

"Set in the early 1970s in a racially mixed New York City neighborhood, nine-year-old Troy (Zelda Harris) and her older brothers Clinton (Carlton Williams), Wendell (Sharif Rashed), Nate (Chris Knowings), and her younger brother, Joseph (Tse-Mach Washington) are introduced as their father Woody (Delroy Lindo) is blowing a horn to call them in from playing to eat dinner. Their mother, Carolyn (Alfre Woodard) is introduced as well.Dinner takes place during which we find out that the Carmichaels' next-door neighbor, ""Tony Eyes"" (David Patrick Kelly) seems to be somewhat of a nuisance to the family, which includes continuously singing while they are eating dinner. During the dinner, Carolyn tells the children to clean the kitchen before they go to bed as she is going out with Woody for the night and the children need to start pulling their own weight. Troy urinates in her brothers' room while she is asleep, but Nate wakes her up. Carolyn comes home and comedically wakes all of the children up out of their sleep because the kitchen was not cleaned. There's some argument naturally on the part of the children to which Clinton says, ""I'd rather have a father than a mother any day"". The neighborhood junkie drug dealers are introduced: Snuffy (Spike Lee) and Right Hand Man (N. Jeremi Duru), who are glue sniffers.Tommy La La (José Zúñiga), Clinton, Nate and a couple of their neighborhood friends are sitting on the Carmichael stoop while listening to the radio and playing a baseball board game. Tommy La La takes a bottle and throws it at the door of Tony Eyes while yelling homophobic slurs. This starts an argument because Clinton says the Carmichael children always get blamed for the mess on his property. The argument ends as Vic Powell (Isaiah Washington), a Vietnam war vet, comes home and greets everyone. Vic is renting the upstairs apartment from the Carmichaels. Troy and her friends are sitting on a stoop at the same time having on and off arguments before deciding to jump-rope. Some neighborhood boys lure a cat away from a doorstep while the girls are jump-roping. One kid swings the cat over his head by its tail and throws it on one of the girls. This starts another argument and shoving match between the girls and the boys. Troy singles out one the boys, Greg (Peewee Love) for being a ""welfare case"" and calls him a ""stupid ass dummy.""Nate is sitting at the table with Carolyn standing over him waiting for him to finish his black-eyed peas. Woody comes home with ice cream and sand cake for dessert. Nate is happy until Carolyn tells him that he isn't getting any dessert until he finishes his black eyed peas. This causes his brothers to make fun of him and rub it in his face telling him how good their cake is. Joseph's cake is eaten by the family dog Mutley, so Nate's piece of cake is split in half by Woody to share between Nate and Joseph. Carolyn, tired of standing at the table waiting for Nate to eat, tells him one last time to finish his black-eyed-peas. Nate finally takes a bite of them and promptly throws up, which causes everyone runs from the table. Wendell is taking the trash out and decides to take some of it in Tony Eyes' area.Carolyn comes out to see what is wrong, and Tony Eyes tells her that Wendell and her kids are always throwing trash into his area. Carolyn responds by telling him that he and his home are nasty. The arguments continue as the neighborhood kids jump in. Tony Eyes is still yelling and arguing when Vic comes downstairs and tells him to shut up. In anger, he punches Tony in the face and goes back into the house. Troy sneaks out and goes to the corner store to get candy. While in the store, she is intrigued by a woman (RuPaul) and one of the store owners dancing erotically in the store. As Troy leaves the store to walk back home, she sees Vic getting arrested for punching Tony Eyes.Troy gets back home and her brothers bully her into sharing her candy. Clinton and Wendell want to watch the Knicks game but because they are outnumbered, they are stuck watching The Partridge Family which they dislike. Troy and her friend, Minnie (Tiasha Reyes), go to the neighborhood store where Minnie steals an ice cream bar by putting it under her shirt and walking out. Troy tries to do the same thing with a bag of potato chips, but she gets caught. The boys are sitting in Troy's room watching the Knicks game while Troy is in the bathroom stuffing her shirt with toilet paper. Woody and Carolyn are downstairs arguing because Woody's music is not providing for the family and Carolyn, a schoolteacher is the sole provider. They are also arguing because Woody caused the family to have bounced checks.The argument escalates as Carolyn yells upstairs for the children to turn off the TV because it is a school night. She charges upstairs with Woody following and turns off the TV. A defiant Clinton argues with Carolyn and turns on the TV. Carolyn grabs him up for disobeying and disrespecting her and Woody grabs her and carries her out of the room. Everyone is in on the fight as Woody is dragging Carolyn down the stairs and Nate is jumping on Woody's back. The other children have a hold of Carolyn pulling her in the opposite direction and Carolyn hurts her ankle in the struggle. Woody yells and everyone gets quiet as he expresses his need to respect for his work in the house. Carolyn kicks him out of the house.Woody comes over the next morning and brings flowers for Troy to give to Carolyn. Troy suggests that Woody ask Carolyn out on a date. Troy brings the flowers to Carolyn, who is still in bed and hurt, and asks Carolyn for a quarter. The next scene shows Troy searching the house for money and she goes into Clinton's room and finds his buffalo nickels and takes them all for cash, as well as taking his Knicks tickets for starting the fight between their parents. With the stolen money, Troy buys herself and Minnie ice cream cones. Clinton comes home and upon discovering his tickets are gone confronts Troy about them. She gives them back but also tells him that she spent ""those funny looking nickels of yours also."" After coming in from playing outside, Troy is confronted by Carolyn about the nickels to which Troy lies to her twice. While Troy is in the bathroom, Greg comes to Carolyn who is sitting by the window and tells her all the mean things that Troy has been saying about him.Troy has to apologize to him for all the ugly things she said about him. Carolyn sends Troy to the store to get dinner with food stamps. Troy, embarrassed, doesn't want to go. In the store, Tory steals a package of meat and 6 cloves of garlic by hiding them in her shirt so she won't have to use food stamps. She witnesses a neighborhood girl, Peanut (Kewanna Bonaparte) getting caught for shoplifting. As Troy leaves, she is attacked by Peanut, but the grocer breaks up the fight and Troy heads for home, without the food stamps. That night, Troy has a nightmare that Snuffy and Right Hand Man make her get high. She wakes up in a sweat with Woody wiping her face, assuring her that everything is going to be ok. Woody and Carolyn get back together and they all decide to go on a trip to get out of the neighborhood but as they are leaving a worker from Con Ed comes by to shut off the electricity because the bill is unpaid. The trip is postponed and because of the situation, the family has to use candles for light.A few days later, the family leaves Brooklyn to take Nate and Troy down South to stay with relatives. Troy stays with her cousin Viola (Patriece Nelson), who was adopted by Uncle Clem (Norman Matlock) and Aunt Song (Frances Foster). Troy doesn't want to stay, but she does it to appease her mother. Troy eventually starts having fun with Viola despite a dislike of Aunt Song and her beloved dog, Queenie. On Troy's 10th birthday, she gets a letter from Carolyn (who narrates it) telling her about the happenings in the neighborhood since the weeks she's been away. After reading the letter, Troy decides she wants to go home. Meanwhile, Aunt Song has been looking for Queenie all day, but to no avail. Later that day, Troy has a birthday party. Upset because she hasn't found Queenie, Aunt Song snaps at two of Troy's birthday\sleepover guests as she pulls the couch out for them to sleep on. When she opens the couch, a dead Queenie (likely killed by Viola) pops out which deeply upsets Aunt Song. Troy later goes home and is picked up from the airport by her Aunt Maxine (Joie Lee) and Uncle Brown (Vondie Curtis-Hall).Aunt Maxine and Uncle Brown don't tell Troy at first how Carolyn is, but Troy figures out that Carolyn is ill. She visits Carolyn in the hospital, who is weak and ill from cancer. Later, Woody takes Troy home and Troy decides to clean & mop the kitchen without being told. Later that evening, Woody tells the kids that Carolyn's condition is not well and she has to stay in the hospital for more tests. The boys cry, but Troy remains silent. In the next scene, it is presumed that Carolyn succumbed to her illness. Nate and Joseph are walking up some stairs with Troy following behind, singing a Christian song she learned from Viola. Joseph says, ""I hope we don't have to dress up for Mommy's funeral.""As Troy watches television, Aunt Maxine comes in with clothes and shoes for Troy to wear at the funeral. Troy doesn't say anything until Aunt Maxine tries to coax her into putting on the clothes. Troy's response is that her mother would never let her wear polyester. When Woody tells Troy it is time to go to the funeral, Troy tells him she is not going. Woody has a talk with Troy, convincing her to go to church because it's what Carolyn would've wanted.At the house gathering after the funeral, Clinton and Troy have a moment when he tries to get Troy to talk, and holds her hand because she's unresponsive to everyone else around her. Joseph comes inside crying, saying that Snuffy and Right Hand Man are making fun of him saying, ""His mama's dead, his mama's dead"" and they robbed him. Following her mother's wishes to protect her younger brother, Troy goes outside with a baseball bat and hits Snuffy in the head. When Snuffy asks her why she did it, Troy tells him, ""I'm tired of you and Right Hand terrorizing the neighborhood. Go sniff on your own block.""In the middle of the night, Troy is sleeping, but she is restless as she dreams she's hearing her mother's voice shouting. She goes downstairs to tell her mother to please stop fighting only to find that it is her father who is making a lot of noise trying to kill a rat in the kitchen. Woody tells her that her mother is gone and that it's ok to cry. Troy runs to the bathroom and throws up as Woody comes into the bathroom to console her. Troy tells him that she wants to stay with him and not move away with her Aunt Maxine and Uncle Brown. Troy asks Woody if Carolyn was in a lot of pain, and he tells her that she was. Troy states, ""Then it's good that she died so she wouldn't suffer anymore.There are scenes of the neighborhood continuing to play much like the beginning of the movie. Troy is sitting in Carolyn's chair with Joseph sitting on her while she combs his hair the way Carolyn did. Then, Carolyn is sitting the stoop seemingly narrating a letter she wrote to Troy telling her she can't believe that she's 10 now, that she misses her very much, and how she's proud of the way she's growing up. The memory is interrupted when the neighborhood kids come to the window and asks Troy if Joseph can come out and play. Troy tells him not to go far because dinner is almost ready. The last scene is of the neighborhood being watched by Troy as she's looking out the window much like Carolyn used to do.

"Wearing a suit and tie and carrying a suitcase full of records, eager newcomer Tony ""T.T."" Thompson (Dennis Christopher) arrives at State Beach, California, on a bus from Chicago, Illinois, at the height of summer. Inside the local hangout, Duke's Vista del Mar, T.T. listens to the jukebox and introduces himself to the owner, Duke Slusarski (Seymour Cassel), explaining that he is in town to honor his late brother Phil, a jazz musician who dreamed of playing his trumpet by the ocean. Touched by T.T.s spiritual mission, Duke offers the young man a place to stay at his house, but Duke's daughter, Corky (Glynnis O'Connor), is upset about the visitor's intrusion, since she was hoping to spend more time with her father during her last month at the beach before she returns to college. The next morning, Corky and T.T.s interaction begins awkwardly as she undresses in the bathroom to shower, not realizing he is using the toilet.At the local auto shop, Jordy Banks (Todd Susman), a local wealthy snob, shows off his shiny Corvette to local diner waitress Corrine (Alice Playten) and her boyfriend, Earl Fescue (Ned Wynn), the garage's mechanic. As Earl and Corrine admire the sports car, Jordy, who is trying to impress Corrine, offers a bet that if Earl can live in his old Pontiac for the next six weeks until Labor Day, he can have the Corvette; however, if he vacates the Pontiac for any reason, he must give it to Jordy. Confidently, Earl accepts the challenge.At the beach, T.T. stands by in black socks and green shorts, watching Corky and Duke play volleyball. When T.T. introduces himself to local surfers, Rick (John Calvin), Tenner (John Fain) and Mike (Jimmy Van Patten), they ignore him and call him a ""kook"" behind his back. T.T. also meets Fay (Dorothy Tristan), Duke's ex-wife, who owns a bathing suit and clothing store in town. Fay is also close to her former step-daughter, Corky whom they go jogging together on the beach every day.Back at the garage among a crowd of onlookers, a television news team reports on Earl's six-week car-living challenge, as steel bars are welded onto the Pontiac's windows and the doors are sealed.Over the next several weeks as the summer season goes on, Duke tries to help T.T. fit in by buying him appropriate beachwear and showing him how to play volleyball, a sport that Duke compares to sex. He also shares stories about participating in the 1956 summer Olympic Games in Helsinki, Finland, as a swimming athlete. Inspired, T.T. practices volleyball in his room, while Corky continues to ignore him.After smoking marijuana on the beach one day, T.T. goes to the local movie theater. At the crowded concession stand, T.T. becomes aroused by the girls gathered around the counter, and ends up spilling soda on his shirt. In the men's bathroom, T.T. encounters surfers Rick and Mike, and Mike is too intoxicated to stand after being dumped by his girlfriend. After T.T. helps guide Mike to the car, three girls surround T.T. eager to know a friend of the popular surfers, but he keeps his eye on Corky as she leaves the theater.Meanwhile, imprisoned in his Pontiac, Earl follows Jordy and Corrine around town and watches in frustration as they begin to date.In another minor subplot, Rick deals with his girlfriend Stephanie (Tanya Roberts) who wants him to do something more with his life rather than surf all day.For the next lesson in beach life, Duke teaches T.T. about surfing, using an old redwood board. However, when T.T. tries to ride with Rick and the other surfers, he is swallowed by the first wave, and the board rolls ashore without him. Later, Tenner shows T. T. how to surf on a modern board, and eventually T.T. is able to stand up without falling.While driving with Rick and Tenner to a surfing competition at Borrega Beach, Rick advises T.T. that Duke is a fraud, explaining that the 1956 Summer Olympics took place in Melbourne, Australia, not Helsinki (which was in 1952). That night, in the back of Rick's van, an attractive blonde girl seduces T.T.Meanwhile, Stephanie is being pressured by her father to stop seeing Rick and wants her to travel with the family Hawaii for a vacation. However, he agrees with Stephanie to meet Rick at a dinner party in a few nights from now to meet him.The next day, at the competition, T.T. runs into Corky on the pier, but she is unimpressed by his new surfing pals and image. This time, T.T. retaliates by calling her rude, and Corky walks away surprised by his new self-assurance. When Duke approaches and begins to tell another nostalgic story, T.T. ignores him. At the competition, Tenner gets into an accident when he tries surfing under the local pier which results in a broken arm and his surfboard broken as well.Later one evening at his bar, Duke reveals to Fay that he has sold the hangout and plans to sail his boat to Hawaii. When he asks her to join him, she initially hesitates, wishing that he made the offer during their marriage, but realizes she cannot resist and decides to go.Meanwhile, Rick accompanies Stephanie to a party at her parents house where his drunken antics cause him to embarrass himself which leads Stephanie to finally decide that she wants to travel with her family to Hawaii.At Duke's house that same night, Corky begins to pester T.T., insisting that he stop playing his brother's depressing jazz music. Unable to suppress her attraction any longer, Corky follows T.T. to the bedroom and kisses him. They make love for the first time and fall asleep together. The next morning, Duke wakes the naked twosome to share the news about his rekindled romance with Fay, but he embarrasses his daughter and annoys T.T., who confronts him for telling phony stories.Later at a beach volleyball game, Duke plays well in front of Fay and a crowd of onlookers. On the nearby hillside, T.T. is grumpy and keeps his distance. Suddenly, Duke collapses on the beach from a heart attack and dies. Distraught, T.T. remains at the house instead of attending the funeral.Afterward, Corky finds T.T. on the boat and gives him an item that was found in Duke's closet, a certificate from the 1952 Olympics in Helsinki, confirming Duke's competition in the backstroke event, coming in fourth and did not win any medal. Corky says Duke always lied about the year to avoid revealing his age.At the LAX airport, Stephanie is preparing to board a TWA flight to Hawaii with her parents. Rick is tagging along, but soon realizes that Stephanie did not buy a ticket for him when she boards the plane without him, leaving him alone and inconsolable.On his Labor Day deadline, Earl instructs a cement mixer to dump concrete into the Corvette that he has just won from Jordy in the driveway of his house. Corrine, who is still dating Jordy, screams at the site of the beautiful car being ruined, and Earl drives away in his Pontiac laughing.In the final scene, on a somber rainy day, Corky and T.T. say goodbye to Fay as enters a taxi to drive her to the airport as she leaves for Hawaii alone. Walking arm in arm, Corky and T.T. decide to begin a new life together."

"Kamal Kishore Khosla (Anupam Kher) is a middle-class man living in New Delhi. He is a simple man with simple tastes. The film begins with a dream sequence where Khosla sees his death, the irony being that nobody really cares about his demise; instead his children and neighbors are more occupied with banal small talk. Waking up from this nightmare, Khosla goes to visit a site where he has purchased a plot of land to build a house. He is accompanied by his family - wife, younger son Chirauonji Lal a.k.a. Cherry (Parvin Dabas) (who does not like his name and wishes to change it), elder son Balwant a.k.a. Bunty (Ranvir Shorey), and his daughter. Kamal Kishore has invested all of his savings (Rs.3 million) into buying the plot; Cherry is not too interested in his father's future plans of settling together in the new house. He is a software engineer and, although a source of pride for his father, he finds his current lifestyle too drab and has planned to shift to the US by taking up a job there. However, he has not let his family in on his plans. The only person Cherry discusses his plan with are Asif Iqbal (Vinay Pathak), the agent helping him with his passport and visa paperwork. Much later, he shares this with his close friend Meghna (Tara Sharma) - who has a very visible romantic interest in him (one which he does not seem to fully realize) - she, however, feels hurt and angered by his choice to desert her and his family.Just when Cherry reveals his migration plans to his family, who are all disturbed by it, during a routine family visit to their land, they find the plot encroached upon by someone. Probing further reveals that the squatters are part of a property usurping nexus headed by the corrupt and powerful Kishan Khurana (Boman Irani). Upon being urged so by the property dealer who had facilitated the purchase of the plot, Kamal Kishore and Bunty visit Khurana. Khurana places before them, a demand for Rs.1.5 million to vacate the plot, an amount which Khosla neither has nor agrees to pay. Kamal Kishore appeals to authorities and agencies, including the police, lawyers, political parties, NGOs and social activists for help. None of them offers more than to get the amount demanded by Khurana reduced by a few lacs, in exchange for a hefty commission for mediating, of course.Spurred by his father's helplessness, Bunty gets help from a gang of local strongmen (pahalwans) who demolish the boundary walls built by Khurana's men and take possession of the plot back by force. This success is short-lived as the corrupt Khurana has the police in his pocket and Kamal Kishore is arrested on trumped up charges of trespass. Released at Khurana's guileful behest after spending a day in the jail, Khosla's will is broken and pride battered. After the catastrophic event Khosla tells his family (especially Cherry) to avoid taking any further action as he is not capable of fighting back and wants Cherry to concentrate on the job that he's arranging abroad. Cherry discusses the grim situation with Asif Iqbal who is revealed to have been an old partner of Khurana's and who has been cheated by him, usurping Asif's own ancestral land. Asif offers to help the Khoslas with a group of Meghna's friends, and they set up a plan to deceive Khurana. They portray a land (owned by the fisheries department, but which has been vacant since decades) as their own, and seek help of Meghna's mentor, Bapu (Navin Nischol) to portray himself as the owner of the land, who is looking for a buyer. The deal is almost finalized, and Khurana requests to visit the land. With the help of the rest of the theatre group, they manage to create a situation which makes Khurana believe of the authenticity of the land and its owner. They successfully turn the tables on Khurana, and dupe him of Rs 3.5 million in cash. From that money, Kamal Kishore pays the ransom 1.2 million to Khurana and gets possession of his plot back, and the remaining cash is divided equally between Asif and the theatre group.The turmoil suffered throughout by the family and the victory of their efforts stirs emotions that bring Cherry close to Meghna and his family. Cherry scraps his plans of migrating to the US, marries Meghna and settles with his family in their new abode built on their plot. As an additional favor, his father allows him to change his name from Chironji Lal to Chirag. As for Khurana, he is left looking bitter, having finally tasted his own medicine."

"Gaetano Proclo (Jack Weston) is present with his wife's (Kay Ballard) family at her father's deathbed. Her father has never liked his son-in-law and before he dies, asks his son (Jerry Stiller), to kill him. Since theirs is a mob family, Gaetano takes the threat seriously and he runs, asking the cab driver to take him someplace where the Vespucci's will never find him. The cab driver's answer? The Ritz. The Ritz is a typical 70's gay bath house. Here you meet Chris ( F. Murray Abraham), a regular visitor who's on the prowl for the newest and/or hottest guy he can find. Also there's Claude Perkins (Paul B. Price), a chubby-chaser who takes a shine to Gaetano. Unfortunately for Gaetano, the cab driver was in the employ of his in-laws and so he tells them where he went. They send in Michael Brick (Treat Williams) who speaks with a very high voice. Also here is a really bad performer, Googie Gomez (played by the talented Rita Moreno) who is playing the bath houses for now and hoping to hit it big. She vascillates between looking for a producer that she was told would be in the audience (with whom she has a long and uncomfortable history) and decrying the belief of some that she is a drag queen. The result is a grand chase and a lot of laughs in very 70's style."
"On his deathbed Carmine Vespucci's father tells him to ""get Proclo"". With ""the hit"" on, Gaetano tells a cab driver to take him where Carmine can't find him.

"Slightly rotund Gaetano Proclo of Cleveland, Ohio long ago married Vivian Vespucci of the New York mob-tied Vespuccis, the marriage which has never sat well with Vivian's father, the controlling patriarch of the family. On his deathbed, old man Vespucci demands his son Carmine Vespucci kill Gaetano so that Gaetano will not inherit half the family garbage business. Knowing that his brother-in-law is going to kill him, Gaetano goes on the run, hopping into a cab, telling the driver to take him to the last place the mob would look for him. Where the driver takes him is the Ritz, a male bath house. What straight Gaetano doesn't know when he checks in to the Ritz is that it is a gay bath house, something he does not truly figure out until he is well ensconced within the goings-on at the facility that evening. Like many of the men who want anonymity while at the Ritz, Gaetano signs in under an assumed name, he using Carmine's. While Chris, one of the regulars with a penchant for screaming, helps Gaetano navigate the bath house, Gaetano tries to steer clear of a few of the other people at the facility that evening: Claude Perkins, a chubby-chaser chasing chubby Gaetano, Claude who Gaetano does not want to get too close to for a reason beyond the gay issue; Googie Gomez, the heavily accented Hispanic floor show performer who may or may not be a transvestite, who believes Gaetano is a Broadway producer and thus her ticket to stardom; and Michael Brick, a good looking but slightly naive private detective hired by Carmine to locate Gaetano, Michael who has only a description of Gaetano to work from, Gaetano's obvious fake mustache and toupee which dim Michael cannot see through. Further complications and misunderstandings ensue when Carmine arrives on the scene. As Carmine and Michael have never met, Michael believes that Gaetano, using Carmine's name, is his boss rather than the man he is supposed to find. The complications grow even further when Vivian arrives on the scene, knowing that her husband is somewhere in the gay facility, with her assuming he is there on his own volition as a gay man.::Huggo"

"Dr. Ludwig von Saulsbourg is a big city physician whose primary goal is to bilk as much money out of his patients as possible. He has been treating a young woman for four years, he prescribing for her complete rest, darkness and medication, in the process billing her father exorbitant amounts of money for his services. She is not getting any better but worse based on her declining mental state about her health. In reality, she is physically healthy. When the family lawyer, Jamison, advises her father to call in a consulting physician, Dr. von Saulsbourg retaliates by advising him to move her to his expensive sanitarium. The antithesis to Dr. von Saulsbourg is kindhearted Dr. Jackson - affectionately referred to as Dr. Jack by his patients - of small town Magnolia Meadows, he who treats his patients with compassion and understanding. That understanding is knowing what truly ails his patients, which often is nothing physical or medical, and treating them without embarrassing them. When Dr. Jack is called in by Jamison as that consulting physician, he is initially unaware that this case is of the young woman who he met casually and fell in love with at first sight when she passed through Magnolia Meadows. Dr. Jack can see immediately that there is nothing physically wrong with her, and that a little excitement in her life is what is truly needed to rejuvenate her existence. What threatens Dr. Jack being able to help her is his feelings for her - which others may believe makes him an inappropriate person to treat her - and Dr. von Saulsbourg doing whatever he can to hang on to his meal ticket.::Huggo"

"A US congressional committee is in Berlin following World War II to investigate rumors of low morale amongst the American troops patrolling the American quadrant of the city. One of those on the committee is Congresswoman Phoebe Frost, a Republican from Iowa who has a singular focus on work, especially when on a mission. Once in Berlin, she believes the committee's military liaison, Colonel Rufus J.

Specifically, she is concerned about an unofficial report of Erika von Schlütow, a singer at an underground cabaret, who was a high ranking Nazi during the war and whose record is being protected and expunged by a high ranking but unknown American military man. To find out who this military man is, Phoebe enlists the help of Captain John Pringle, a fellow Iowan who she met on her travels in Berlin and who she trusts because of his Iowa heritage. She is however unaware that John is Erika's lover and protector. John does whatever he needs to to keep this secret from Phoebe for the few days she's in town. His measures include pretending to have a romantic interest in her himself. Phoebe comes to her own incorrect conclusion of who is protecting Erika. Erika, on the other hand, has her own agenda which she demonstrates in an encounter with Phoebe.

"In January 2000, Dick Harper (Jim Carrey) has been promoted to Vice President of Communications for the large media corporation Globodyne. The next day, he is asked on a television program in which host Sam Samuels and presidential candidate Ralph Nader call Dick and the company's employees ""perverters of the American dream"" and claim it helps the super-rich get even wealthier. As they speak, Globodyne's stock value falls rapidly; it and its employees' pensions, which are in Globodyne's stock, are soon worthless. Dick arrives home, where his wife Jane (Téa Leoni) tells him that she has quit her job as a travel agent after his promotion to spend more time with their son Billy. Dick breaks the news of the company's failure over the family's dinner, instantly alarming Jane. Despite his attempts, Dick is unable to get another V.P. job; Jane tells him the couple face bankruptcy because their assets are composed entirely of now-worthless Globodyne stock.After accepting the prospect of being poor, Dick and Jane apply for low-paying jobs. After being fired from all local businesses and having their utilities cut off, they are forced to sell off their possessions and take off-the-books jobs to make ends meet; the latter of which leads to Dick being mistakingly deported to Mexico when INS agents raid the factory he is working at.Finally, after receiving 24 hours notice of eviction from their home, they decide to turn to crime. Dick decides to rob a local convenience store but loses his nerve due to the large clerk at the register. After several failed attempts, they rob a head shop. They begin nightly robbing sprees and become more professional; they have soon stolen enough money to pay back the mortgages on their house and car, both of which were about to be repossessed.For their final crime, Dick and Jane decide to rob a local bank by using a crafty and low-key approach during business hours. Dick arrives at the bank in disguise as a businessman with a fake beard and eyeglasses while Jane, in disguise as a grey-haired lady, causes a diversion by feigning a fainting spell to draw attention to herself. Dick then lifts the bank president's master key while he is attending to Jane, and uses it to go into the vault and to quietly walk out with some of the cash in his briefcase; all goes as planned until another couple who used to work for Globodyne, Oz (Carlos Jacott) and Debbie Peterson (Stephnie Weir), make an amateurish attempt to rob the bank by an armed robbery. The Petersons are quickly arrested; Dick and Jane take advantage of the hysteria to evade the police, but fail to steal any money.That evening, after watching news footage of the arrests of the Petersons and of other former Globodyne employees who turned to crime to make ends meet, Dick and Jane Harper decide to give up their life of crime, but Dick finds he is to be indicted for his unwitting role in Globodyne's demise.At the local bar, Dick encounters Frank Bascombe (Richard Jenkins), the former CFO of Globodyne, who is drunk and guilt-ridden. Frank tells Dick the company's crooked CEO Jack McCallister (Alec Baldwin) diverted all of Globodyne's assets and dumped the entire stock, thus ruining the company and its employees while escaping with a $400-million fortune. Frank, who is about to go to prison after a failed attempt to expose McCallister's crimes, has received a $10 million bribe from McCallister in exchange for his silence.After learning about McCallister's scheme, Dick, Jane and Frank decide to take revenge. Frank tells them McCallister plans to transfer his $400 million in bearer bonds to an offshore account. Dick and Jane must intercept the transfer from inside the bank and substitute a fake form, transferring the funds to an account Frank has established. McCallister checks the account number on his transfer and demands it is redone. Dick confronts McCallister and demands that he signs a blank check. Knowing Dick's threats are empty, McCallister writes him a check for $100 and leaves the bank. Dick tells Jane that was his contingency plan; Jane, an art major, can now forge McCallister's signature.The next day, McCallister is mobbed by reporters and former Globodyne employees, all praising him for his generosity. Dick appears, and as McCallister's vice president, hands him a prepared statement, which McCallister reads on live television. McCallister is shocked to announce that he has transferred $400 million to a trust fund to support Globodyne's defunct pension plan in gratitude to his former employees. Dick and Jane lead the cheers from the crowd, while McCallister faces them, unable to expose the two without revealing his own crimes. A news report later shows Dick and Jane delivering pension fund checks to former Globodyne employees, including the now-imprisoned Petersons, while reporting that McCallister's net worth has been reduced to around $2,000.One year later, Dick's family drive a rusty old Volkswagen into the sunset. While Billy is teaching his parents Spanish words, a Bentley containing Dick's friend Garth (John Michael Higgins) approaches. Garth tells Dick he has a new job at a company called Enron.

Four socially troubled 18- year-olds from the south of England go on holiday to Malia.
"Calgary, Alberta, Canada, 1988During the Winter Olympic Games, at 1:00 p.m., Doug Dorsey (D.B. Sweeney) awakes in a panic, late for hockey practice with the U.S. Olympic hockey. As he rushes to dress, he addresses the girl in his bed by her wrong name. Meanwhile, Kate Moseley (Moria Kelley) practices her figure skating routines. Rick Tuttle (Barry Flatman), Kate's coach, criticizes her performance, and Kate complains that her skating partner is inadequate. As Doug races through the team entrance to the ice rink, Kate's father, Jack Moseley (Terry O'Quinn), urges his daughter to apologize to Rick, but Kate ignores his plea. As she rounds a corner in the hallway, Doug runs into her, knocking her down. After a snippy exchange with the haughty figure skater, he continues on, leaving Kate on the floor.That night, Doug scores a goal against the German team, but is deliberately knocked senseless by an opposing player. Meanwhile at her performance, Kate's partner drops her on the ice and looses any chance at a medal. As a result of his accident, Doug loses 18 degrees of peripheral vision in his right eye, and learns from his doctor that he cannot expect to become a professional hockey player.Two years later, 1990.Doug is back in his hometown in Minnesota, working at a factory. After work, he goes to his older brother Walter's (Chris Benson) bar, Dorsey's Penalty Box, to grab a sandwich. Walter is short-handed and asks Doug to help out, but Doug is on his way to an amateur hockey game. Walter follows and tells him that a letter from the Detroit Red Wings has arrived. Even without opening it, the implication is clear: the last professional team that has not already rejected Doug has turned him down.At skating practice, Kate has trouble with her latest partner, her eighth in two years. Her new skating coach, Anton Pamchenko (Roy Dotrice), seeks out Doug Dorsey as a potential partner for Kate. Although disappointed that Anton is not a hockey coach, Doug agrees to a tryout. After a disheartening practice session with the antagonistic Kate, Doug is approached by Jack Moseley, who tells him that Anton Pamchenko is a world-class judge of skating talent and that Doug should be honored to have been selected to try out with Kate, but Jack and his daughter see no future in her skating with a hockey player. Jack hands Doug a check to cover his time, and a return plane ticket home.As Jack ticks off the resumes of 35 potential skaters who have failed to meet Kate's standards, he tosses the bunched up documents at a coal scuttle near his fireplace, and misses every shot. Doug tosses his own resume into the scuttle without looking, and Jack declares it to be a lucky shot. In turn, Doug balls up Jack's check, and bets double or nothing that he'll make the shot. Doug stays and continues practicing with Kate, who humiliates him during their skating rehearsals. However, when he challenges her to play hockey, Kate discovers that the game is more demanding than she thought. In frustration, she swings at the puck as if it were a golf ball, and hits Doug in the nose. When she feels guilty about bringing Doug down, Anton suggests that she has found her new skating partner.After grueling weeks of rehearsals, Doug presents Kate with a Christmas gift of a game sweater worn by famed professional hockey player Bobby Orr, a souvenir he has owned for 15 years. She seems not to know who Bobby Orr is, and Doug attempts to take back his gift, but she insists on keeping it and gives him a copy of the Charles Dickens novel Great Expectations, in return.At her family's New Year's Eve party, Kate introduces Doug to her fiance, Hale Forrester (Dwier Brown), who is visiting from London, England, where he works in finance for Kate's father. When Hale notes that he does not like to see Kate upset, Doug suggests he get a blindfold. Although Kate sticks by Hale's side during the party, she becomes jealous when she see Doug interacting with other women. At midnight upon turning 1991, the party attendees exchange kisses, but when Doug and Kate come together, they give each other an awkward peck on the cheek.Later, as Doug packs to leave the Moseley home for the weekend, Kate comes to his room to give him a videotape of their rehearsals to show his family, and informs him that her father has set aside a hotel suite in Chicago, Illinois, for Doug's family when they attend the final skating competition. From Doug's reaction, it is clear to Kate that he has not told his family about the contest, but he assures her they will be there.At Dorsey's Penalty Box, Walter believes his little brother has been away with the Merchant Marines, but Doug finally admits to the crowd that he has been figure skating. He later explains to his brother that figure skating is tougher than playing hockey, and he will be doing something new and revolutionary. When he returns to rehearsals, Doug rebels against the frilly costumes being designed for the team, and insists on using modern, popular music, instead of a classical piece by Mozart.At a dinner just before the finals, Hale announces his engagement to Kate, and Doug is secretly devastated. As Kate skates solo on her ice rink, she is visited by her old coach, Rick Tuttle, who suggests that Kate should have come to him if she wanted to get back into competition skating, and that she would be better off retiring than appearing in the Nationals with a hockey player. Doug overhears as Kate defends his skating to Tuttle. Later, he asks Kate to remove her engagement ring while they are on the ice, because it is cutting into his hand.Several months later at the U. S. Figure Skating Association finals in Chicago, Kate becomes jealous when Doug has a dalliance with Lorie Peckarovski (Rachelle Ottley), the new skating partner of Kate's former partner, Brian Noonan (Kevin Peeks). Hale realizes that Kate really loves Doug, and leaves town before the competition. At the compulsories, Doug and Kate come in third. The following night, at the long form competition, although their routine is well received by the crowd, Doug and Kate at first fail to qualify for the U.S. Olympic team for the 1992 Winter Olympics, but the team ahead of them in the competition flubs their routine, giving Doug and Kate a default victory.After a night of celebration, Kate lets Doug know that her engagement to Hale is off. She is offended when Doug does not want to take advantage of her while drunk, and kicks him out of her room. Later, Doug drinks alone in his room. Lorie knocks on his door and suggests they ""trade secrets."" The next morning, Kate comes to Doug's room, and is upset when Lorie opens the door. In the face of a presumed unbeatable Russian team, Anton proposes a dramatic routine that will transcend anything done in competition before. With five weeks to go, Kate is reluctant, but Doug accepts the challenge.Several months later in February 1992 at the Winter Olympics in Albertville, France, Doug and Kate perform well in the short-form compulsories, but without passion due to their personal conflicts. Afterward a reporter asks about their coming long-form routine, and while Doug brags about their altered routine, Kate insists the new moves are not ready and will not be attempted.At dinner, Doug and Jack Moseley argue over Kate's unwillingness to do the new routine. Kate intervenes, and takes responsibility for their failure. She had always hoped her father would love her, win or lose, but now she is sorry to have let both Doug and her father down.In the morning, Kate prepares to leave after their routine and retire for good. Before they go on that afternoon, Anton urges Doug and Kate to go out on the ice and enjoy each other. Just as they are about to go out on the ice, Doug confesses his love for Kate. She agrees to do Anton's routine, and they go on to win the Olympic Gold Medal."

"A very successful, wealthy lawyer, Edward Lewis, hires a beautiful and unlikely prostitute, Vivian Ward (Julia Roberts), from Sunset Blvd to bring along to various business events. An attraction developes between the two, and Edward finds it harder and harder to let the infectious, kind-hearted Vivian go.Businessman Edward Lewis (Richard Gere) breaks up with his girlfriend, who doesn't want to be at his ""beck and call"" at a swanky party held by his partner Philip Stuckey, and cuts loose in Stuckey's Lotus. He gets lost and stops along Hollywood Boulevard for directions from hooker Vivenne Ward (Julia Roberts). She charges, gets in and ends up driving him to his hotel in Beverley Hills. He asks her up to his penthouse suite on a whim and pays her to stay all night, although seems uncomfortable at first.The following morning he asks her to stay all week for $3000. He also gives her money for clothes and says she needs to be at his ""beck and call"" with no strings attached. She calls her room-mate Kit (Laura San Giacomo) to leave her money for the rent, and goes shopping on Rodeo Drive for more appropriate clothes. However, snooty saleswomen won't serve her as she is still dressed like a hooker, and she returns to the hotel, where she gets stopped by the hotel manager, Barney (Hector Elizondo). He wants to make it clear that they are making an exception having her at the hotel as Edward is such a special guest. Vivienne gets upset as she still has no outfit for dinner, and Barney helps her, along with coaching her on dinner etiquette. When Edwards returns, he is amazed by Vivienne's new look. The business dinner goes well, but Edward is preoccupied with the deal afterwards.The next day, Vivienne tells him about the experience shoppingt the previous day, and Edward takes her back to spend an obscene amount of money on clothes, leaving her to go back to his work as she is transformed from hooker to lady. She goes back to the shop from the previous day to show them the big mistake they made! Back at hotel, she looks like a genuine guest, but when Edward gets home he is still busy with work, and they take a bath together and talk into the night about their pasts and how they ended up where they are today.The following day, Edward takes Vivienne to the polo. While Vivienne chats to David Morse, the grandson of the man involved in Edward's latest deal, Philip is worried she is a spy. Edward reassures him by telling him how they met, and Philip then comes on to Vivienne. When they return to the hotel, she is furious with Edward for telling him, and plans to leave, but he persuades her to see out the week. Edward leaves work early the next day and takes Vivienne on a date to the Opera in his private jet. She clearly is moved by the music, and says ""If I forget to tell you later, I had a wonderful time tonight"". On returning to the hotel, he falls asleep (the first time we have seen this) while she is getting ready for bed, and she kisses him on the lips - she doesn't do this with clients - and they make love as partners, rather than client and hooker. Over breakfast, Edward offers to put her up in an apartment so he can continue seeing her, but she feels insulted and says this is not the fairytale she wants. He then goes off to work without resolving the situation. Kit comes to the hotel and sees that she has fallen for him, but she denies it.Edward meets Morse, about to close the deal, and changes his mind at the last minute. His time with Vivienne has shown him another way of being - taking time off and enjoying life - and working. He wants to create things rather than just making money. Philip is livid, and goes to the hotel.

Edward gets into the car with the chauffeur that took her home, and rather than going to the airport, he goes to her apartment and climbs up the fire escpae (despite being afraid of heights) with a rose in his mouth, to woo her like in a fairy-story."
"A man in a legal but hurtful business needs an escort for some social events, and hires a beautiful prostitute he meets... only to fall in love.::Anonymous"
"Because of his extreme wealth and suave good looks, Edward Lewis could seemingly have any woman he wants, that committed significant other which he needs on his arm at social events to further how he makes his money as a corporate raider. However, he focuses more on his corporate raiding pursuits with his partner in crime, Philip Stuckey, his lawyer of ten years, than those women, with every significant other he's had in his life feeling neglected and eventually leaving him, this fact about which he is just coming to the realization. In Beverly Hills, Edward, in needing that woman on his arms as he and Philip work toward taking over the company owned by the increasingly insolvent James Morse, decides, based on a chance encounter, to hire Hollywood Boulevard hooker Vivian Ward as his escort for the week 24/7. He does so because he wants to have a professional who would be committed to the work, yet not have any commitments to her after the week is over. Beyond their chance encounter, he also makes this decision because she surprises him about how unhookerish she is in certain respects. Vivian, relatively new to Los Angeles and the business, still has to look and act the part, with Edward, beyond giving her money, leaving her largely to her own devices to do so. So she gets a somewhat unlikely Henry Higgins in Barney Thompson, the manager of the Beverly Wilshire Hotel where Edward is staying. Barney has to draw that fine line of keeping the hotel's upscale clients happy, while maintaining the posh decorum of the upper class, which does not include people coming into the hotel looking for rooms with hourly rates. As Barney and his associates are able to transform Vivian into a Cinderella, the questions become whether Vivian can go back to her Hollywood Boulevard life and whether she does have her Prince Charming beyond this week in the form of Edward or anyone else who truly does see her as Cinderella as opposed to a Hollywood Boulevard streetwalker.::Huggo"

Mr. Smith, believing honesty is the best policy, tells her ""No"" because of the impact on his freedom, which is decidedly the wrong answer.That afternoon, MR. DEEVER comes to see David.

On a rainy night two people enter a coffee shop, a lady and a Mr. Black. Joe, the shop-owner, offers his beef stew, the man only wants black coffee, he moves toward the coffee pot, stopping to offer the lady his beef stew, while she stares at the stranger outside the door. The man outside was in a car parked nearby, he took out his gun, putting it back in its holster, under his raincoat. She insists on just a cup of coffee. The stranger enters, sits at the counter, ordering a cup of coffee, much to the chagrin of Joe, the owner. The woman and Black go over to the record machine, they argue, the raincoat man approaches, the woman kisses him on the cheek, pretending they know each other. The man identifies himself as Ned Stewart, while Joe wants to be paid for the coffee, the lady asks Ned to pay the bill, she will wait outside. The lady meets Mr. Black outside in the rain, he says he has been trying to talk to her for days, he clutches his chest, collapses to the ground. Ned Stewart asks what happened, the lady says she doesn't know, other than, he tried to say something, but instead, went down to the sidewalk. She says she will call for help. Ned comes back in the coffee shop, Joe sends him out back in the direction the woman went. A policeman enters, and goes out the back, there is a gunshot. Joe requests a song from the operator of the record machine.At the police station, Inspector Davis reads the newspaper, three cobra killings, Mr. Grey enters the office, and Davis discusses the killings. Grey says there is only one man able to identify these killers. Inspector of Police, Harry Davis, Homicide Squad, asks for Charlie Chan's help with a wire, remembering Charlie's offer to help, when they both worked a Honolulu beat. Charlie responds to the request with a smile, cancelling his appointments for the next several days.In Davis's office, Chan reviews the case. Three persons are murdered by the bite of cobra fangs. All three victims worked for the Sixth National Bank. The men were bank guards and the girl worked in the posting department. Charlie reminisces with Davis, eight years ago in Shanghai, he arrested a man named Van Horn for bank robbery and murder by cobra bite. It was the first day Japanese bombers flew over Shanghai, Van Horn was a prisoner, badly injured in bombing. Inspector Mainwaring rode with Charlie to the British Police Headquarters to meet Van Horn for the second time. Van Horn had bandages about his head, telling Charlie is being framed. While he was transported to Singapore, he jumped out of the small boat he was being moved. That was the last time Charlie says he heard of Van Horn. He face was badly burned, perhaps greatly changed, but his hair was unusual, a streak of white in very black hair. Charlie explains to Davis, the Sixth National Bank has something very valuable to the American Government, it stores radium. The bank is the distributing center for hospitals, laboratories and factories in this vicinity. He goes on to tell Davis, his plans to visit the bank and the coffee shop.In the bank, assistants Tommy and Birmingham talk foolishly and are followed by a large bank guard, encountering Charlie Chan, who explains to the guard the misgivings of the two helpers. Chan sends the two to the car to wait for him. H.R. Jarvis encounters a woman in the bank, they exchange some words, Jarvis ignores Taylor and Morgan in the bank. Charlie is greeted by Bradford Harris, Vice President of the Bank. Chan explains his business is with the bank's President, Mr. Walter Fletcher; he is lead into the man's office. Greeted by Fletcher, Charlie notices the white streak of hair in the man's otherwise black scalp. Charlie asks Fletcher if he was ever in Shanghai, China. Fletcher responds yes, in 1936 and 1937, for the International Bank Company. Charlie tells he is investigating the deaths of three people, Rafferty, Dunham and Black; he wishes to examine personnel records of these individuals. Fletcher talks to his secretary, Miss Paula Webb, requesting the records of the three dead employees. Charlie also asks to look into safety deposit box number 210. Fletcher says the vault is special, rented by the US Government. Charlie says he works for the government, and has the key in hand to the box. Fletcher introduces Miss Paula Webb to Chan. Charlie greets her, then follows Fletcher to the vault room. Miss Webb telephones the deposit vault room, announcing Fletcher and Chan are coming down to the vault; she hangs up. Chan checks the deposit box, holding his Geiger counter near it, as the needle bounces. He tells Fletcher everything is normal.
Chan is next at the coffee shop, meeting irascible Joe, the owner, who denies knowing the lady and man in his shop, the night they were killed. The lady over the jukebox, identifies the man as Ned Stewart, listed in the phone book as Proprietor, Apex Detective Agency. The three enter Stewart's office, newspapers on desk show he had been reading about the cobra murders. The trio encounter Ned who has his gun drawn on Charlie, telling him he needs to call the police. Chan shows identification, he is the police. They all head to the police station. Steward is seen being grilled by Inspector Davis. Stewart said he was hired over the phone to follow the girl by a Mr. Rogers. Stewart hired Rogers to shadow the girl, who lived at a rooming house, under the name Pauline Webster. She went back to the same address the night Black died, but she had packed up her belongings and left the place by the time Stewart got back there. Stewart received payment for a week of service, and a note from Rogers saying do nothing more about Pauline Webster. The note accompanied a postal money order for payment, which is not traceable. Charlie states the handwriting of the note was an attempt to disguise the sourced author. An inspection of bank personnel signatures might tell us the writer identification. Chan requests Davis to inform the newspapers Mr. Stewart has been arrested for the murder of Samuel Black.Bank guard, John Adams, asks Miss Webb if Mr. Fletcher had seen these headlines, handing her a newspaper, headline reading, private detective held for murder. Webb calls someone. Charlie is in Davis's office, gets phone call to meet the girl tonight, she has information for him. Charlie excuses himself to attend to personal matters. He tells Davis he will see him tonight after he talks with girl. Charlie is assuming it is the same girl in the coffee shop, present when Black collapsed out on the sidewalk. The same girl running through the coffee shop, out the back followed by the policeman shooting his gun.At the café, the girl talks to Chan about the night Black encountered her on the sidewalk. She says he never got to speak to her, he dropped dead before he could speak. Stewart is sitting in the next booth, covered by booth curtains, Chan asks if he recognizes young lady, he says yes. He joins Chan and the lady. Chan introduces young lady as Paula Webb, known to Stewart as Pauline Webster, and she has cleared you of murder charge. Miss Webb, we expect you to come tomorrow to police headquarters to make an affidavit of your statement. Mr. Stewart is to escort charming young lady home. Paula Webb tells Stewart he didn't have anything more to do with Mr. Black's death than I did.Detective Larkin phones from bank requesting Chan and Davis get over there promptly, when they arrive Larkin is gone. Adams, the bank guard by day and night, tells Chan they have searched for Larkin, cannot locate him. Davis tells Fletcher and Harris of Larkin's identity as a police detective. Charlie explains to Davis, Larkin's disappearance will be a mystery which they must solve alone. Inspector will have the architect's plans of the bank building sent in, showing sewers and tunnels. Morgan and Taylor, seen in the bank earlier, both have records, will be picked up, and they will be grilled for information. Tommy and Birmingham bump into Morgan and Taylor on the sidewalk. The two criminals enter the laundry service store, greet Rita, the laundry clerk, heading to the back room. Tommy and Birmingham sneak in the laundry, past Rita, into the back room, discovering a secret entry to the cellar. They venture down into the tunnel, then climb down into the storm sewer.Charlie, Inspector Davis and Stewart are passed by a woman coming of the elevator. She comments they look like someone she knew. Tommy and Birmingham continue through the tunnels. They run into Larkin, who is dead. Morgan and Taylor are now following the sounds of the two assistants. The two criminals shoot at the two assistants, having climbed up a level to the tunnel. Charlie, Davis and Stewart are moving through the tunnel as well; they hear the shots. The two assistants meet up with the three, stating the two criminals started to shoot, so they left in a hurry. The two tell of finding the dead man. Charlie wants to see first-hand. The body is confirmed to be Larkin, telling Charlie what they need to know. Larkin was the fourth person to die by the fangs of the cobra. Larkin's body found outside of bank proved in reverse a way to get into bank without going through the front door. The three prior deaths were common to the coffee shop, which will be visited tomorrow. Now they visit the laundry with mysterious trap door, but the trap door is gone; they all leave. Charlie talks to the letter carrier, finding the laundry moved one door down. The group enters next door, finds the building empty, but the trap door is there. They enter the tunnel, start moving to try and determine how Larkin got from inside the bank to the cellar's tunnels. They find a duct vent leading up to a light. Stewart climbs up the vent, into the office of Fletcher's secretary. Charlie and Davis enter the bank, excuse themselves to Fletcher and Harris, who are not welcome to follow. They meet Stewart, showing them the way he came through the ventilator. Miss Paula comes out of Fletcher's office, surprised to see the men. Fletcher and Harris question how Stewart got there. Chan tells Paula to get her coat and follow the detectives and Stewart.The group confronts Joe, the coffee shop owner. Charlie learns the bank employees frequent his shop. Charlie also learns the jukebox was installed by a guy named Jan Van Horn, per Joe. Joe describes Van Horn as mediocre. Charlie thanks all, instructing them to remain there in the coffee shop. He goes with Davis to the second floor of bank building seeking the girl who's comes from the juke box. Charlie says she walked off the elevator yesterday, her voice sounded strangely familiar. The elevator boy told Charlie she worked in the office of H.R. Jarvis, Chemical Engineer, second floor. They approach the office, hear someone inside, hide around the corner, a man exits, presumably Jarvis. Davis gives Charlie his skeleton key to enter, and comments, slightly illegal. Chan quips back, murder is much more illegal. They enter, walk through to a second room, a chemical laboratory, Charlie dabs his finger in something on the counter, suspects Penta, a very powerful explosive. He wants police chemist to analyze the substance. Girl of voice jukebox works there, so jukebox must be there. He spots an amateur method of concealment, the bookshelf, concealing a hidden room. The woman sitting at the desk is the voice. Charlie operates the television screen, showing Tommy and Birmingham at the coffee shop. The girl says she only works there, knows nothing, or admits nothing. Charlie asks the group, when Mr. Black was there, did he put a coin in the box? Paula says yes, Black did put a coin in, got the wrong number, subsequently, got his money back. Charlie asks the girl, which button did you push to return his money? She pushes a button off to the side. Charlie directs Stewart to push return coin button, but not with finger. He pushes it with a nail file from Paula. A needle comes out of a hole, just below the coin return button. Stewart says Charlie found the cobra, a device in the machine, obviously activated from the girl's machine. She says she didn't touch that lever, it was always Jan Van Horn. The girl says she cannot describe him, because she never saw his face. Charlie questions all the associations with him, yet she never saw his face. He asks her to accompany them to police headquarters. Charlie tells Davis, the girl is not lying, when she says she has not seen Jan Van Horn's face. The inspector thinks otherwise, he plans on holding her for further questioning. Inspector Davis and Charlie Chan agree they have reached an impasse, however, Chan alerted the newspapers government will remove the radium from the bank tomorrow. If thieves believe radium is removed tomorrow, they might try to steal same tonight. Chan requests police be in cars in street outside bank, and are to move in when signaled by him. Charlie excuses himself to see Mr. Fletcher at bank.A man speaks on the phone, everything is ready on this end, he is here now. They are playing into our hands, Morgan, the government is planning on moving the radium in the morning. A great deal of work to make this rocket practical. Morgan says that will sure put a nice hole in the vault. Is everything ready in the tunnel? Morgan says yes. They synchronize watches. The tubes will be put in the rocket at eleven o'clock.Charlie pulls up to bank, meets Mr. Adams, telling him of appointment with Mr. Fletcher. He asks Adams, if he thinks Miss Webb is connected with murder. Adams replies no, not that child. Charlie enters Fletcher's office, asking to open vault. Fletcher says the time lock won't open vault until nine tomorrow. Charlie informs Fletcher, time lock not set for tonight, by my orders. Charlie enters vault with Fletcher, checks on radium with his pocket Geiger counter. Says everything is in order, Adams closes the safety deposit box door, Chan tells Fletcher, we will return to your office. A man walks out of the bank, in front of Charlie's car, appears to be Morgan or Taylor. Tommy spots Taylor. Assumes he is heading for the laundry, to enter the tunnel; he follows.Tommy and Birmingham discover a tied up policeman behind the laundry back-room-door, Taylor is right behind them, gun drawn, he spots the tied-up cop, as the two assistants move through the tunnel. The two hear Taylor approaching, with Morgan, from the opposite direction, they head down to the sewer, Taylor fires his gun in their direction. Morgan tells Taylor to hold it, he drops a bag of Penta down, setting off an explosion. The explosion is heard by Charlie and Fletcher, beneath the bank, they leave to investigate.Charlie enters the tunnel, Fletcher hangs back, warning Chan. Charlie proceeds in tunnel, Morgan and Taylor are setting the explosives, Morgan tells Taylor, I will keep them covered, call Jarvis, tell him to go ahead. Charlie locates Tommy, as more concrete falls, trapping them. The phone operators detect something in the phone lines, it sounds like Morse code. Inspector Davis is called by the operator supervisor. Tommy asks Charlie if the code worked. Charlie answers, it had better, or we are finished. The operator contacts Davis with message, letting the Inspector know to proceed with plan to catch thieves, and they are trapped in sewer from explosion. Davis gets the message, calls all cars to bank.Morgan and Taylor are set to explode the Penta, they have readied. The police enter the tunnel shooting at Morgan and Taylor, as multiple cars have descended upon the bank. Jarvis says five seconds, he ignites the Penta, blowing the safe to the boxes, as police grab him, after the explosion. Davis's men reach Charlie and assistants.Charlie fresh from a change of linen, enters Fletcher's office, explaining to Inspector Davis he has arrested four persons, but he still seeks killer and leader of bank robbers. Fletcher tells Charlie the police said it was a man named Van Horn. Charlie turns to Paula Webb, stating every time Van Horn is mentioned you are frightened, not for self, but for Van Horn. A man named Rogers was worried about you; Mr. Adams is also worried about you, Miss Webb. Fingerprints have been compared with people working in bank to that of Mr. Rogers letter to Mr. Stewart. Adams admits writing the letter. He shows Charlie his wrists, reflective of the burns he received in Shanghai. Affection noticed, by humble detective, between you and Miss Webb. Webb is Adams' daughter, the reason Adams had Stewart follow Webb was to protect her, without her knowing. Adams admits to being Van Horn, he died his hair, had plastic surgery. Webb says Dad never killed anyone or robbed any bank anywhere. Charlie asks why you come here after you escaped? One of the men on the boat had some of the jewels I was accused of stealing in Shanghai, I came to the US following that man, to get to the man who framed me for robbery and murder. Charlie inquires, who was the man you followed? It was Jarvis, replies Van Horn.Charlie continues his deductions, Jarvis took an office in the building, so you got a job in bank. Paula also got a job here. She saw Black talking to Jarvis, so she started following Black at night. Adams or Van Horn hired Stewart to follow her. Charlie tells Van Horn, there was only one man who fully believed you robbed the bank in Shanghai, that man who collected all and the only evidence against you. The only man who disappeared when you escaped, Special Agent Hume of Shanghai. I have a bag of strange powder, which I find on Mr. Jarvis' desk. Chan tosses the bag to Jarvis, VP Harris intercepts, catching the bag with his left hand, warning Chan to be more careful. Chan tells explosive in another bag. You are one who stopped being careful for the first time, you use left hand. Special Agent Hume was also left-handed. When I receive fingerprints from England, I will prove you are that special agent. Harris reaches for lighter in his coat pocket, Chan wrestles it away from him. Police take Harris or Hume away. Charlie declares, at last, Inspector Davis, we have captured the human cobra. Chan demonstrates, two buttons on lighter, one to produce a flame, the other button pushes out two needles, that killed Detective Larkin. Chan pulls the diamond ring from Stewart's pocket, gives it to Adams, while Stewart holds Webb."
Someone is attempting to steal radium stored in a bank. Death by cobra venom connects a number of murders. Charlie investigates.::Ed Stephan <stephan@henson.cc.wwu.edu>
"When three employees of a bank are found murdered with cobra venom, Charlie Chan connects the homicides to a case he had worked in Shanghai in 1937. Even though he arrested the alleged murderer, whom later escaped from the police, Charlie wouldn't be able to recognize him because, at the time of his apprehension, his badly burned face and hands were swathed in bandages. Although Chan believes he is now involved with a gang that is stealing valuable radium from a bank vault, utilizing tunnels that connect to the area sewer system, his new identity remains a mystery. When a detective disguised as a bank guard is found dead in a tunnel by Birmingham, Charlie knows he's on the right track.::duke1029"

"Following the events of the first film, Ben and Junior Healy decide to leave Cold River for a better life in a new town called Mortville, which is, unfortunately, known as the ""divorce capital of the world"" as Ben is greeted by a seemingly endless number of single women when they arrive at their new house, as well as hotshot single dad Aron Burger, who invites Ben and Junior for a welcoming barbecue. After being insulted by Burger and his equally bratty twin daughters, Dolly and Madison, Junior seeks revenge by turning up the barbecue's gas pumps, causing Burger to get blown up in the air and landing in a kiddie pool in the next yard.The next day, Junior begins his new school year at Mortville Elementary, where he runs into his old nemesis, Mr. Peabody, who originally quit his old job and became a school principal to get away from Junior. When Junior breaks wind in front of Peabody, he thinks that Junior is a smart kid and passes him to the sixth grade. Of course, his new teacher Mr. Thorn is not happy that he is saddled with many of his old students again as hardly any of them passed, including hulking but incredibly stupid Murph, who has been in 6th grade for the past 20 years. When Junior steals a answer from a math question intended for Murph, Thorn is somewhat impressed and leaves the room to find something that will make Murph pay more attention. Of course, a chase breaks out all over the classroom between Junior and an angry Murph, ending with Junior taping him up on the blackboard, causing all the teachers and students to run out of the school. Meanwhile, Ben visits the local bank to get a loan approved. The bank's owner and local rich woman LaWanda DuMore observes this from her upstairs office window and orders her assistant Smith to find out everything about him so she can date him. When Ben picks up Junior from school, Murph somehow gets up on the roof and pushes a satellite dish off, crashing on top of Ben and knocking him out. When Ben regains consciousness, he finds himself in the nurse's office greeted and tended to by pretty Annie Young. Of course, her daughter Trixie who knows Junior's face as he shot her balloon with a slingshot the day they moved in, notices him trying to deface a photo of Annie with a black marker and clobbers him.The next night, Junior is not happy when Ben is going out on a date with Debbie, one of the neighborhood's many single women. Ben leaves Junior with a two-faced babysitter named Rhoda. Junior calls Debbie's ex-husband, Voytek, a slob who lives in a messy apartment, eats dog food, and is insanely jealous. Afterward, Voytek shows up at the restaurant and beats Ben with a lead pipe, but when Ben tries to defend himself from Voytek, Debbie punches him out. Back home, Rhoda's boyfriend shows up on his motorcycle, and they go up to Ben's bedroom to have sex. Junior sees Ben's video camera and records it.After returning home, Ben sees several cars parked in his driveway and sees everybody sitting in the front yard watching the projection of the babysitter and her boyfriend having sex on the front of the house. Shortly after, Big Ben arrives at the house, claiming to be on a vacation, but then admits he is on the run from his creditors as he lost his business and all his money. Ben and Junior reluctantly allow him and his dog, Nippy to stay at the house and in Junior's room.The next day, after Junior is sprayed with the fire hose by Trixie, Ben arrives at the nurse's office and it is quite clear to Junior that he has feelings for Annie. Later, Junior tries to impress Ben with his cooking skills but Ben has another date with another single woman named Emily. While Ben gets ready, Junior rigs the doorbell with the electrical wires and soaks the outside doormat with a garden hose, and when Emily rings the doorbell, she gets electrocuted. Ben is shocked at Emily's appearance, and after he closes the door, Emily collapses on the ground.A distraught Ben thinks that Junior is not getting enough attention, and decides to spend more time with him, thinking his behavior will improve. One day, He takes Junior to a water park, a ball game, and finally a carnival, where is unable to ride a popular ride because of his height and after getting snubbed my Murph and Trixie, who uses stilts on her shoes to get on the ride, gets revenge by expanding the ride's speed, causing everybody in and out of the ride to vomit all over the place. Though frustrated with Junior, Ben decides to make a deal with Junior that he will be there for him, providing he will be good from now on.When they get home, they discover their entire house has been redone by LaWanda, who secretly threatens violence to Junior if he tries to come between her and Ben. After discovering his new bedroom has been become a haven for clown toys, Junior sabotages a dinner cooked by LaWanda by putting roaches inside the salad. An angry and betrayed Ben is convinced he has failed as a father and declares Junior cannot be trusted again and LaWanda telling Junior that she plans to marry Ben. During the school's open house, Ben gets a dose of what Annie's daughter is really like when she ties up the kids during a puppet show. Annie cannot believe it and drags Trixie out of the school. As Ben tries to explain to Annie that he can help her, she confesses that Trixie consumes her life and does not have room for any other person and they disappear into the night, but since Ben still has feelings for LaWanda, he accepts her marriage proposal, much to the anger and dismay of Junior. He gets revenge by switching her blood test with a rabid dog and she is sent to the hospital, where Junior switches nose plastic surgery paperwork for LaWanda.That night, Ben and Junior run into Annie and Trixie having dinner at a local pizza place. Unfortunately, the school principal, Mr. Peabody is there with his girlfriend, and they get into a food fight, causing the four to be kicked out and banned from the restaurant, but thanks to this escapade, Junior and Trixie now become friends and must band together to stop LaWanda from marrying Ben. Later that night, Trixie shows up at his house and plan to take a walk to the park monument, the Love Rock, and they bound and gag Big Ben, fearing he will tell his father. Early the next morning, he receives a phone call from an alarmed Annie. They drive to the park where they see Junior and Trixie sleeping on a bench and after embracing, the two couples go their separate ways.At the wedding, Junior is praying that Ben sees LaWanda's nose. However, to his chagrin, he discovers she got almost $400 worth of last-minute plastic surgery done on it. They then go ahead with the ceremony until it is interrupted by Trixie driving a bulldozer into the park containing the Love Rock. It rolls down the aisle as guests scramble to get out of the way. LaWanda firmly stands her ground and puts out a hand to stop it, which it does by crushing her. Defeated at not stopping Trixie in time, Annie arrives and apologizes to Ben for Trixie ruining the wedding, but Ben says the wedding was meant to be ruined. Feeling that both parents have feelings for each other, the two passionately kiss. Though Big Ben tries to persuade his son to marry LaWanda, Ben suggests his father should, much to his joy. To celebrate, Junior slingshots a stuck of dynamite on the wedding cake, causing it to rocket up in the air and splatter all over Big Ben and LaWanda. The movie ends with Ben, Annie, Junior, and Trixie happily walking out of the park."

"Based on the John Irving novel, this film chronicles the life of T S Garp, and his mother, Jenny. Whilst Garp sees himself as a ""serious"" writer, Jenny writes a feminist manifesto at an opportune time, and finds herself as a magnet for all manner of distressed women.::Tony Bowden <t.bowden@qub.ac.uk>"
"T.S. Garp has led an unusual life. Born in 1944 and named after his father, he is the bastard son of opinionated feminist nurse Jenny Fields who wanted a child but not a husband. She got herself pregnant by a hospitalized soldier on his deathbed, he known only to her as Technical Sergeant Garp. As a young adult, Garp, shaped by his upbringing especially his mother's influence, is an aspiring writer and freestyle wrestler. He shows great aptitude in both. His writing inspires his mother to try her hand at it as well, her subject being her greatest curiosity in life which is human sexuality, most specifically male lust and its effect on women. Into Garp's life comes a myriad of Jenny's friends, acquaintances, groupies and advisers, which includes a transsexual ex-football player named Roberta Muldoon, a reformed prostitute, and a group of women who practice self-mutilation all in the name of making a statement. Also into his life comes Helen Holm, the daughter of his wrestling coach. Garp and Helen have a stormy but passionate relationship, the passion based in part on their joint love of literature. Through all these unusual experiences, Garp just wants to find his place in the world which has a different sensibility than him.::Huggo"
An English community gets testy when a refuge family is granted a plot of land on which to grow vegetables.::Anonymous
"Political refugees are given allotments as part of a scheme to help them fit into the local community. Reaction is mixed amongst the allotment holders of Blacktree Road, ruled with a rod of iron by committee chairman and ex-cop Big John, who bullies his son, known as Little John. Mobile phone company employees Carla, a go-getting bitch, and her dim young assistant, Mike, arrive at the allotments, offering five grand for one of the plots to make way for a phone mast. It is obvious that the sacrifice will be made by one of the new-comers. John is not keen for it to be Iranian Ali, because he is a qualified doctor, who gives free advice. However, Ali and his family are arrested as unsuccessful asylum seekers and John turns his attention to the plot given to Kung Sang, a traumatised oriental whose young children tend to communicate on his behalf. John's bullying treatment of his son over the latter's interest in African Miriam, and his strict adherence to the rules - including the introduction of a secret ballot - start to alienate some of the other gardeners, especially ageing free spirit Kenny and his friends. This intensifies in the knowledge that Big John has excluded all the other committee members in his greedy dealings with Carla and coincides with Kung Sang's acceptance by the group as he makes them all a soup from his freshly-grown squashes. Ultimately Big John will regret the use of the secret ballot, as a little international harmony comes to Blacktree Road, along with a new chairman.::don @ minifie-1"
"In the 1930s, jazz guitarist Emmet Ray idolizes Django Reinhardt, faces gangsters and falls in love with a mute woman.::Anonymous"
"A comedic biopic focused on the life of fictional jazz guitarist Emmett Ray. Ray was an irresponsible, free-spending, arrogant, obnoxious, alcohol-abusing, miserable human being, who was also arguably the best guitarist in the world. We follow Ray's life: bouts of getting drunk, his bizzare hobbies of shooting rats and watching passing trains, his dreams of fame and fortune, his strange obsession with the better-known guitarist Django Reinhardt, and of course, playing his beautiful music.::Martin Lewison <mlewison@utk.edu>"
"Mockumentary on Emmet Ray, arguably the second best jazz guitarist of the late 1930s behind French gypsy Django Reinhardt to which Emmet would have agreed. Emmet, in fact, had a morbid fear on many levels of ever meeting Django. Part of the mockumentary includes interviews with those in the know about Emmet, including Woody Allen, whose commentary outlines why he found Emmet a fascinating enough character about who to make a movie. The name Emmet Ray is perhaps obscure today as he only made a few recordings, he not wanting others to be able to copy him by listening to his recordings over and over. Besides being a musical genius, he was extremely irresponsible, having a small stable of whores to finance his lifestyle, including gambling, drinking, womanizing and feeling privileged to have anything he wanted. Those who employed him had to weigh the benefits of the extra customers he would bring in, against he showing up late and/or drunk if at all. He was also an eccentric character, he dropping everything to partake in either of his two favorite pastimes, watching trains go by, or shooting rats at garbage dumps. His life had the potential to be tamed when he met Hattie, a mute laundress, who may have been mentally affected by the childhood disease that took her ability to speak. After a rough start due to communication problems, Emmet grew to have a real affection for Hattie, who in turn was fiercely loyal to him if that loyalty was returned. Their relationship largely had to be on Emmet's terms, including he being the focus. But the possibility of a long term future for them may have been predicated on Emmet getting a glimpse of his life without her.::Huggo"

"Baltimore, Maryland. 1954In the school gym, students file in two lines for Polio vaccines. It is here that the audience is introduced to the main cast. The Drapes: Lenora Frigid (Kim Webb), Drape hussy with a manipulative streak and her eyes set on Cry-Baby, Mona ""Hatchet-Face"" Malnorowski (Kim McGuire), tough as nails, with a face so ugly that it could shatter glass; Wanda Woodward (Traci Lords), obviously the school blond siren in tight clothes and too much make-up; Milton Hackett (Darren E. Burrows), Hatchet-Face's boyfriend, a light-hearted guy with a ever-present smile and a constant joke-maker; Pepper Walker (Ricki Lake), an overweight teenage mother of two and pregnant, rough and tough and loyal; and Wade ""Cry-Baby"" Walker (Johnny Depp), the drape heartthrob that was raised a gentleman by delinquents like himself. His manners and politeness are a step above that of the average Drape; however, he loves his gang and his culture. They're Drapes, and they're proud.Here, we also meet the two main Squares: Allison Vernon-Williams (Amy Locane), a Square with a rebellious side that's 'tired of being good', who, after one moment of eye contact has stolen Cry-Baby's heart, and her Square boyfriend Baldwin (Stephen Mailer), who is jealous and territorial and has two dreams in life: wife-ing up Allison and taking down Cry-Baby and his gang.After the vaccines are administered, the students are released. We meet Wanda's mother and father (Patricia Hearst and David Nelson), the school crossing guard and bus driver, respectively. They're both blissfully ignorant and extremely uncool. Allison introduces herself to Cry-Baby and his friends and Cry-Baby invites Allison to hang out with the Drapes. Allison's grandmother, Mrs. Vernon-Williams (Polly Bergen) and Baldwin show up with the same message for Cry-Baby: stay away from Allison.Though Cry-Baby, born and raised an outlaw, has trouble with listening, and he and his friends tail Allison and her grandmother on the street, driving up beside them and serenading Allison, complete with a blown kiss.After the Vernon-Williams' and Baldwin arrive at the RSVP Charm school, the academy run by Mrs. Vernon-Williams, Baldwin and his Whiffles (Drew Ebersole, Kenny Curtis and Scott Neilson) perform their act in the annual RSVP Talent Show, a lame Doo-Wop song {Sh-Boom}. Afterwards, Allison performs her own song {A Teenage Prayer}. This is where we see her and Baldwin's differing goals in life; while Baldwin watches Allison and imagines her in a wedding dress complete with bouquet and veil, Allison's imagination turns Baldwin and each of the Whiffles into Cry-Baby.Meanwhile, at Turkey Point, the Drape swimming hole (which Mrs. Vernon-Williams ungraciously calls the 'Redneck Riviera'), we meet Milton's parents (Joe Dallesandro and Joey Heatherton), a devout religious couple preaching to the delinquents to repent and accept Jesus into their hearts. As Cry-Baby's gang walks through Turkey Point greeting all their friends, Lenora once again tries to sink her claws into Cry-Baby with a 'CB' burned into her thigh via stickers and sun-bathing. She tells him that she needs a date for that night's Jukebox Jamboree, but Cry-Baby (and his gang) tells her that it's NOT gonna happen.After Cry-Baby's uncle Belvedere (Iggy Pop) and Grandmother Ramona (Susan Tyrrell) gift him with a brand new motorcycle, he travels to the RSVP talent show, politely asking Mrs. Vernon-Williams if Allison can join him at the Jukebox Jamboree at Turkey Point. Mrs. Vernon-Williams reluctantly allows when Cry-Baby shows his poise after Baldwin attacks him.At the Jukebox Jamboree, Pepper, Wanda and Hatchet-Face give Allison a 'bad girl beauty make-over', exchanging her elegant white gown for leather pants and a halter top, complete with a new hairstyle and a face full of make-up. Allison joins Belvedere and Ramona in the audience as Milton, Wanda, Pepper, and Hatchet-Face (as the Cry-Baby Combo) back Cry-Baby for his performance {King Cry-Baby}. Lenora, in true groupie fashion throws her panties at Cry-Baby as he sings, glaring at Allison as she does so. Cry-Baby, however, just kicks them aside before bringing Allison onstage to song with him. Allison sings a line as her 'good girl', and then exchanges it for roaring her second line, bringing her Drape side full circle.After the performance, Allison and Cry-Baby find a spot in a field where Cry-Baby confesses his love for Allison, and give her her first French kiss. Allison talks about her parents' death, telling Cry-Baby she's an orphan. Cry-Baby reveals that his father was The Alphabet Bomber, famous for setting off bombs in alphabetical order (airport, barbershop, car wash, etc.), and that he and Cry-Baby's mother both died in the electric chair.As Cry-Baby and Allison share their family pasts, Baldwin and a group of vengeful Squares sneak into Turkey Point to vandalize the Drapes' cars, Cry-Baby's motorcycle, eventually incite an all-out brawl with the Drapes.Lenora lies to Allison, telling her that she's pregnant with Cry-Baby's child, and Baldwin tells her that the Drapes started everything.All the Drapes, including Allison are arrested and brought to court, where Milton, Hatchet-Face and Wanda are released to their parents and Allison to her grandmother, Ramona and Belvedere are fined $1000 apiece, Peppers kids, Snare-Drum and Susie-Q (Jonathan Benya and Scout Raskin) are put in an orphanage, and Cry-Baby is sentenced to the Maryland Training School for Boys until his 21st birthday.Cry-Baby sings out his longing for Allison on his first night {Teardrops Are Falling}, while Lenora manipulates a clip of Cry-Baby admitting his happiness and pride at being a juvenile delinquent into his pride of being a soon-to-be father by telling the reporters that she's pregnant.Allison hears this on the radio and gives up her Drape style for a floral dress and her Square life once again. Baldwin convinces her to return to him (in the form of a serenade in the director's cut {The Naughty Lady Of Shady Lane}) and Allison says live to reporters that she wants nothing to do with Cry-Baby anymore. Cry-Baby hears this on the radio and gets so angry that he breaks into spontaneous song and dance {Doin' Time For Bein' Young}, which lands him The Hole with his fellow Drape friend, Dupree (Robert Tyree), who gives Cry-Baby a teardrop tattoo for Allison. Cry-Baby uses the sewer in the room to try to escape, unknowingly passing right past Hatchet and Milton, who have stolen a helicopter to break Cry-Baby out, unsuccessfully. Cry-Baby eventually takes a wrong turn that leads him straight to the barbershop of the prison, and straight into the hands of a dozen guards.Meanwhile, Wanda runs away from home after her parents reveal that they've signed her up for an exchange program and she's scheduled to leave for Sweden that afternoon. Pepper, Ramona and Belvedere break all the children out of the inhumane Chatterbox Orphanage and head to the opening of the Enchanted Forest, Maryland's first theme park, and where Baldwin, the Whiffles and Allison are performing {Mr. Sandman}. Allison sees Lenora (now in Square fashion) blow a kiss to Baldwin and smacks him before being told by Cry-Baby's gang that 'she sung with the Squares, now sing with the Drapes'. Baldwin insists that he loves her; Lenora announces that she's now a Square, and Mrs. Vernon-Williams (now warmed up to Cry-Baby and his gang and even sporting a skull and crossbones pin) tells Allison to 'pick the man that loves her the most'.We cut immediately to Cry-Baby's gang and Mrs. Vernon-Williams outside the prison with Allison singing on a hot rod hood in a sexy red dress {Please, Mr. Jailer} vying for Cry-Baby's release from the Judge (Robert Walsh).Cry-Baby is summoned to the visitation room in the nick of time, right before his hair is shaved off. Allison dances for him and they sing to each other, Cry-Baby's need for Allison driving him to shatter the glass separating them, just as the Judge runs in to release him from his sentence.At Cry-Baby's formal release, the Drapes (complete with Mrs. Vernon-Williams) arrive to celebrate and the Squares (complete with Lenora on Baldwin's arm) arrive to jeer.Baldwin reveals that his grandfather was a prison guard, and the one that flipped the switch and electrocuted Cry-Baby's parents.Cry-Baby challenges Baldwin to a game of Chicken with a twist; he and Baldwin on top of the car. Baldwin agrees, and Allison and the Drapes perform a soundtrack to the game {High School Hellcats}.Baldwin chickens out and Cry-Baby wins. Everyone sheds a single tear, except for Cry-Baby, who has finally let go and is able to cry from both eyes."

"Eddie (Sean Penn) is a coke addled casting director who shares home, business and occasionally women with Mickey (Kevin Spacey), and copious women and drugs with two other friends Arty (Garry Shandling) and best buddy Phil (Chazz Palmintieri). Over the course of a couple of days, Arty picks up a waif (Anna Paquin) who they all use shamefully. Mickey and Eddie converse constantly at home at work and by phone, trying vainly to square a love triangle involving Darlene (Robin Wright Penn). Phil meanwhile is an out of work actor who is considering getting his second wife pregnant because it will keep them together and yet is never around for her, prefering to agonise over his ""talent"". Tellingly in one scene Eddie is challenged that he keeps Phil around to remind him he isn't the lowest of the low. Phil clearly loves Eddie and needs his validation but Eddie probably has never actually cast him in anything. Mickey seems happy to stay the cleanest and most together of the four but is cynical and manipulative. A year later the film has moved on but the characters have not (although they probably think they have). Darlene is probably having an affair. Eddie is clean but can fall off the wagon at any moment. Phil is still agonising. Eddie fixes Phil up with Bonnie (Meg Ryan) a good time girl who, it emerges, is another person used and thrown away by the gang. At one point Phil hurls Bonnie out of a moving car - totally caught up in a noir like tough guy psychosis. The location inevitably is Mulholland, later the scene of a car crash that takes Phil leaving Eddie bereft. Before that there is time for Bonnie to return bruised and broken to end up ministering to Eddies emotional need with no one paying any attention to the potentially severe injury she is suffering. Phil returns and he and Eddie start, potentially, to be truthful with each other before lapsing back into philosophising. the boys love for each other takes precedence over and of the women. Phil leaves and returns carrying his own baby that he has kidnapped. The four hand the innocent child around like a toy in a hugely tension filled scene showing their utterly selfish irresponsibility. After Phil's funeral, the final scene is Eddie in the pool potentially drowning himself (not really) only for the abandoned waif, Donna, to reappear and offer him redemption...maybe he will grasp it, but probably not.the four have an amoral view of the world and an inflated sense of their own importance. The film is a scathing commentary about the self indulgence and navel gazing when Hollywood people tell each other shocking lies about how great they all are and then cocaine helps them take each other seriously. Eddie and Phil particularly enjoy cod philosophical explorations of their drug addled psyche, neither understanding the other. Mickey is flip and dismissive of this but is no better at seeing the world without the prism of his own ego. Arty is perhaps the most self conscious because he is a jewish caricature - anxious and apparently wise. The female characters are barely less self indulgent but definitely less well written; ciphers really - this is a buddy movie where none of the characters you'd want to be your buddy."

"Mike lies to his parents about how successful his life is. He meets Lola, a dancer from Mexico, and lies to them that she's his girlfriend. They decide to visit him to meet her, so his friends help him pretend that his lies are true."
"A comedy that spoofs inspirational sports movies, this movie tells the story of an out-of-luck coach, Lambeau Fields, who takes a rag-tag bunch of college misfits and drives them towards the football championships. In the process, this life-long loser discovers that he is a winner after all by redeeming himself, saving his relationship with his family and friends, and finding that there is indeed, no ""I"" in ""team""."
"Lambeau Fields lives a middle-class lifestyle in America along with his wife, Barb, and a gorgeous daughter, Michelle, who he has brought up as a son. Lambeau is a failure and has virtually given up on his career as a football coach. Then his friend, Freddie Wiseman, encourages him to re-enter this field, and he does so by re-locating to Plainfolk in Texas and joins the Heartland State University. It is here he will meet some of the most pathetic players, and quite disillusioned he goes about to find new-comers. He finds a kicker in Jasminder Featherfoot, provided of course, he keeps her involvement secret from the rest of her family. Then he finds Lance Truman, whose drag queen dad has brought him up more like a tom-girl. With these additions and others Lambeau sets forth to include his team in the next Super...Er...Toilet Bowl 2 series, and it is here that he will find that Lance fumbles a lot; Barb is not quite faithful as she seems; he will soon be in jail for Indecent Exposure; Michelle has a black boyfriend; and Freddie has a hidden agenda.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
"Coach Fields is pathetic. He has the distinction of being the worst coach in the history of sports anyone can recall. A loser of enormous proportions, the incompetent and seemingly hopeless coach is convinced by fellow coach Freddie Wiseman to return to the field for one last shot. Assuring his long suffering wife that he will not ignore his family, Coach moves them to Plainfolk, Texas where he hopes to redeem himself and his reputation. Here he begins yet another attempt to improve his abysmal record - this time as the coach of the football team at Heartland State University. But he is saddled with a team of misfits - most of whom don't know the difference between a line of scrimmage and a line at the cafeteria. Coach is in serious need of some real talent to beef up his line-up and finds his number one recruit on the university's baseball diamond. The ever-so-handsome Lance Truman brings with him a distinguished award winning career - albeit for the most dropped balls - as well as determination. Coach convinces Truman to join the team as quarterback, and the young athlete comes on board despite the objection of his father. Wearing jersey #1 is Trotter, the bling-wearing, girl magnet wide receiver who can actually catch and run with the ball, as long as his over-sized ego does not get in the way. The biggest bruiser of the team is Buddy Boy, but he turns out to be more warm and cuddly than the mean sonofabitch that Coach longs for. The rest of the team includes the upbeat and handsome, Aseel Tare, who is always ready for action despite an uncanny tendency for injury; tattooed and angry Jorge Juanson who has a chip on his shoulder, and the delusion of being from the barrio; Jizminder, a beautiful, British-Indian soccer player, who takes on the role of kicker and is the only female player on the otherwise all male squad; and lastly, is the runt of the group, Randy, who is always begging for a chance to play despite his minuscule stature, and lack of any discernible football skills...unless you count moxie. Serving as Coach's right hand man is IPod, although he is often misunderstood, the good-hearted, music listening IPod keeps the team smiling. Although the team and townsfolk are leery of the newcomer's approach, the Coach uses his unorthodox methods to whip this group of rag-tags into shape - both on and off the field. While the audience follows their winding road to the playoffs, the film pokes fun at the clichés and conventions of other sports flicks. And the team does make progress, so much so that they actually make it to the South-Southwest Conference Championship at the 2nd Annual Toilet Bowl. Facing their fiercest opponents yet and yearning to win the big game, The Comebacks face off with the Lone Star State Unbeatables. And as every great sports team has always done, The Comebacks use ingenuity and unorthodox measures in the final showdown where the best team wins.::Fox Atomic"

Assisted by high school music teacher Lloyd Miller, Corky St. Clair, the musical's writer/composer and former New York theater professional (off off off off Broadway) who currently leads the Blaine Community Players, will helm the production. Corky and Lloyd are excited about their 'talented' cast of locals and the production as a whole, Corky and Lloyd who themselves are as untalented and unaware as their cast. Corky and company are especially anticipating the presence of Mort Guffman in the audience on opening night, he a representative of the prestigious New York based Oppenheimer Organization. In Corky's mind, a favorable review from Guffman means that the production is heading to Broadway. Through all the ups and downs and more downs of the pre-production, everyone in Blaine still can't wait for opening night and the arrival of Guffman, upon who the cast and crew's dreams rest.::Huggo"
