"Former vaudeville and burlesque comic Willy Clark (Walter Matthau) is late for a television commercial audition and his agent and nephew Ben Clark (Richard Benjamin) frets as he attempts to keep his uncle's try-out from being canceled. When he finally arrives Ben pleads with the ad agency director to see Willy; but the cantankerous old performer is so unfocused and disagreeable that he ruins any chance he might have had to land the job.Later at Willy's apartment Ben gets blamed for being unable to find work for his uncle. However Ben tells Willy of an offer to do a spot on a upcoming TV special about the history of comedy. The network wants Willy to re-team with his former stage partner Al Lewis (George Burns) and perform their trademark ""Doctor Routine."" Willy refuses claiming he feels betrayed by Lewis who decided to retire. It is revealed here by Willy that he and Al were once a popular vaudeville comedy act known as ""Lewis and Clark"" and also called the Sunshine Boys. After 43 years together they parted ways 11 years ago on unfriendly terms and have not spoken to each other since then. The break-up was due in part to Al's intent to retire and Willy's desire to continue performing.After delicate negotiations in which Ben visits Al in the New Jersey suburbs where he now lives with his daughter's family he persuades Willy to meet Al at his New York City apartment discuss their differences and rehearse the routine. After Ben leaves Al enters and meets Willy for the first time in 11 years. The meeting is a disaster and Al annoys Willy with his old habits. An attempt to rehearse the Doctor Sketch starts with the two grudgingly getting re-acquainted but goes only as far as Al entering the doctor's (Willy's) office before Willy decides to change the scripted long-established ""Come in"" to ""Enter!"" This results in a loud shouting argument and Al's stormy departure.Ben eventually negotiates a detente so the former partners will not have to speak with each other: simply show up for one technical rehearsal on the day of taping and then do the show. Ben tries to salvage the situation despite the objections of Al's daughter to her father being bothered any more about the special and manages to get them in the studio. In the dressing room Al and Willy do not speak to each other as persons just like they did in the last year they did their sketches. There is unpleasantness when Willy carelessly dumps makeup jars on Al followed by Willy's usual trouble with doors in the dressing room.After Phyllis Diller finishes her scene and Steve Allen speaks his introduction the Doctor Sketch starts. The technical rehearsal goes no better than the earlier confrontation in Willy's apartment. It flows smoothly until Willy starts shouting about Al's spitting on him and poking him in the chest. Despite Ben and the staff trying to restore order Willy finally storms off the set shouting accusations and abuse and Al also leaves (finding it impossible to work with the man). In the stairwell Willy's ongoing temper tantrum results in him being felled by a serious heart attack.Even though Willy is allowed no visitors Al comes to the hospital to stand vigil. Later Willy is discharged from the hospital and recovers at his apartment with the assistance of a private nurse that Ben hires. Willy constantly argues and verbally squabbles with the nurse.With the now-frail Willy no longer able to look after himself in his New York apartment Ben and his wife visit the Actors Fund Home in New Jersey and arrange for Willy to move there. When Ben comes to tell Willy about the plan Willy finally lets down his guard enough to express his fear that Ben will no longer make his regular Wednesday visits when he is all the way out in New Jersey. Ben assures his uncle that he will still come by and that Willy will be surrounded by friends and be able to participate with his fellow show business retirees in putting on shows for the residents. As Ben leaves Al shows up for a visit and tells Willy that his daughter is going to be having another baby and the family will need the extra room where he has been living so he has decided to move into the Actors Fund Home. In the final shot as Al talks Willy slumps in his bed with dread. Seemingly joined at the hip for eternity the long-standing feud between Al and Willy will continue."

Chicagoan Nick Conover received a suspended sentence for being caught joyriding in a stolen car with his driver's license suspended indefinitely. Nicky's problems are seen as running around with the wrong crowd. Nicky's sentence is predicated on him living at the run down Kentucky horse farm of his Aunt Henrietta and Uncle Jed Bruce who he hasn't seen since he was a child. The judge figured this more wholesome environment would get Nicky away from his bad influences. Henrietta wants to be a part of Nicky's salvation but Jed doesn't trust the fact of a delinquent being under his roof although he has other more personal reasons not having to do with Nicky for his initially antagonistic relationship with his nephew. Nicky doesn't rebel against farm life but ends up gravitating toward anything mechanical especially the sports car owned by sophisticated Fran Templeton - the elder daughter of Dan Templeton who owns the luxurious neighboring horse farm - and by association Fran herself. With his infatuation with Fran Nicky doesn't see that Fran's younger sister the tomboyish and horse loving Liz Templeton hangs around him because she is falling for him. It isn't until a couple of incidents involving Jed's only remaining horse the spirited Tugfire occur that Nicky begins to see his uncle and Liz in a different light. But Nicky's past catching up with him may get in the way of a Nicky/Liz happy ending.::Huggo

On May 2 1945 RAF pilot Peter Carter returning back to England from a bombing mission over Germany knows that he faces certain death in his plane having been hit and being in flames the rest of his crew who he has already ordered to parachute to safety or have died on board the one in that latter category being his friend Bob Trubshawe. Peter's final words are with a WAC radio operator based in England who he learns is an American named June. In the course of their several minute conversation they fall in love despite knowing Peter's imminent fate. Rather than die in a fiery crash or be incinerated mid-flight Peter decides he'd rather die by ejecting himself from the plane despite having no parachute. Miraculously Peter survives the fall awakening several hours later on the English beach. From his and June's discussion he knows he is near where she lives and is able to locate her the two who instantaneously fall in love in person. The problem is that Peter according to the cosmos was supposed to die the only reason he didn't being the Conductor in the celestial heavens that was supposed to retrieve Peter missed him during the fall in what was the dense English fog this the first such error of a missed body in over a thousand years. Peter and June having fallen in love in the intervening twenty hours between the time Peter was supposed to die and when the error was discovered causes an issue in retrieving Peter now. In the Conductor contacting Peter and Peter only on Earth about taking him to what was supposed to be his rightful place in the heavens Peter indeed protests not so much in fearing death but in his love for June and not wanting to leave her side on Earth. As such he appeals his death sentence which will eventually lead to a trial in the heavens to decide his imminent fate. Beyond preparing for the trial itself Peter also tries to understand in a Earthly sense why he survived and if what he is currently experiencing is real or a fantasy of his own making. With June's help Peter consults with her friend neurologist Dr. Frank Reeves which may have some unintended consequences in taking Earthly human actions to deal with something otherworldly.::Huggo

"The school board meets to welcome Miss Evelyn Togar (Mary Woronov) Vince Lombardi High School's new principal -- the old principal having been driven insane by the unruly students. Riff Randell (P.J. Soles) and her nerdy friend Kate Rambeau (Dey Young) hijack the PA system to play some music (""Sheena Is a Punk Rocker""). Miss Togar interupts the dance party and gives them both detention. Miss Togar then announces to the assembled students that Vince Lombardi High School has the worst academic standing in California. Three principals in a row have suffered nervous breakdowns because the student body cares about nothing but rock and roll music. Miss Togar vows to the students that she will clean up the school and make it a center of learning. Intimidated the kids rush off to their classes.Kate has a crush on the quarterback Tom Roberts (Vincent Van Patten) who has the hots for Riff. Tom is shy with girls -- all he can think of to talk about is the weather -- so rather than ask Riff out he goes to see the school's fixer Eaglebauer (Clint Howard) who has an office in the boys' restroom. Eaglebauer agrees to get Tom a date with Riff. His task becomes complicated the very next day when Kate asks him to get her a date with Tom.Riff an aspiring singer and songwriter has written a song called ""Rock 'n' Roll High School"" for her favorite band the Ramones. Her heart belongs to lead singer Joey Ramone and she hopes that one day she'll be able to give the song to Joey and that the band will record it.Miss Togar sends her two geek minions hall monitors Fritz Hansel (Loren Lester) and Fritz Gretel (Daniel Davies) to summon Mr. McGree (Paul Bartel) the music teacher and Coach Steroid (Alix Elias) the gym teacher to the science lab. Togar has been researching the effects of rock music. She shares her findings with Mr. McGree and Coach Steroid and performs a demonstration: Ramones music played at high decibel levels makes mice explode. Meanwhile the girls' gym class left unsupervised is rocking out to unauthorized music -- Riff singing along to her demo tape of ""Rock 'n' Roll High School"". Fritz Hansel and Fritz Gretel happen by and rat the girls out but before Togar arrives the class goes back to the boring calisthenics they were supposed to be doing.In the girls' locker room Riff announces that the Ramones are coming to town to give a concert and she plans to go. The other girls though enthusiastic can't take time away from school to wait in the ticket line for three days. Riff resolves to get tickets for everyone.At the concert hall Riff is first in line. She sets up a folding lounge chair and settles in to wait. Back at school Kate gives Miss Togar notes with increasingly implausible excuses to cover for Riff's absence: the death of her mother the death of her father and the death of her goldfish. (Hansel and Gretel disprove this excuse by producing the goldfish which seems perfectly healthy until one of them swallows it.) The ticket line gets longer and a groupie Angel Dust (Lynn Farrell) cuts in front of Riff to claim the first place in line. Their argument is interrupted by the arrival of the Ramones in a big old convertible singing ""I Just Want to Have Something to Do."" The band's manager recognizes Angel Dust and invites her to come in with the band much to Riff's chagrin.When the ticket window finally opens Riff buys 100 tickets and later distributes them at school. Miss Togar gets wind of the concert and demands that Riff and Kate surrender their tickets. When they refuse Togar lets the hall monitors take the tickets by force (""body search!""). Disheveled and despondent at the prospect of missing the concert the girls retreat to Riff's house to do homework.Meanwhile Eaglebauer is with Tom in Tom's tricked-out van coaching him on how to ask Riff for a date. Tom calls just as Kate confesses to Riff that she thinks Tom will soon ask her (Kate) out. Kate is furious when Riff agrees to go out with Tom but Riff assures her that she only accepted so she can fix up Tom and Kate.In Riff's car Kate and Riff hear a DJ giving away a pair of Ramones tickets on the radio. Frantic to win the tickets Riff pulls the car over and they pull a man out of a phone booth (the poor guy's proposing to his girlfriend) so they can use the phone. When they hear they've won Riff calls Tom to break their date and the girls rush back to Riff's place to dress for the show.That evening concert-goers file into the club which is growing crowded. The kindly Mr. McGree attends out of curiosity but his outdated idea of cool clubwear (a '50s-era beret and a '60s-era scarf) elicits some snickers. A large white mouse is denied admission -- the staff is afraid the music will cause him to explode -- until he produces a pair of noise-canceling headphones. An Indian chief in full feathered headdress is also attending.Riff and Kate are introduced on stage by the DJ who ran the ticket contest Screamin' Steve Stevens (Don Steele). Offered the chance to say a few words to the crowd and the radio audience (which includes Miss Togar) Riff says ""On behalf of the students from Vince Lombardi High who are here tonight I'd just like to say one thing: Screw you Principal Togar we made it to the concert anyway!""Screamin' Steve tries to get Riff and Kate backstage to meet the band but the Ramones' manager isn't having any and tells Angel Dust the groupie to see the girls back to their seats. The crowd is revved up and shouting ""hey ho! let's go!"" when the band takes the stage to open with ""Blitzkrieg Bop."" Riff has to encourage Kate to get into it but Kate begins to loosen up and enjoy herself during the next song ""Teenage Lobotomy."" During the following number ""California Sun"" Angel attempts to steal the song Riff wrote. Tom who has come to the concert with Eaglebauer chases her and gets hold of the package when Angel trips over a cokehead who's spilled his powder on the floor. Riff offhandedly thanks Tom for his help and runs back to the concert. Tom sees that only Kate really cares about him and they agree to be friends. Back on stage Joey (reading a note from Riff) dedicates the next song ""She's the One"" to Tom and Kate.At the same time Miss Togar's minions Hansel and Gretel crash the concert looking for Riff. Instead they find Angel Dust in the Ramones' dressing room. When Angel Dust mouths off to them they yell ""body search!"" and attack her. Riff eventually gets backstage to give Joey her song.A few days later Miss Togar and several concerned parents hold a rally where they try to burn a pile of Ramones records in front of the school. Riff and Tom throw a bowl of water at the bonfire and at Miss Togar. When most of the students begin to riot the Ramones arrive and all the students cheer for them.

"Julian Noble (Pierce Brosnan) wakes up in bed next to a hooker. He looks in her bag and discovers some purple nail varnish; he paints his toe nails and then burns some documents. Julian walks to a park and sits on a bench in Denver pretending to read a paper. He keeps staring at a Porsche across the road. A young boy asks him if the Porsche is his car. He says his mom thinks Julian is cute. Julian rudely replies ""I don't know anything about that car and I'm only interested in your mother if she lost 20 pounds and 30 years!"" The boy goes away and Julian sees a man getting into the Porsche; he quickly gets up and walks away quickly. When the car explodes Julian doesn't even bother to look.Elsewhere in Denver Danny Wright (Gregg Kinnear) wakes up at 5:45AM with lightening and thunder breaking continually overhead during a terrible storm. He gets up quietly without waking his wife. He goes downstairs and eats breakfast when his wife Bean (Hope Davis) comes down wakened by the storm. They talk about how they will miss each other and Danny replies he will be back in just two days. They embrace and then start to undress for a quickie before he leaves for the airport. Suddenly a tree falls through their roof and they leap to the side before the tree crashes through their kitchen. Danny runs into the Denver airport out of the pouring rain. He meets his business partner. They talk about their upcoming trip and how important it is to their business. They can't afford to miss the plane to Mexico. Coincidentally Julian is on the same flight. The ticket agent asks him how he is and after looking at her cleavage for a lingering moment and at her name tag he replies ""Couldn't be better. But more importantly how are you Genevive?""After they arrive in Mexico City a man walks into a hotel carrying a large metallic briefcase. Julian gets out a taxi and walks into the hotel and after checking in goes into the hotel bar. The man joins him and orders a beer. They talk casually for a minute. Julian asks the bartender whether there are any good and bloody bullfights on on Sunday. The bartender replies there is a good one with a matador from Madrid. The bartender then asks Julian whether he is in town for business or pleasure. Julian replies ""My business is my pleasure"". before the man walks away leaving the briefcase behind next to Julian.Julian takes the suitcase up to his room and opens it. It contains a sniper rifle and pictures of his target. Danny and his partner are leaving the same hotel on the way to their meeting with a prospective client. They are both worried about their presentation. Julian leaves the hotel after them and goes into the city. He goes to a flea market stand where he target shoots in a booth. Three cute teen age school girls watch him. He smiles at them and scores on the first shot. When he misses the second shot. He smiles at the girls and then laughs. The girls giggle at him.Julian's boss Mr. Randy (Phillip Baker Hall) meets him and describes the job. He remarks that the girls might be too pubescent even for him! His boss says the schedule has been moved up and the job has to be completed today. Julian is unhappy. As his boss walks off he shouts back to Julian ""Happy birthday"". Julian appears to ahve forgotten it is his birthday.Julian follows his target in the gun's scope from a high vantage point. He shoots the woman and kills her. Elsewhere Danny and his partner walk joyfully into a bar exclaiming about how brilliant their first pitch to the client went.Julian returns to his hotel room and watches TV bored and lonely. He puts on a large Mexican sombrero and then takes it off annoyed. He calls a number of people and they all hang up on him. He gets really annoyed and decides to head for the brothel.When he returns to the hotel he goes straight to the bar where Danny is also drinking. He orders a margarita and Danny says he looks like he needs one. Julian says how they always taste better in Mexico ""margaritas and cock"". They begin talking and Julian commends Danny for getting back on his feet with his new business deal after being fired from his job suddenly and left struggling. Julian says something rude and Danny is offended. Julian apologizes and they continue to talk. Danny tentatively reveals that he lost his son in an accident and Julian responds with a crude joke about a ""fifteen-inch schlong"" changing the subject. Danny is deeply offended and begins to leave before Julian apologizes. Danny relents and allows Julian to buy him a drink.The next morning Julian walks through the hotel lobby in his tight swim trunks and boots drinking a can of beer drawing stares. He kicks off his boots and jumps in the swimming pool. Underwater he imagines sharks are in the water. At the entrance to the hotel Danny and his partner are upset. The clients now want to hear pitches from other companies. They agree that Danny will remain behind and attempt to secure the contract. Julian sees Danny and apologizes for his rudeness the night before. He tells Danny that he lost his wife while driving drunk. Gaining Danny's sympathy he invites Danny to a bullfight. Danny is initially reluctant but agrees to join him.At the bullfight they both smoke cigars. Danny is amazed by the experience. Julian tells Danny that he doesn't have a proper address that he lives wherever he works. Danny is really suprised and asks what Julian does. Julian says he'd rather not say. Julian then explains to Danny the honour of a bull dying in a bull fight and that the crowd respects the bull. Danny finally persuades Julian to say what he does. Julian asks him to not ""loose his shit"" when he tells him what job he does. Julian says ""sometimes people need to be eliminated. Danny does not believe it and jokes about Julian being a hitman. Julian says ""my handler calls me a facilitator a facilitator of fatalities."" Danny finds this hilarious and does not believe him.Danny humours Julian and says he wants a man in the crowd killed. Julian agrees and they leave the bull ring. They go outside the toilets and Julian explains the ""got-to-pee"" theory. He tells Danny about what to and what not to worry about. He shows Danny the escape routes and picked a lock of a door. Danny is amazed.Julian then empties lighter fluid into a bin full of paper. The man Danny joked about killing got up and went into the toilets. Julian threw a cigarette into the bin and it exploded. The guards immediately ran to put it out. Julian dragged Danny away pulled out a knife and dragged him into the toilets. He goes to the cubicle the man is in. Danny is now scared and begs Julian not to kill him. Julian kicks open the door his knife ready with Danny whimpering. He apologizes to the man and pulls Danny out of the toilets laughing.The two walk down the street together to a little bar. Julian asks Danny a favour. He wants Danny's help with a job and offers to pay $50 000. Danny is revolted by the idea and says no. He changes the subject but Julian changes it back. Danny still says no so Julian walks off in a mood Danny calls him back and Julian just says ""consider me the best cocktail party story you ever met"".That evening Danny heard news that the business deal is now going against him. He sits drinking. Julian comes knocking on the door drunk trying to apologize. The screen goes black and you hear a bottle smash. The screen changes to six months later.There are short clips of Julian having sex drinking and killing people in Vienna Moscow Las Vegas and Sydney. The screen slows down in Budapest where he is meeting Mr Randy. Julian wants to have a break as he feels ""burnt out"" but Mr Randy said he can't otherwise the agency will find a new young assassin. Julian says he is tired and doesn't want to do that job. Mr Randy remarks about a failure in Manila but pleads with him to do that job. Julian reluctantly agrees and goes off to do it.He is on a roof above a crowded square and has his sights set on his target. He is about the pull the trigger when he sees himself cowering. he tries again but collapses.The screen changes to Mr Randy. He is speaking to the messenger of his boss Mr Stick. The messenger says Mr Stick wants Julian dead. Mr Randy is surprised and sad. He says he's only made two mistakes. The messenger walks off.The screen changes again but this time to Denver where Danny and Bean are having sex. All looks well. That evening they are in bed talking about how they love each other and support each other. Tomorrow is the fourth anniversary of their son's death. In the middle of their conversation the doorbell rings. It is late at night so they both run downstairs. Danny look out the door and sees Julian standing there. He lets Julian in and hugs him. He greets Bean and says she's fantastic. Danny asks Julian what he is doing there.Julian replies he doesn't know but Danny and Bean offer him some whisky. They sit down and talk. Julian notices the bull fight ticket framed and on the wall. Julian is touched by this. Bean asks to see Julian's gun. He shows it to her and comments ""My god you are a magnificent woman!"". Julian comments on how good Danny looks and understands that Danny got the job he went to Mexico for. Julian proposes a toast to Bean Danny and himself (""a toast to a dead man"").The three move in to the kitchen and Julian explains how he messed up in Manila and how he was burnt out. He said he drank and had sex but nothing worked. He still felt terrible. He said he had to kill a Copper Wire Executive in a market. His plan was to bump into him and stab him. But as Julian got near to his target. The target turned into a child. He collapsed and woke up in a pile of donkey excrement.Julian then explained how his jobs from then were hot and cold. He explained his mistake in Budapest and said how his bosses now wanted to kill him. Danny is really amazed and asks can't he just apologize. Julian said it is impossible as he only just got out of Budapest alive because Mr Randy let him off.Bean then asked him how he got here. Julian tells her how their home is the only home he knows. That Danny is his only friend. Bean invites Julian to stay the night. Julian asks Danny whether he can dance with Bean. Danny obliges and Julian and Bean dance beautifully together. Bean then makes a comment about having a horrible hangover. Julian tells her a recipe to prevent this from ""the only woman he'd ever loved"" his mother. Danny then knows how Julian lied about his wife. There is a moment of tenseness between them. Julian asks whether they want him to leave but they say ""No"" so he stays.Julian wakes Danny up after they went to bed. He takes him into his rental car. Julian again says he needs Danny's help. He said he had been offered a reprieve from death but needed Danny's help to do it. He couldn't do the job on his own as he was burnt out. He needed Danny to help kill the target. At first Danny says no but after Julian says Danny owes him he obliges.They flew to Arizona together to the race courses to kill the target. Julian gets Danny to open a door to set off the alarm so he could turn off the alarm in the future. He then asks Danny to bump into the target so Julian could have a clear shot. Julian is on the stairwell with a sniper rifle. Danny does his part but Julian is unable to take the shot he breaks down. Danny goes to find him and together they agree that Danny will talk Julian through firing. They are successful in killing the man.The screen then changes to the plane on the way home. Julian says thank you and Danny says it's ok. They talk about what happened the night where Julian was knocking on Danny's hotel room. There is a flashback and we discover what really happened. Danny let Julian in and they began talking. Danny asked Julian to kill his business opponents. Julian says no as he doesn't think Danny is that type of person and knows Danny will regret it. The flashback ends and they are back on the plane. Danny says "" You became my friend that night Julian. You surprised me!"" Julian replied ""I surprised myself."" Julian tells Danny that really he didn't do any assignment and that the person he killed was Mr Stick. Julian killed the guy that was trying to kill him.Bean and Danny when he got back went to the cemetery together and Julian after watching them for a while left leaving only a little piece of information showing that he was going to Greece!"

Beyond that advice Andy has to be the one to take the ultimate step to reality he not only having no practical experience but also no theoretical experience in that he doesn't even watch or have interest in porn or masturbate. Some of the advice he receives centers on the actual woman who should be his first time. Regardless of that advice he decides that the woman he truly wants is Trish a specialty retailer with a somewhat useless bricks and mortar outlet across the street from the electronics store. As Andy pursues then eventually falls for Trish he has to decide how much of his true self he will divulge to her.::Huggo

Ishwarchand Thakur (Amitabh Bachchan) and Sumitra Thakur (Shefali Shah) are a married couple who run a toy factory together. They have a son named Aditya Thakur (Akshay Kumar) who does not have any interest in responsibility or what he wants to do in life. It gets even worse when he elopes with his girlfriend Pooja (Priyanka Chopra) the daughter of Natu (Boman Irani).When Pooja gets pregnant both Ishwar and Sumitra decide to make Aditya realize his responsibilities as he will have to take care of his wife and child. They take drastic measures and throw Aditya out of the house along with Pooja. As a result Aditya and Pooja live in a room at the back of the house in the garden. The force becomes so bad that Aditya begins to hate his father and they do not speak to each other for a long time. At the same time Aditya becomes aware of his role in life.However Ishwar has done all this for a reason and is hiding something. Ishwar is trying to make sure that his son is secure but because he is suffering from lung cancer and he wants his son to be responsible. Aditya succeeds in becoming a responsible man and also finds out the truth about his father when his father comes for his performance on the stage. He steps on the stage but instead he asks the audience to pray to god to give a minute of their lives to keep his father alive until his son's birth. His father is alive until his son is born and he names the baby boy 'Ishwar' after himself and he dies. The movie reaches its climax with Aditya welcoming children at his father's toy factory and playing with an alone disabled boy like Ishwar did at the start of the film with his family there including his toddler Ishwar. The spirit of Ishwar touches Sumitra's flowers in her hair and it reminds her of the old times.
Waqt is the story of a father and a son between whom there is a special bond. Unlike many other father son relationships these two are more like friends; the father being Ishwar Sharawat and his son Aditya .Ishwar is the owner of a toy manufacturing company and is extremely generous and big hearted making sure to spread as much as joy to kids as he can and that is why he makes sure that during the festive season of Diwali he distributes toys to the orphans. On the surface Ishwar's life seems like something every man would crave for; a great and profitable business a loving son and a caring and dutiful wife Sumitra or so it seems. Aditya is in love with Mitali and vice-versa who is the daughter of Nathu. However after the initial problems that occur the two of them finally end up getting married. Ishwar hopes that marriage will make Aditya a more responsible man but he is disappointed. His efforts to turn Aditya into a more responsible individual turn futile. One thing leads to another and Ishwar doesn't have an option but to throw Aditya out of the house. Aditya is shocked that the same doting father is now behaving in this fashion towards him and his now pregnant wife. After the initial problems Aditya takes it upon himself to take care of his wife and his unborn kid. Aditya starts working as freelance stuntman and at the same time prepares for a star search contest. Aditya starts turning into an independent man but the rift in the relationship between him and his father grows. In the climax of the film Aditya has been chosen to participate in the finals of the star search contest and this is where all the reasons of the father's cruel behavior are exposed and this forms the end of the story when the father and son get back together.::Annymous
Ishwar Chandra Thakur never had it so good in his life before. He has a faithful and loving wife in Sumitra who he affectionately calls Sumi; and a good rapport with his only child a son named Aditya who he affectionately calls Adi and a servant named Laxman who is not exactly the brightest star on the horizon. So what if Adi has failed his matriculation exams so what if Adi is unable to secure any job; so what if Adi has no skills whatsoever to land any job; so what if Adi is lazy and a slacker; so what if Adi marries his critic's daughter Pooja; so what if Adi wants to be dependent on him all his life; so what if Adi is about to become a dad....but wait a minute. Why would he let Adi & his children depend on him? Didn't he himself start his life with a mere Rs.35/- didn't he work as a mailman and toy salesman? These thoughts overwhelm both Sumi and Ishwar and they ask Adi to get out of their house and live in the servants' outhouse which they do so. But again Adi reaches a state of vegetation without making any effort to find any employment and it is then Ishwar asks him to pay rent of Rs.1500/ and a Electricity deposit of Rs.5000/- or else even this shelter will be taken away from him. With Pooja pregnant and expecting a baby shortly Adi will really have to come to terms or be out on the streets living on the footpath - with no future prospects whatsoever for him Pooja or his newborn child. But without any skills or education what possibly can Adi do to earn money? And what is the real reason why his dad threw him out of the family home?::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)

Teen-aged Londoner Jesminder Bhamra - Jess for short - is fanatical about football. She even uses a poster of her idol footballer David Beckham as her confidante. Although she only plays in pick-up games in the park with her male friends she is naturally gifted at it. She's spotted by Juliette Paxton - Jules for short - who plays in a local women's league and who talks Jess into coming to try out for her team. Jules has aspirations of playing in the Women's United Soccer Association (WUSA) professional league in the United States. Playing organized sports goes against Jess' traditional Punjabi parents' wants for her - especially her mother's - which are to go to law school and to learn how to cook Punjabi food so that she can attract a nice Punjabi husband. But Jess is determined to play on Jules' team regardless of her parents. Jess sees Jules as having the perfect situation not realizing that Jules also has a mother who doesn't want her daughter to focus so much attention on football but for slightly different reasons. The team's compassionate and sympathetic coach Joe tries to help Jess overcome any of these obstacles in whatever way he can. Jess has to try and reconcile these two aspects of her life especially in the lead up to the final game at which an American scout will be in attendance who may be able to get both Jules and Jess one step closer to playing in the WUSA league if he likes what he sees. The game also unfortunately coincides with the rescheduled wedding of Jess' sister.::Huggo

"Former lawyer Bobby Myers recounts his first foray in the Canadian movie business circa 1979 when the then burgeoning Canadian movie industry was going through some growing pains. He wanted his first project as producer to be told by Canadians about issues close to the Canadian heart. As such he acquired the rights to Lantern Moon a beloved Canadian novel written by Lindsay May Marshall. He quickly realized that producing a movie in Canada especially in acquiring financing required much compromise most specifically casting a big name Hollywood star in the leading role. The star he signs Michael Baytes comes with much baggage. Those compromises lead to many problems between the Canadian vision and the want by some to make the movie more ""American"" especially by ultra-patriotic and paranoid Baytes.

Ben goes to the bar to pay but the owner says their drinks are on the house.""14th arrondissement"" Directed by Alexander Payne.It begins over a black screen as we hear Carol (Margo Martindale) a frumpy middle-aged American living in Denver Colorado get called up to the front of her French class at a local university to talk about her recent trip to Paris which was one of her life-long dreams. The rest of the short is narrated by Carol in her really poor (pronunciation-wise) French. Carol wakes up in her Paris hotel. She discusses the food as some of it good some not so good. She wanders around the city by herself. She takes in all the usual sights and we get the feeling its more out of obligation than anything else as she doesn't seem to get overly-excited by anything. She likes what she sees but seems a little disappointed to not be more impressed. She finally ends up at a park to eat her lunch. As she sits there and watches couples walking past and the children playing she's suddenly overcome with emotion. On the verge of tears she says that this is the moment she fell in love with Paris and felt Paris fall in love with her.The film concludes with a short montage of the characters (Bob and Ben greeting each other at a caf Elijah partying at Liz's apartment Thomas and Francine walking happily down the street Suzanne and Gena toasting each other through their neighboring apartment windows the Montmartre man and woman now a couple Zarka meeting her sister who happens to be Ana and going to a music concert with Francois tagging along etc.) played over that cheery waltz from the trailer.The final shot of the film is the city at night fireworks exploding over the Seine and the Eiffel Tower sparking with lights."

"The year is 1935 (where a car smashes down the title caption in the first of several sight gags throughout the movie). A pet shop owner catches a young boy shoplifting a puppy. To discourage the kid from a life of crime the owner tells a story....The year is 1910. Young Johnny Kelly (Byron Thames) is a poor but honest newsboy in New York City. Johnny beats up Danny Vermin (Georg Olden) in self defense and discovers his mom needs an operation they cannot afford. Since the execution of Johnny's father Killer Kelly his widow Ma Kelly (Maureen Stapleton) has supported Johnny and his younger brother Tommy who is fascinated by the law.Johnny's fight with Vermin attracted the notice of local crime boss Jocko Dundee (Peter Boyle) and Johnny seeing no honest way to earn the money for his mom's operation sees no choice than to do a job for Dundee even though it probably means breaking the law and in doing so ""breaking his mother's heart"". He helps Dundee rob the nightclub belonging to Dundee's rival Roman Moronie (Richard Dimitri). When asked his name Johnny coins the name ""Johnny Dangerously"" but Moronie a malapropist of swearwords never ""forgets a fargin face.""Several years pass by. With his mom's continuing medical problems the adult Johnny (Michael Keaton) goes to work for the Dundee gang full time. He becomes a suave young man with plenty of folding cash. The whole neighborhood including the local Pope (Dom DeLuise) knows that Kelly is really Johnny Dangerously but Johnny's secret identity is carefully concealed from his brother and mother. They think he is a law-abiding nightclub owner. Similarly the gang knows nothing of Johnny's mother and brother. Tommy (Griffin Dunne as an adult) is now in law school with a girlfriend and somewhat of a prighe wants to drop out of law school so he can get a job marry his girlfriend and ""get laid."" With the assistance of a public health film (""Your Testicles and YOU"") Johnny gets him to go back to law school.Johnny comes to Dundee's headquartershe is still involved in a running feud with Moronie find he has taken on two new gang members: Danny Vermin (Joe Piscopo as an adult) and his sidekick Dutch. Danny has lived up to his potential and become a total scumbag with a taste for using opera audiences as shooting galleries with his .88 Magnum pistol. Moronie subtle as always sends a robot with a machine gun to try to knock off the gang. He is not successful and Johnny retaliates by knocking down Moronie's club (which was in need of expansion anyway) with a bomb dropped from a biplane.The two gangs go to war. In the meantime Johnny falls for a young showgirl new to the big city Lil Sheridan (Marilu Henner) who when she meets Johnny for the first time asks him ""Do you know your last name is an adverb?"". They go for a long walk together ending in sexual fireworks.The gang war continues. Moronie sends a plumber to plant explosives in Dundee's toilet. Dundee has a narrow escape and he retires in Johnny's favor. Johnny negotiates a truce with Moronie.(Note: another running gag has Ray Walston playing the owner of a news stand who repeatedly gets knocked out when he is hit on the head by a pile of newspapers being flung from the back of a delivery truck. He temporarily loses one of his primary senses whenever he comes to. At various points throughout the movie his character alternates between blindness deafness and amnesia.)Meanwhile Tommy graduates from law school (Johnny's illicit earnings of course have paid for the tuition). Despite Johnny's efforts to steer him into a law firm he goes to work for the District Attorney's office. A bit miffed that his money should be used to train a crimefighter Johnny is nevertheless not worried for the Chief District Attorney Burr (Danny DeVito) is on his payroll. The D.A. tries to sidetrack Tommy but he becomes a major public figure. After he holds hearings looking into Moronie's activities the rival crime boss is deported to Sweden despite his protests that he's ""not from there.""Against Johnny's orders Burr and Vermin conspire to kill Tommy. Tommy is badly injured but survives. Divining the truth Johnny has Burr killed but this leaves Tommy as the new D.A.Tommy recovers and weds his girlfriend. Vermin discovers that Dangerously is the D.A.'s brotherand Tommy promptly overhears Vermin chortling about it. Tommy confronts Johnny who agrees to quit the life of crime. The gang though is not as eager and suggests Johnny may be turning state's evidence against them. Johnny denies this and goes to turn the evidence against himself to the Crime Commissioner who Vermin has just killed under circumstances that suggest Johnny is the killer. Not only that Vermin steals Johnny's prized bubble gum case (formerly Dundee's cigarette case).Johnny is arrested for murder but says he is innocent and the holder of the case is the guilty party. Tommy tries the case against him. Johnny is found guilty sentenced to the electric chair and sent to death row. But when Vermin congratulates Tommy and Tommy notices that he has Johnny's case he realizes Johnny is innocent. Ma Kelly sucker punches Vermin in the crotch and the cigarette case drops out of the stricken mobster's pocket. Ma Kelly and Tommy realize that ""Johnny didn't do it.""Meanwhile his mom is using her contacts to investigate the murder. She finds the cleaning lady who is a witness to Vermin's presence. When Tommy hits Vermin with a grand jury subpoena Vermin knows that he must kill Tommy.Johnny arrives on Death Row where he receives rock star treatment from the starstruck warden. He receives word of Tommy's danger and plots an escape prevailing on the warden to move up his execution. As he is taken to the chair Johnny assembles what looks like a tommy gun from parts handed to him by inmates. He escapes in a laundry truck driven by Lil.Johnny through a wild and hilarious car chase arrives at the theater where Tommy is to be killed. He shoots and wounds Vermin saving Tommy. The governor pardons Johnny as Vermin is arrested.Back to 1935. The young shoplifter is round eyed. Having taken in the lesson that crime does not pay he is given a kitten by the owner whom is Johnny Kelly a law abiding pet shop owner. Johnny says ""Crime doesn't pay."" The kid goes on his way. Johnny slips off his workclothes and is now dressed in a tux. He heads off in a riotous limo with Lil Sheridan where he has the last line: ""Well... it paid a little!"""

Unca Lou confesses to the campers that this is the last summer for Camp Tamakwa since he feels he can no longer connect with the kids.Later Jack digs a hole near one of the cabins looking for something he buried years before but whatever he is looking for is not where he remembers burying it. While out walking with some of the others Jack is asked why he returned after having been kicked out of camp? He replies that Unca Lou's call reminded him he needed to make amends.That night after a long day Kelly asks Matt if he has fallen out of love with her. He protests that they have come up to the camp to have a good time but she insists they have to work things out between them. She remembers when he used to spend hours saying goodnight to Jennifer when they were kids at camp and she always wished he had been kissing her instead. Matt gives her a perfunctory kiss and tells her to go to bed.In the men's cabin the guys pull another prank on the hapless Brad by sticking his hand in warm water while he sleeps causing him to wet the bed.The next day watching him from afar Jennifer and Beth discuss Jack. Beth mentions that Jack was her husband Rick's best friend and she thinks he is in Alcoholics Anonymous now and that is what he was referring to when he mentioned making amends. Beth also tells Jennifer she has not made love since Rick passed away.In the evening after having sex Gwen suggests to Jamie they could run the camp themselves but he is not interested; and when she suggests that he is afraid of her having a baby he tells her he likes his life and she has 15 years before her biological clock winds down. On the grounds at night Matt runs into Jennifer but she gives him a peck on the cheek and goes off to bed so he won't get into trouble with the camp counselor. Later that night the men ""raid"" the girls' dorm. Matt cannot wake Kelly so he asks Jennifer to join him Jack and Beth outside while Jamie and Gwen stay behind to make love.Meanwhile Beth and Jack go to the boathouse where Beth asks Jack why he was kicked out of camp. He tells her about Sam Grover a junior counselor Unca Lou hired over the phone only to discover when he arrived that Sam was a black man. Lou gave Sam return train fare plus one week's pay and sent him home. Jack says he was forced out because he then took something from Lou designed to take him down a peg over the way he treated Sam Grover.Elsewhere Matt takes Jennifer to an empty cabin and though both realize they should leave they start to kiss only to have Unca Lou burst in on them and escort them back to their dorms.The next day Jack continues to dig for what he buried and Jennifer tells Jack that Beth is interested in him.That night the campers watch a promotional film about the camp shot when they were young attendees. Later Beth and Jack talk by a campfire but when he tries to kiss her Beth tells him she is not interested in him that way. At dinner Matt asks if someone might take over running the camp. The group discusses the idea but the dynamics of their relationships make it clear that is not likely to happen.The following day as the others gather on the dock Gwen rows up in a canoe and takes off the bikini Jamie gave her as a present saying she does not believe the garment shows enough of her body off to his friends. He demands she put on some clothes but Gwen refuses to take orders and he walks away.At night in their dorm Jennifer assures Kelly that although she is lonely she is not trying to steal Matt.The next day Unca Lou admits to Jack that he was wrong to treat Sam Grover the way he did but he chose to send Grover away not because he is a racist but that Unca Lou speculated that other young campers would not react well to a black man being their counselor.When Gwen attempts to return her ring to Jamie he grabs her roughly. Matt intercedes and when Unca Lou sees what is going on he suggests they take their fight to the boxing ring. Although Matt hates boxing and at first takes a beating he knocks Jamie down and wins the fight. Then Kelly puts on Jamie's boxing gloves and challenges her husband telling him he cannot ignore her anymore.As Jack again sets to digging he finally finds what he has been looking for: Unca Lou's silver 1946 Michigan State University Class A Boxing Championship trophy that he stole and buried.Elsewhere Unca Lou takes Beth to the dilapidated ""Everett cabin"" and tells her about Oscar and Claire Everett. When Oscar died he wanted to be ""deep sixed"" in the lake. After wasting the last 15 years of her life alone in the cabin Claire Everett died and wanted to be dropped into the lake to be with her husband. Beth accuses Lou of making up the story but understands it was meant for her.As the final night dance goes on Matt and Kelly reconcile Jamie asks Jennifer to dance Matt reaches an agreement with his cousin Brad to leave their clothing business Beth takes Jack out to look at the stars and seduces him and Gwen asks Stick Coder to dance with her. At one point Brad rushes in and gets everyone to follow him to a raft at the pier to watch Beth and Jack rowing in a canoe. Then in an act of revenge for the tricks they played on him Brad unties the raft and sets all of them adrift. Meanwhile Unca Lou returns to his office and finds the trophy standing on his desk.The next morning as the group boards the boat for home Matt pulls Unca Lou aside to apologize and say that he cannot take over the camp. However Beth and Jack are not on board and when Lou heads back he runs into them. They tell him they want to take over the camp but do not know where they will get the money. He happily gives them the camp for free. The final scene shows Beth and Jack the new owners welcoming a large group of young campers to their new summer camp."

While in the Post Office with her Father Cindy takes some mail to a backroom and finds the Grinch trying to cause havoc in the mail room.

To her surprise the Grinch rescues her.Cindy then decides to investigate more into the Grinch's past and interviews several people including two elderly women who cared for the Grinch as well as town socialite Margaret May-Who and the Mayor both of whom were classmates with the Grinch.From the information she collects the Grinch as a child actually liked Christmas and even had a crush on Margaret. However the Mayor as a child taunted the Grinch about this. The Grinch tries to create a hand-made present for Margaret and shave off his facial hair but the bad shaving job causes the class to laugh at him finally causing him to hate Christmas.

The Grinch agonizes over the decision to attend (partly believing this is a trick) before appearing to the Who's.While at first apprehensive the Grinch appears to be getting into the Christmas spirit until the Mayor proposes to Martha May-Who and offers her a car. The ostentatious gift rouses the ire of the Grinch and he then begins to wreck the celebration causing mayhem and burning down the Christmas tree. Cindy feels terrible that her plan to make the Grinch feel better has been ruined and the Grinch returns to Mt Crumpit.The Grinch feeling worse then ever decides that this year he'll stop Christmas from coming by dressing as Santa and stealing it. Fashioning a sled he and his dog Max return to Who-Ville and make off with all the gifts and festive trimmings. Taking everything to the top of Mt Crumpit he plans to drop it all over the edge.Back in Who-ville everyone is sad and distraught with the Mayor blaming the whole thing on Cindy for inviting the Grinch. Cindy's father proclaims that he actually is proud of his daughter because he's seen that Christmas is not about presents and decorations but about being together. Soon a number of other Who's join in and begin singing.This sound causes the Grinch to pause wondering how they can be so cheerful. As he watches the emotion gets to him and his once shrivelled heart grows 3 sizes. The Grinch then returns the presents to Who-ville and apologizes for his misdeed. At the same time Margaret May-Who tells the Mayor she is rejecting his marriage proposal and that her heart belongs to the Grinch.In the closing of the film the town feast is held with the Grinch carving the Roast Beast.

It opens with a 2001-inspired sequence of primitive humans encountering a TV set leading to the discovery of partying and then of fire. It moves quickly to a playful strip sequence with full nudity (male and female) and a meeting with the police. The first dialogue belongs to Director and star Ken Shapiro as Koko the Clown host of a children's show where 'imagination time' is viewer requested readings of sexual passages from literature. Shapiro also appears as one of the leads in the ""Dealers"" a drug dealing story with a message and as both the Anchor and a correspondent of the Channel 1 news team among other roles. Richard Belzer appears with him often including as Shapiro's sidekick (and the unwitting object of his sexual affection) in the Dealers and in the news as a black transvestite prostitute picked up by the Cultural Correspondent in a color story on the underside of New York. The programming has many other shows and a large number of commercials including a scene involving two pairs of fingers (both belonging to Chevy Chase) walking but not talking: the campaign tag line is ""Let your fingers do it."" There is a also a series of commercials from Uranus Corporation ""Where things come out a bit differently"" one lauding the miracle product ""Brown-25"" another admitting responsibility for the destruction of the ""mighty Mayopac River"" on which their chemical processing plant sits.

"Sidney Bruhl (Caine) is a playwright who is most famous for his mystery thriller ""The Murder Game."" Following the debut of the latest of a series of flops he returns to his home in East Hampton and to his wife Myra (Cannon). He tells her that he's received a play called ""Deathtrap"" from a former student from a playwriting seminar. The play is ready for production and Sidney jokingly suggests that he murder the student and steal the play a joke that becomes more serious when he learns after calling the student that no one else has read the play and no one else has a copy. Sidney invites the student up to Long Island.
The student Clifford Anderson (Reeve) arrives shortly thereafter. Myra who has a heart condition becomes more and more agitated as the evening progresses trying desperately to convince Sidney to work with Clifford on ""Deathtrap"" and share the revenue. Instead Sidney attacks Clifford strangling him with a chain. He forces Myra to help him drag Clifford into the yard to bury him.
Following the burial the Bruhls get a visit from psychic Helga ten Dorp (Worth) who's staying with the Bruhls' neighbors. Helga wanders around the living room and study sensing pain and death in various spots and associated with various prop weapons and handcuffs Sidney has displayed on the wall. She warns Sidney about a man in boots who will attack him. As she prepares for bed Myra continues to be horrified only slowly coming to see something of glamour in Sidney's act. Suddenly Clifford bursts through the bedroom window and beats Sidney with a log. Myra flees and Clifford chases after her until her heart gives out; she collapses and dies. Sidney calmly descends the stairs uninjured and sidles unperturbed to Clifford's side. The men exchange a few words before their feelings emerge. They kiss deeply and passionately. Their plan is a success: Myra is out of the way.
Immediately after Myra's funeral Clifford moves in as Sidney's ""secretary."" Clifford works on a play which he says is about a welfare office but Sidney is suffering from writer's block. Sidney's lawyer Porter (Jones) comes over to settle some of Myra's affairs and notices Clifford is acting oddly about his manuscript pages. Sidney sends Clifford off on a pretext errand and breaks into his desk to read the manuscript. He is horrified to discover that Clifford is writing the true story of Myra's murder as a play called ""Deathtrap."" When confronted Clifford offers to share the work and the credit. Sidney demurs: he wants to be remembered as the man who wrote ""The Murder Game"" not as ""the faggot who knocked off his wife."" When Clifford insists he'll write the play without him Sidney reluctantly capitulates.
A few days later Helga stops by again ostensibly to borrow some candles in case the power goes out in a storm that's blowing in. She meets Clifford and when Sidney returns from a dinner party a few minutes later warns him that Clifford is the man in boots. Sidney assures her that he'll be sending Clifford away and Helga leaves.
Sidney asks Clifford to help him act out some possible bits of business for the play first by resisting a frontal assault then by demonstrating how he might wield an axe. Finally Sidney produces a gun he's secreted for this moment trains it on Clifford and tearfully explains to him that he cannot allow completion of ""Deathtrap"" and can only stop him with a bullet. Sidney bids Clifford good-bye and pulls the trigger.
The gun doesn't go off though because Clifford has taken the bullets to load a different gun that he has at the ready. Now in control again Clifford grabs wrist and leg manacles from the prop wall and has Sidney chain himself to a chair. Clifford tells him that he's going to leave soon but just before will unlock one of Sidney's cuffs to allow time for his escape. Clifford will complete ""Deathtrap"" and if anyone asks deny that it's inspired by Sidney's story. After Clifford exits to pack Sidney slips out of the trick cuffs (once the property of Harry Houdini) and grabs a crossbow off the weapon wall. He stalks Clifford and fells him with a single shot.
There's a body to dispose of now but the storm hits with full force knocking out the power. Before Sidney can find a match to light a candle a fleeting figure scurries through the living room in a flash of lightning. It's Helga fully aware that she's in mortal danger. Sidney finds a knife Helga grabs a gun. Clifford regains consciousness and trips Helga. The gun goes flying and a struggle for it ensues that...
...cuts to the same struggle played live by actors before a full house where ""Clifford"" stabs ""Sidney"" and both die leaving ""Helga"" victorious. The opening night audience erupts in thunderous applause and at the back of the house stands Helga ten Dorp now the author of a hit Broadway play called ""Deathtrap."""
A Broadway playwright puts murder in his plan to take credit for a student's play.::Joyce Kavitsky <Kavitsky@erols.com>
"To make Sidney's slump all the more painful Clifford Anderson a student of one of Sidney's writing seminars has recently sent his mentor a copy of his first attempt at playwrighting for Sidney's review and advice. The play ""Deathtrap"" is a five character two-act thriller so perfect in its construction that as Sidney says ""A gifted director couldn't even hurt it."" Using his penchant for plot and out of his desperate desire to once again be the toast of Broadway Sidney along with Myra cook up an almost unthinkable scheme: They'll lure the would-be playwright to the Bruhl home kill him and market the sure-fire script as Sidney's own. But shortly after Clifford arrives it's clear that things are not what they seem. Even Helga Ten Dorp a nosey psychic from next door and Porter Milgram Sidney's observant attorney can only speculate where the line between truth and deception lies.::Craig C. Bailey"

"The story begins on ""the strangest day"" of Larry Burrows (James Belushi) life consisting of a series of comic and dramatic misadventures.Larry is a businessman having just turned 35. He lives in an incomplete small house in a suburb of a nameless US city with his loyal and supportive wife Ellen (Linda Hamilton). Larry looks forward to having a romantic dinner with Ellen to celebrate his birthday that night but she tells him that she may not make it due to her union meeting.Larry blames all of his life's problems on the fact that he struck out during a key moment of a high school baseball game 20 years earlier which cost his team from winning and left him an outcast among his friends and teammates. Every day Larry wishes he had done things differently and hit that baseball. Things in Larry's life turn from bad to worse when he gets fired by his reprehensible supervisor Niles Pender (Hart Bochner) after discovering a scheme to sell the company under the nose of its owners to a group of naive Japanese investors.As the defeated Larry leaves the office after cleaning out his desk he drives home through a rough part of the city when his car an old Ford LTD station wagon stalls out in a dark alley. Suddenly the pink lights of the ""Universal Joint"" a bar come on. Larry goes inside to call a tow truck and tells bartender Mike (Michael Caine) his troubles. He reviews the day he just had to Mike and tells him that he wishes he'd hit that last pitch out of the park after which Mike fixes him a drink called ""Spilled Milk.""Larry leaves the bar walks home and discovers someone else living in his house which is now fixed up (previously his yard and driveway were muddy and unfinished). Mike appears as a taxi driver and drives him to his ""new"" home a mansion in Forest Hills explaining that he did in fact hit the last pitch and won the game. Mike more or less tells Larry that he is a type of 'guardian angel' known at Mr. Destiny who grants life-altering wishes to those select few whom wonder what their lives would be like if they made a different life-altering choice.After being dropped off Larry soon discovers that Cindy Jo (Renee Russo) the daughter of the owner Leo Hanson (Bill McCutcheon) is his wife and he's the president of his company Liberty Republic Sporting Goods. Being a classic car buff he's shocked to find that he owns a collection of priceless antique automobiles in his garage.At first Larry's new life seems perfect with the large birthday party that Cindy Jo throws for him and happy that he has two young children from his marriage (something that he and Ellen could not have). But soon Larry begins to miss his best friend Clip Metzger (Jon Lovitz) and wife Ellen from his previous life; he also discovers that his alternate self has created many enemies like Jewel Jagger (Courteney Cox) a forklift driver at a company warehouse whom is angry with him over spending less time with her.Larry's problems multiply as he realizes that hitting that home run not only made him popular and well liked but it has also made himself arrogant and shallow. He soon finds himself wishing to be put back into his old life. Larry soon discovers that Clip has a low-level job in the accounting department and Ellen is shop steward (in both realities). Jewel Jagger is now Larry's mistress. Ellen hates Larry (because in this alternate reality he has become greedy and selfish) and he discovers that the union is threatening a walkout due to massive layoffs and increased production since Niles Pender is selling the company in both realities. Seeing Ellen he realizes how much he misses her and agrees to all the union's demands providing Ellen agrees to dinner at his favorite restaurant. She reluctantly agrees and Larry eventually convinces her that they were married in a previous life.Pender after discovering that Larry has agreed to union demands takes revenge on Larry. He first tells both Cindy Jo and Jewel of Larry's dinner date with Ellen. He then plots to kill Larry at the office that night. However Leo Hansen comes to Larry's office to leave him a note that he is fired for cheating on Cindy Jo and Pender thinking it's Larry kills him by beating him with a golf club. As a 'Plan B' Pender then calls Larry to the office and then calls the police where he points out to them that he witnessed Larry killing Leo.As the police attempt to arrest Larry for Leo's murder Larry escapes while the jealous and insane Jewel creates pandimonium outside the building in her attempts to shoot him (and shoots out a number of police cars in the process) and a police chase ensues.Larry attempts to hide out at Ellen's house but she refuses to help him and instead tells Larry that she has gotten back together with her husband. Dejected Larry leaves. Now a fugitive framed for Leo's murder Larry finds himself cornered in a dark alley. As he's about to turn himself in the pink glow of the ""Universal Joint"" bar comes on and Larry runs into the empty bar attempting to remake the ""Spilled Milk"" drink that Mike made before and wishing that he had his old life back and wishing he never hit that home run.The red flashing lights of the police cars outside the bar suddenly become those yellow lights of a tow truck. Suddenly Mike appears back behind the bar and Larry realizes he's back in his old life at the exact same time and day of his 35th birthday. He suddenly remembers that tonight the owners of Liberty Republic are to sign the deal with the Japanese investors. He has Duncan the tow truck driver rush him back to the company headquarters and exposes Pender's scheme just as Leo is about to sign the deal.

In this satire of American society we find ourselves following a little boy Timmy Robinson (K'Sun Ray) through an alternate version of the white-bread 1950s of big shiny cars houses with white picket fences and prejudice except that instead of Blacks there are zombie servants animated by space radiation but kept under control with Zomcon zombie collars. Timmy is delighted with the family's first zombie (Billy Connolly) whom he names Fido although his father Bill Robinson (Dylan Baker) is terrified of zombies. the mother Helen (Carrie-Anne Moss) only acquired the domestic zombie due to social pressure from her neighbors. Bill is only interested in golf and in funeral rights to make sure that they will all stay dead when they die and not become zombies themselves. Fido becomes Timmy's best friend while the neighborhood playboy (Tim Blake Nelson) keeps a beautiful female zombie named Tammy (Sonja Bennett) as his girlfriend. Fido runs afoul of prejudice circumstance hardware faults in the Zomcon collars and neighborhood bullies. Before we are done there is murder and assorted other mayhem zombification a full-scale zombie riot at Zomcon and the death of Timmy's father as a result of the zealous Zomcon security chief's (Henry Czerny) attempt to throw Timmy to the wild zombies beyond the fence to punish him for being attached to a zombie. Fido then rescues Timmy and all's well that ends well. Fido is restored to his family and the widow discovers that she is happier with Fido than with her late emotionally challenged husband.
Space radiation turns dead into Zombies. Zomcon fights zombies and finds ways to pacify and use them. On preteen Timmy's 1950s suburban street all have a zombie doing menial chores. Timmy's zombie becomes his pet/friend and is named Fido.::Scott Filtenborg
In an Earthly world resembling the 1950s a cloud of space radiation has shrouded the planet resulting in the dead becoming zombies that desire live human flesh. A company called Zomcon has been able to control the zombie population. Zombies can be temporarily neutralized by being shot but can only be permanently neutralized by their brain being destroyed. Their ultimate disposal is through cremation or burial the latter which requires decapitation with the head being buried separately from the body. Conversely Zomcon has created the domestication collar when activated and placed on a zombie makes the zombie controllable and thus an eternally productive creature within society. Because all dead initially become zombies the elderly are viewed negatively and suspectly. And all people adult or child learn to shoot to kill to protect society. Zomcon is the go to organization for all things zombie. In the town of Willard the Robinsons - father Bill mother Helen and adolescent son Timmy - are one family who don't own a zombie as a domestic since Bill is afraid of zombies as when he was a child he had to shoot his own zombie father who tried to eat him. Bill has thus become fascinated with funerals to see zombies put away permanently. But Helen feels pressured to get a zombie when Zomcon's new head of security in Willard the officious Jonathan Bottoms moves into the neighborhood with his family. Never having had to deal with a zombie directly Timmy is initially wary of their zombie. But as a lonely child who has no friends and is often bullied Timmy eventually befriends their zombie who he names Fido as he treats the zombie much like a faithful pet dog. Timmy protects Fido at all cost even after Fido due to no fault of its own is implicated in some deaths which creates a mini-wave of loose zombies unknown to Zomcon. But Fido may play a larger role within the family as a companion for Helen who is largely neglected by Bill since he sees human affection as ultimately resulting in such difficult issues as what happened between him and his own father. With Timmy and Helen treating Fido with kindness Fido in turn may prove that not all zombies even when without their domestication collar are out to kill anyone and everyone in their path.::Huggo

"During the film opening we see a man presumably Einstein (Walter Mathau) playing a violin as another man walks past a poster advertising Boyd's comet. We then see Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan) with her fiance James Moreland (Stephen Fry). She's working on some math referring to the comet. He comments that she's babbling when she tries to tell him a story. The scene cuts back and forth with a group of elderly men arguing about whether time exists. Meg and James are in his convertible when it develops engine trouble. We see Einstein discussing with his friends (the elderly men) whether there are 'accidents' and he says ""I do not believe God plays dice with the universe.""Catherine and James pull into a garage where Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) is arguing with his boss Bob (Tony Shalhoub) about the car they hear coming into the shop what make and model it is and what the trouble with it is based on what they can hear. Bob sends out Ed to check because he sees the couple and assumes they're ""college people"" meaning they come from Princeton College. As soon as Ed sees Catherine he falls for her.James obnoxiously asks if someone there can work on a British engine and Ed says ""May I look under the bonnet?"" James reassured by the use of the word 'bonnet' consents. Ed looks at it looks at Catherie and pronounces ""You have no spark."" There's clearly a double meaning here referring to her relationship with James. James insists ""But what's wrong with it?"" and Ed adds ""My guess is that you have a short stroke and premature ignition."" He turns to Meg Ryan and says ""Does it ever feel that way?"" She replies ""I'm sure I don't know what you mean"" but it's clear that she gets the double entendre. Ed says he'll go check with his boss about fixing it and goes in to tell his boss that he's in love that time and space stopped that he could see himself kissing Catherine in the future. Ed tells Catherine that fixing the car will take days and she uses his phone to call a cab giving the cab company and Ed her address for the invoice. In the process she leaves behind a pocket watch. There's a brief moment where you see a hand move the watch under some magazines but whose hand? And is it an accident? Or deliberate? The theme of accident versus deliberate intervention occurs repeatedly in the film.Ed goes to return the pocket watch and discovers that the address is the home of Albert Einstein who is Catherine's uncle. Ed helps Einstein and his friends retrieve a badminton racket and in the process befriends them. It's clear to them that Ed likes Catherine. Einstein sees that his niece is unhappy with her fiance and wonders how to help Ed date her. She will only date a very intelligent man and Ed is an auto mechanic. Ed says ""That's easy lend me your brain for a couple of days."" Einstein gets an idea.Einstein and his three friends hatch a plot to make Catherine think that Ed has developed cold fusion as a way to power a rocket to reach the stars so she'll desire him. They help Ed appear hyper-intelligent helping him present a paper on cold fusion at a symposium and then helping him pass an IQ test administered by Catherine's fiance. Catherine as a mathematician is trying to figure out ""Ed's"" theory on cold fusion but she struggles with it. Ed wants to tell Catherine he's a fake but he can't quite seem to. Einstein and his buddies interfere with Catherine's relationship with James and encourage Ed. James is presented as a sadistic sexually cold man who puts Catherine down subtly.Of course there's always a happily-ever-after ending even though it takes President Eisenhower's appearance in the film a convertible a motorcycle waltz music engineered automotive troubles and a comet to make it all come about."

In a town in rural Pennsylvania the car factory has been shut down leaving the town economically distressed. A Japanese company Assan Motors has purchased the factory but will need to be convinced that it is worth re-opening. Hunt Stevenson goes to Japan to make a presentation to Assan's management and the result is that Assan sends a management team to America and the factory is re-opened although the workers will earn a substantially lower wage than they had before the factory had originally closed. Still Hunt is a hero for having convinced management to re-open.The culture clash is severe as Japanese management demands far more regimentation and output than the workers are used to and unpaid overtime is expected when output falls short of productivity standards. Management has little regard for the workers and the quality of their lives focusing on productivity alone. The workers become agitated and their relationship with management becomes adversarial. Hunt acting as employee liaison tries to smooth things over but is unable and when a worker intentionally knocks over one of the Japanese managers during a company baseball game the situation appears beyond repair.Japanese management sees little point in keeping the factory open until Hunt contends that he can match the production of a Japanese factory in its best month meaning 15000 completed cars. Amused by this contention Japanese management agrees that if this output is reached the factory would remain open and wages would return to the levels in effect prior to the original closing of the factory. Otherwise it would close.Hunt advises the workers of this deal but his announcement is met with incredulity and to appease them he falsely relates that a lesser raise would still be earned if output exceeded 13000 cars. The workers give it a shot but despite working long hours and on weekends they conclude that the goal of 15000 is unattainable and decide to go for the raise that would come if 13000 cars were completed. After attaining this goal the workers walk out on management when a dispute arises. Now Hunt must come clean and tell his town that the made a deal for 15000 cars and that failure would result in no raises which would devastate the town's local economy. Hunt has now gone from hero to goat and his co-workers are furious.Still in the end they put their noses to the grindstone and put their differences with the Japanese managers aside as the senior executive from Japan is coming to check on the state of the factory. When the executive comes by they have fallen slightly short of their 15000 target but the Japanese executive is impressed by the team spirit he sees in the factory. Liking the way that the Americans and Japanese are now working together he decides to keep the factory open and give the full raises and the stage is set for an era of understanding among all those working at the factory.

"The film opens with a telephone operator connecting a call to the Hollywood Hotel. As the opening credits scroll across the screen ""Hooray for Hollywood"" is played by an unseen orchestra. The song continues as the action begins. We see several signs: ""Clark Gable Beware!"" then a trumpet player improvises; ""Kay Francis Here He Comes!"" then a saxophone player plays; ""Leslie Howard Watch Your Step!"" then a trombone player plays a lick; ""Garbo I Tank You Like Him!"" then a string bass player slaps his bass; ""Olivia de Havilland Your Midsummer Nights Dream Is On His Way!"" and then Benny Goodman (himself) improvises on his clarinet (all instrumentalists are members of Goodman's band). The camera reveals that each of these instrumentalists and many other members of the band are in a motorcade with each person in a different car with a different sign plastered on the front of each car. They are parading under police escort to the St. Louis Airport. Once they arrive they continue the song with Georgia (Johnnie Scat Davis) and Alice (Frances Langford) singing the lyrics; then the band members also sing. The band is seeing one of its saxophone players Ronnie Bowers (Dick Powell) off to Hollywood; he has signed a ten-week movie contract with Miracle Pictures; the studio's motto is: ""Miracle Pictures Studio If Its a Good Picture Its a Miracle."" As his plane taxies away from the loading area the band launches into ""California Here I Come.""
The next sequence is a montage of various Hollywood sights as ""Hooray for Hollywood"" plays in the background. Ronnie is met at the airport by Bernie Walton (Allyn Joslyn) from the Miracle Pictures publicity department. The studio photographer takes a couple of shots of his arrival after which he is escorted to the Hollywood Hotel where he'll be staying.
The scene switches to the hotel suite of film star Mona Marshall (Lola Lane) where the famous gossip columnist Louella Parsons (herself) is interviewing Miss Marshall while she is being fitted with a gown to wear to the premier of her newest film. Mona is ranting and raving and thoroughly overacting about everything. She is the prototypical spoiled self-absorbed female movie star. When she learns that someone else has been cast in the lead role of a film she had coveted she refuses to appear at the premier of her film that evening. Instead she and her assistant leave town.
The studio head is in a panic when he learns the star of his film will not appear at the premier. The studio publicity man Bernie comes up with a solution. Hell find a double to stand-in for Mona. After Bernie auditions several women he chooses Virginia Stanton (Rosemary Lane) as Monas substitute (Rosemary and Lola Lane are sisters so there is a definite resemblance). To escort her to the premier he selects Ronnie Bowers the new guy the studio has signed to a short term contract.
Bernie and the studios make-up crew take Virginia to Monas Hollywood Hotel penthouse suite and transform her into a Mona look-a-like. Ronnie is thrilled that his first night in Hollywood he will be escorting the famous Mona Marshall to her film premier. When he gets to the penthouse a call comes from the front desk that Alexander DuPrey (Alan Mowbray) Mona's co-star in ""Glamour Girl"" is coming up to escort her to the premier. Bernie has told the maid not allow anyone except Ronnie into Monas suite. When she hears that DuPrey is coming up she panics. Ronnie however rescues the situation by socking DuPrey to keep him out of Monas suite.
At the premier at Cathay Circle the announcer interviewing the stars as they arrive is future President of the United States a very young Ronald Reagan.
After the premier Ronnie and Mona/Virginia return to the Hollywood Hotel's Orchid Room for a party. As they dance together she tells him shes tired of all the photographs and autograph seekers so they walk out into a garden area where they sit by a fountain pool. As she dunks her toes into the cool water he sings ""I'm Like a Fish Out of Water."" After he sings a chorus she sings as they dance together in the fountain. During this number Monas sister Dot (Mabel Todd) chases Fuzzy (Ted Healy) who is trying to avoid her into the garden where they sing a chorus of the song. Ronnie and Mona/Virginia hide when they see Dot and Fuzzy coming (Virginia is certain Dot will realize that she isnt Mona) and turn on the fountain which soaks both of them. As the song concludes Ronnie and Mona/Virginia kiss.
When Mona reads the morning paper and sees a photo of Virginia posing as her at the premier she explodes. She rushes to the studio and demands they fire both Virginia and Ronnie. When Ronnie arrives for his appointment with the head of the studio Mona storms out of the office and slaps him when he calls her darling. Bernie informs Ronnie that the studio head has fired him. Completely confused Ronnie goes with Bernie to a coffee shop where Virginia is the waitress which confuses Ronnie even more. Before anyone can explain he stalks out of the coffee shop. When he encounters Mona as she is leaving the hotel she slaps him again. Finally Bernie explains to Ronnie that it was Virginia he escorted to the premier. Ronnie and Virginia are out on a sightseeing date when they climb over a hill to the Hollywood Bowl. To illustrate the Bowl's exceptional acoustics Virginia sings ""Silhouetted in the Moonlight"" from the stage while Ronnie remains on the hill.
After being summarily fired Ronnie acquires Fuzzy as his manager. Ronnie and Fuzzy see Benny Goodman Alice and Georgia on a Hollywood street corner and learn that the band has been booked at the Hollywood Hotel.
Ronnie and Fuzzy find work as waiters at Callaghan's a drive-in restaurant. Virginia comes by the drive-in and agrees to wait for Ronnie until he gets off.
The scene switches to the Orchid Room where Benny Goodman introduces the song ""Let That Be a Lesson to You."" Georgia sings the lyrics but suddenly the scene switches back to the drive-in where Ronnie sings a lyric about himself as he serves Virginia a milk shake. Later Virginia and most of the drive-ins customers also join in the song. Dot who also shows up at the drive-in sings a chorus to Fuzzy.
A director from Miracle Studio happens to be a customer at Callaghan's and hears the performance. He tells Ronnie he wants to hire him. Virginia tries to talk Ronnie and Fuzzy out of quitting their waiting jobs but they wont listen.
When Ronnie and Fuzzy arrive at the film location the next day they discover that the director wants Ronnie to dub the singing voice of Alexander DuPrey.
In a rehearsal sequence Benny Goodman and His Orchestra play ""Sing Sing Sing"" which features Gene Krupa's marvelous extended drum solo and solos by Harry James on trumpet and Benny Goodman on clarinet. Then Goodman's quartet (Lionel Hampton on vibes Teddy Wilson on piano Gene Krupa on drums and Goodman on clarinet) plays ""I've Got a Heartful of Music."" At the preview screening of Mona Marshall and Alexander DuPrey's film ""Love & Glory"" Ronnie sings ""I've Hitched My Wagon to a Star"" as DuPrey mouths the lyrics on screen. Even though Ronnie's voice doesn't fit DuPrey everyone is impressed with DuPrey's vocal abilities. Louella Parsons asks him to sing on her radio show. He accepts but later panics when Mona asks whose voice he will use. Ronnie has disappeared and the studio cant locate him. They call Virginia for help and she finds him working as a waiter at Callaghan's drive-in again. Ronnie however doesn't want to dub for DuPrey any more. If he sings he says he wants it to be his face on the screen.
Virginia cooks up an idea. Again posing as Mona Virginia picks up DuPrey to accompany him to Louella's radio program. Fuzzy is the chauffeur and Mona's father Chester (Hugh Herbert) is also along to help. They drive until DuPrey demands he be let out of the car. They gladly let him out but by then it is too late for him to make the radio show.
The CBS broadcast begins with Raymond Paige and His Orchestra (themselves) performing a reprise of ""Silhouetted in the Moonlight."" Jerry Cooper Paige's male vocalist and Alice are the vocal soloists. Next Paige his instrumentalists and a chorus perform ""Dark Eyes"" in their jazz symphonique style. Then Louella Parsons introduces Ronnie and Mona to perform a scene from ""Love & Glory."" During this sequence Ronnie reprises ""I've Hitched My Wagon to a Star.""
Everybody (Ronnie Virginia Georgia Alice Mona Jerry Dot Fuzzy and the chorus) gets involved in the finale ""Sing You Son of a Gun"" which evolves into a final reprise of ""Hooray for Hollywood."""

"By appearing first in a bathrobe Vick the gangster boss is aping the headlines of that era. We were seeing a Mafia chieftain in New York City appearing for his court appearances in a bathrobe trying to cop a plea by appearing insane.

The exception to the rule is Ellen Barkin playing a sexy really hot gangster's moll to Jeff Goldblum's professional hitman.

"Goddard Bolt (Mel Brooks) is the callous CEO of Bolt Enterprises. Bolt shows little regard for other people's needs or for the environment and has his eye on the slum of Los Angeles so he can tear it down. Bolt makes a bet with his biggest rival Vance Crasswell (Jeffrey Tambor) who also has an interest in the property that he can survive on those streets for 30 days. Should Bolt lose Crasswell owns the property but should Bolt win Crasswell will sell it for practically nothing.There are three conditions: #1) Bolt will be completely penniless; #2) He must wear an electronic anklet that will activate if he leaves the boundaries forfeiting the bet if he exceeds 30 seconds out of bounds; #3) At no time can he reveal to any of the slum area residents that he is Goddard Bolt. To add to the look Bolt has his mustache shaved off then Crasswell confiscates his toupee and rips the top pocket of his jacket.Unbeknown to Bolt Crasswell schemes to make Goddard's stay on the streets as bad as possible. Bolt homeless hungry and filthy is befriended by skid-row inhabitants like Sailor (Howard Morris) and Fumes (Theodore Wilson) and given the nickname ""Pepto"" after falling asleep in a crate with a Pepto-Bismol logo on its side. In the process he meets and eventually becomes attracted to Molly (Lesley Ann Warren) a homeless woman who used to be a dancer on Broadway. During a scuffle with two muggers Bolt is pushed out of bounds which activates his anklet. To prevent the ""30-second forfeiture"" Bolt rushes back in which impresses Molly with his supposed bravery as it looks like he is tackling the muggers.Bolt learns a series of important life lessons during his 'adventure' namely that life is not about accomplishments or material success but rather the integrity of the human spirit. However Bolt is unaware that the unscrupulous Crasswell has no intention of honoring their bet. When Crasswell realizes Bolt is honoring the bet fair and square Crasswell bribes Bolt's lawyers into fabricating the story that Bolt had lost his mind and has his property seized. Forced to live on the streets for good and remanded to a free clinic by mistake a drugged Bolt murmurs that ""life stinks"" but Molly implores him to remember small things such as the two of them waltzing that make life livable. Crasswell meanwhile has his own plans for the slum area planning to tear it down as well. Bolt incites Fumes and the other slum residents to stage a mock battle on the ceremony while it is televised. Crasswell attempts to stop Bolt with a steam shovel to which Bolt fights Crasswell in another steam shovel akin to ""dinosaur fights"". When Bolt's shovel has plucked Crasswell and has him hanging by his jacket the scene is freeze-framed into a news report saying that Crasswell in a court case was forced to admit he made a bet with Bolt in order to get him to understand the slum conditions then reneged on the terms. Bolt now in control of the area has plans to renovate it into the ""Bolt Center"" which will give the slum residents employment renovate the tenements into livable homes and give the children a private school financed entirely out of pocket by Goddard Bolt. The news report ends by saying Bolt has married Molly and the press are expecting an extravagant CEO-type event only to then be shown Goddard and Molly taking their wedding vows in a simple chapel in the slum area then driving off in a limousine with a vanity plate ""PEPTO""."

"(This synopsis contains spoilers.)""Bruce Almighty"" is the story of a news reporter named Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) who covers fluff stories for TV news in Buffalo New York. The story opens with Bruce in a bakery spidery hairnet yanked over his forehead diligently reporting on the largest cookie ever baked in Buffalo. At the end of the sequence we are introduced to one of the films running jokes ""That's the way the cookie crumbles.""Racing back to the station Bruce gets caught in traffic and vents his frustration about the fact that his life is in a go-nowhere rut. Arriving late to an important meeting fellow staffers--including nemesis Evan Baxter (Steve Carrell)--needle Bruce mercilessly about his clownish coverage at the bakery further exacerbating his bitterness about being stalled on his career path. In the exchange with Evan we see that Bruce has a lively but dark sense of humor and won't take anything lying down. After the meeting Bruce begs his boss Jack Baylor (Philip Baker Hall) to consider him for the open anchor position.Later that night Bruce watches the news with his live-in girlfriend Grace Connelly (Jennifer Aniston) at a middle-class but homey one-bedroom apartment. Sitting on the couch with their dog Grace tries unsuccessfully to enlist Bruce's help with a photo album commemorating highlights of their relationship but Bruce is too preoccupied with feeling sorry for himself until he happens upon an x-rated photo of them making love and whisks Grace off to the bedroom.The next morning Bruce drops Grace off at the Red Cross to give blood. He's still in a bad mood so she gives him her prayer beads saying he needs them more than she does. Bruce reluctantly takes the prayer beads which are useless to him since he never prays and makes fun of Grace for wasting her time giving blood.At the station Bruce learns he's being sent into the field to cover an important story at Niagara Falls assuming from this apparent promotion that he is in line for the anchor position that just opened up. The producer sets the scene in front of the spectacular falls with Bruce in a comical umbrella hat interviewing an elderly woman about early days at Niagara.Surrounded by the tremendous rushing of the falls Bruce is interrupted mid-interview for a big announcement from the station waiting breathlessly to hear that he got anchor. Instead the position is awarded to Evan and Bruce has a serious meltdown in front of the camera repeatedly insulting Evan verbally abusing the two interviewees and then capping off his report with the statement ""Back to you fuckers!"" Needless to say the network fires Bruce and he is thrown out on the street with all his stuff including a framed photograph of Walter Cronkite. Bruce responds with another of his running jokes the sarcastic remark ""B-E-A-utiful!""Bruce arrives home late to dinner and picks a fight with Grace who tries her best to appease him. In a rage at life he turns on her calling their life together mediocre. She takes it personally which inflames him all the more and he slams out of the apartment yelling ""The worst day of my life with a side order of GUILT please!""Increasingly furious Bruce goes for a drive shaking the prayer beads and cursing heaven. It's raining hard as he gets out of the car lost in the turmoil of his feelings continuing to berate God crossing the highway without regard for oncoming traffic to toss the prayer beads as far out into the lake as he can.Back at the apartment next morning Bruce's beeper starts to go off repeatedly with a high-pitched shriek. He doesn't recognize the number and finally gets so annoyed that he tosses the beeper out into the street where it gets run over by a car. The dog who is not housebroken pees on a chair so Bruce takes him outside only to hear the flattened beeper still going off in the middle of the street.Aggravated beyond words and unable to stop the beeper from going off Bruce calls the number and listens to a tape recording of someone who apparently knows everything that's going on in his life. Intrigued he drives to the address he got over the phone finding himself in Buffalo's warehouse district.Bruce gets out of car to look for the address stepping in a huge filthy puddle that splashes all over his jeans. He enters a warehouse to find that the ground floor is empty except for an African-American janitor (Morgan Freeman) mopping the floor. Bruce asks for directions to room seven on the seventh floor finding much to his annoyance that the elevator doesn't work. As he heads for the stairs the janitor asks him to help mop the floor and Bruce retorts that he would be happy to help in seven days at seven o'clock.Arriving on the seventh floor Bruce finds himself in a huge empty room that's painted stark white. As he calls out for help the janitor climbs down a ladder through a hole in the ceiling connected to a brightly lighted room above. Bruce think the janitor must have taken the elevator to get there ahead of him and watches while he strips off his coveralls and sits down behind a white desk impeccably dressed in a white suit and tie disclosing--much to Bruce's amusement--that he is in fact God.God proceeds to prove his powers by showing Bruce a file cabinet that contains everything that ever happened in his life. The drawer is so long that it pushes Bruce all the way across the room then slams shut again dragging Bruce along behind. Bruce is still sceptical so he and God play a game where God guesses how many fingers Bruce will hold up. Bruce is finally convinced that something strange is going on when he holds up one hand with seven fingers just as God says ""Seven.""God has a plan for Bruce. Since Bruce thinks God isn't doing a very good job he will give Bruce all his powers and see if Bruce can do any better. God retreats to his ladder clapping for the lights to go back on so he can climb back up. ""Clap on clap on"" is another joke that repeats throughout the film. Bruce makes a quick exit not believing a word of what this self-proclaimed God has told him.Outside in the street Bruce finds that he can walk across the puddle that tripped him up earlier. His car won't start until he bangs his hands on the steering wheel and yells ""Start!"" As he drives he realizes that all his fantasies--such as for example being Clint Eastwood---easily come true.Bruce stops at a diner to order coffee and the waitress convinces him to add an order of tomato soup. He agrees then decides to try out parting the Red Sea with his bowl of soup. The soup parts in two Bruce's hair flies about amazing another customer. God appears out of nowhere sitting in the booth across from Bruce as he finally comes to the realization that he does indeed possess all of God's powers.Bruce and God then go for a walk where God tells Bruce about the two rules of his powers; he can't tell anyone he's God and he can't mess with free will. Bruce then sees a boat sail past and he realises that the two of them are walking on a lake in Buffalo. God then leaves Bruce and Bruce runs off to have fun with his powers.Returning to the centre of Buffalo Bruce struts down the street gleefully eager to use his powers on whatever he wants. He points his fingers at a fire hydrant causing it to burst and water to fly out. He then sees an attractive young girl walk past and he causes a gust of wind to lift her skirt giving him a good view of her underwear and bottom. Bruce spies a trendy set of clothes being worn by a mannequin in a shop window and uses his powers to swap them with his own clothes.As he struts further down the street Bruce spots the gang that beat him up earlier and decides to get some revenge on them. He demands that they apologise to him but they just laugh and Bruce is told by the gang leader that he'll get his apology the day a monkey comes out of his butt. Thanks to Bruce's powers however that was that day and a monkey forces its way out of the man's rear end. The other thugs run off but are chased by a swarm of bees that Bruce spits out after them. He then commands the monkey to return into the gang leader.Bruce then teleports himself to the top of a skyscraper creates a lightning storm and declares ""I am Bruce Almighty! My will be done!"".Back at their apartment Grace is sat drinking wine when she hears Bruce outside singing. When she opens the door he kisses her and presents her with a bouquet of flowers which he informs her are a new breed; a cross-pollination between tulips and daisies which he calls ""Todayzees"".While Grace goes to get a vase for the flowers Bruce heads out onto the balcony commanding the stereo to play romantic music. He then alters the night sky to make it more romantic; he erases the clouds creates new stars and pulls the moon closer.Grace then walks out onto the balcony and the romantic sky as well as Bruce running his hands through her hair leads to her becoming very aroused. They start kissing before Grace runs off to the bathroom to prepare for sex. Bruce then runs into the bedroom using his powers to turn the lights off light candles and make his clothes (apart from his underwear) fall off.Bruce then decides to use his powers to encourage Grace into the bedroom and give her a bit of a treat. While he dirty-talks her Bruce uses his divine powers to make Grace have a series of incredibly powerful orgasms and she writhes and moans in ecstasy as she collapses onto the bathroom floor. Grace then emerges from the bathroom full of lust and she pounces on Bruce for a night of indescribably pleasurable lovemaking.The next morning Grace watches TV and sees a news report about a tidal wave in Japan which was caused by ""unusual lunar activity"". Meanwhile Bruce is still in bed sleeping among the bedsheets which have been completely strewn about by the previous night's amorous activities. He is awoken by strange voices in his head but he quickly shrugs them off.Bruce gets dressed and heads downstairs surprising Grace with a kiss before sitting down for breakfast. They briefly discuss the previous night's lovemaking which they both agree was ""heavenly"". Grace then tells Bruce that when she'd woken up that morning she'd felt like her boobs were bigger. He denies that they're bigger but she insists on it. After getting a bit tongue-tied Bruce leaves to get his job back.Bruce's plan includes finding the long missing body of Jimmy Hoffa. When he reports back to the station everyone applauds and Bruce is hired back to his old job of reporting on fluff stories that all somehow turn out to be late breaking news. On Evan's first night as anchor Bruce uses his special powers to endow him with a humiliating stutter.Bruce becomes increasingly enchanted with his new powers and ability to do anything he wants to make his life better. He tries to be good to Grace who thinks that he's on the verge of a marriage proposal. They go out for dinner at the restaurant where they first met and he gets down on his knees in a romantic way not for a marriage proposal but to brag that he finally got anchor!Grace is confused and hurt by Bruce's odd behavior and the bizarre things that are happening around the apartment such as their dog learning how to use and even flush the toilet. In the meantime Bruce starts hearing voices in the background like a huge crowd that's chattering away at a distance. Sometimes the noise increases almost to a roar and starts to overwhelm him.God appears and informs Bruce that he's hearing the sound of people praying. Bruce tries various ways to deal with all the prayers finally using a computer program that downloads everybody's prayers like email. He tries to go through all the prayers one at a time but finds it an impossible task. Giving up he hits a key and yells ""Yes to all!"" Unfortunately this means that everybody who was praying to win the lottery wins all at once so each winner only gets $17 and chaos ensues. Bruce's self-centered and incompetent attempts at playing God are beginning to wreak havoc all over the globe.Bruce roams the city in despair and suddenly finds himself up on top of Mt. Everest with God thinking that he might be in heaven. They talk and God shows Bruce that he has only been using his power in selfish ways and this is destroying everything including Bruce's relationship with Grace. If Bruce wants a miracle he's going to have to ""be the miracle"" giving voice to main theme of the film.The network holds a party to celebrate Bruce's promotion to anchor. By now Grace is completely alienated and refuses to attend. Using his powers Bruce finds a way to persuade her but she arrives to find Bruce not quite resisting a sexy co-worker who's trying to seduce him. This is the last straw for Grace and she breaks off the relationship.Bruce arrives back at his lonely apartment finally realizing that he's going to have to start using his special powers to help people in need. He can't use special powers to housebreak his dog he has to use intelligence patience and ingenuity. He still tries to use his special powers to try to get Grace back but it doesn't work since he's breaking one of the rules God gave him... that he can't use his powers to ""mess with free will."" When he complains about this God replies ""Welcome to my world.""Bruce races back to the warehouse where he first met God and finds him mopping the floor. Coincidentally it's seven o'clock on the seventh day since they first met so God hands Bruce a mop and says ""Right on time."" They mop the floor together and Bruce finally understands what he has to do to fix the mess he has made.Bruce makes amends with Evan ensures that he is reassigned to anchor and goes back to covering human interest fluff stories. He even finishes the photo album that Grace started to commemorate the highlights of their relationship. When Grace's sister (Lisa Ann Walter) comes to pick up Grace's stuff and sees that Bruce has finished the album she takes pity on him and tells him that Grace prays for him all the time.Bruce races to his computer and downloads Grace's prayers. A new one comes in and he realizes she's praying for him right then. He watches her cry and seeing her desperate unhappiness feels utterly forlorn and helpless. Wandering around the city in a state of emotional anguish much like the night he got fired he kneels in the middle of the road to pray and is smacked head on by an oncoming truckBruce suddenly finds himself up in the clouds face-to-face with God in heaven. They have a conversation during which God teaches Bruce how to pray. When Bruce gets the hang of it God presses his fingers against Bruce's chest and there's a huge crashing buzz that Bruce finds very painful. Next Bruce awakens to glaring lights in the middle of the road with an EMT defibrillating him.Next we find Bruce in a hospital bed looking pretty bashed up. Grace comes and climbs in the bed full of compassion and forgiveness. After his discharge still in a cast he returns to the bakery where we found him at the beginning of the film. The bakers display a huge cookie in the shape of a hypodermic needle to promote the Red Cross blood drive and a huge crowd has gathered to donate. Bruce announces that he and Grace are engaged and goes off with her to give blood repeating the film's theme ""Be the miracle.""

Outside of Madame Van Dougen's villa Neil's wish is granted when he sees a suitcase sitting next to a running vehicle. With no one in sight he steals it and returns to his hotel room where he pleads with Marilyn to forgive him for losing their money. Marilyn says she put money aside knowing he would lose it all and chastises him for stealing the suitcase. When they look inside they are shocked to find the body of an old woman (off-camera). Fearing they will be arrested as suspects they pack their belongings and flee the hotel planning to abandon the suitcase along the way.Phoebe arrives at Madame Van Dougen's villa to search for her suitcase followed by Julian who apologizes for leaving her. He goes inside to get her suitcase where police lie in wait. Inspector Bonnard (Giancarlo Giannini) questions Julian who is nervous and appears guilty. Phoebe hides among the crowd that has formed outside the gates and overhears a witness tell police that he saw a man and woman with a dog enter the property and identifies Julian as the man he saw. As Phoebe looks on the dachshund returns home and runs to her side. She hides the pet under her coat while Julian is taken to jail.The next morning Neil and Marilyn Schwary board a train and check the suitcase onto a train headed for a different destination. However as they celebrate their escape the porter chases after them with the suitcase. Despite their protests he pushes it through the window of their departing train car. They try once more to get rid of it to no avail and porters soon find the body after a routine check of passengers' luggage.Inspector Bonnard questions Madame Van Dougen's short housekeeper and butler who claim they were out of the house all evening after learning the housekeeper's sister had been in an automobile accident. When Phoebe is found with the dog she is arrested and brought to the station. The housekeeper and butler confirm that it is in fact Madame Van Dougen's dog Napoleon. Bonnard questions Julian and Phoebe about Augie Morosco whose name was written in a matchbook found next to Van Dougen's body. Julian realizes he must have dropped the matchbook and struggles to explain how it got there. Bonnard declares that their accomplices have arrived as Neil and Marilyn Schwary are brought into the station in handcuffs. However Julian and Phoebe do not know Neil and Marilyn and Bonnard tries to sort out the truth as everyone claims their innocence.Meanwhile Augie buys flowers for Elena and vows to have given up gambling for good. She forgives him and tells him the newspaper story about Van Dougen's murder. Back at the police station Neil names Augie as his alibi on the night of the murder and Bonnard calls Augie in for questioning. When Augie reveals that he met Van Dougen several weeks before at a casino Bonnard believes he is guilty. Surprised to see all four of his American acquaintances from the train behind bars Augie reluctantly admits to having met Julian and Phoebe on the train but refuses to admit that he knows Neil and Marilyn whom he suspects of being guilty. Augie claims he was with his wife at the time of the murder and later asks Elena to be his alibi. She confesses that she was with another man at the time in retaliation for Augie's gambling. When Italian playboy Alfonso de la Pena overhears their conversation at a restaurant he flees and Elena admits that Alfonso was her lover. Augie follows Alfonso and convinces him to keep quiet about the events of that night.That evening Bonnard arrives at the hotel to question Augie again and reveals that a man was seen going out the fire escape of his wife's room. Augie claims to have been the man and Bonnard asks him to reenact the events of the night following Augie to the fire escape and forcing him to walk across a beam to the other side of the street where he gained entrance into Van Dougen's villa. Augie and Bonnard enter Van Dougen's home where Bonnard has gathered the American suspects to try to get to the truth. They turn on each other as they each proclaim their innocence. However Elena refuses to name Alfonso de la Pena as the man she was with until Bonnard brings him into the room. Julian instantly recognizes Alfonso's shiny shoes and insists he was the man in the bushes at the crime scene. Alfonso confesses that he and Van Dougen whom he calls ""Claire"" were secret lovers and insists she was not in her bedroom when he arrived for their regular rendezvous. He only hid in the bushes to protect Claire's privacy when he heard Julian and Phoebe arrive. Finally Bonnard brings in the housekeeper and butler and reveals several holes in their story forcing the butler to confess that he and the housekeeper murdered Van Dougen due to her abusive and harsh treatment of them.The Americans celebrate their release over dinner with Bonnard in attendance. Julian toasts to Napoleon for the dog's part in leading him to his new love Phoebe while Marilyn reveals her $500000 winnings to Neil and demands he start treating her with more respect. Later Bonnard tells one of his detectives that Madame Van Dougen left her $20 million fortune to Napoleon and realizes that whoever inherited the dog will actually receive the money.Elsewhere in the final scene Alfonso de la Pena sips champagne on a yacht with Napoleon."

It seems everyone is trying to get into heaven; at least those whose time is up. For Lance Barton a struggling comedian and bicycle messenger it's the last thing on his mind. His due date upstairs is 50 years away. In the meantime he's got big dreams to pursue on Earth such as landing a slot at the final Amateur Night Contest at the famed Apollo Theatre. Lance's has one little problem though - he ain't that funny. Thanks to an over-cautious emissary from heaven Mr. Keyes he's going to get hit (literally) with a much bigger problem. Showing that even God has difficulty finding good help these days the inept minion mistakenly plucks Lance from a traffic accident - before it takes place. Transporting him to the Pearly Gates or more accurately the velvet roped-lines of the hottest club around the error is finally addressed by Mr. King the streetwise no-nonsense head angel who manages the place from his plush windowed office. Since returning to his own body on Earth is impossible the urban dwelling Lance reluctantly agrees to a normally unthinkable proposal. He'll occupy the body of a wealthy old white mogul Charles Wellington until a more suitable body can be found. Strangely enough in a Park Avenue penthouse servants and butlers become his new homeys as Lance works on his streetwise comedy routine for the big Apollo showdown. Living in the body of a callous old white man would be bizarre enough for Lance without falling in love with Sontee the beautiful woman publicly battling Wellington's company at the same time. And if that wasn't enough he's got to deal with the love affair between Wellington's wife and his personal assistant and their plot to have him killed. Can reincarnation lead to self discovery true love and a better stand up routine? Lance Barton is about to find out.::Gilbert lee

"We begin in a church where a bold and fearless English journalist and reporter named Joe Strombel is being eulogized. Afterward a group of his colleagues are in a bar drinking and reminiscing and they toast to Joe wherever he is.Cut to the barge of the dead ferrying recently deceased to their destination. Aboard is Joe Strombel (Ian McShane) trying to bribe the ferryman. He strikes up a conversation with another deceased soul on the ferry Jane Cook now former secretary to Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman) son of an English lord. Joe mentions that he died of a coronary thrombosis. Jane however believes she was murdered... by Lyman himself. Jane tells Joe hat she was getting suspicious that Lyman was in fact a serial killer known to English police as the Tarot Card killer. Joe wrote a case about these murders when they first began and wonders why Jane suspects Lyman.Jane says that at the last murder a cufflink was found-- an expensive Art Deco. Lyman had these exact cufflink models... and before Jane died she noticed he'd lost one of them. Jane phoned her lawyer for advice on whether to report it and heard a faint click on the phone line as if someone had been listening in. Later that day she'd had a cup of tea and she died very suddenly shortly afterward leading her to suspect that her tea had been poisoned. This fascinates Joe and he's a little sad that he got the 'scoop' on Lyman but now that he's dead he can't tell the story to others.At the prestigious Dorchester Hotel a film director named Tinsley is arriving and at the door to his room is a young American journalism student named Sondra Pransky (Scarlet Johannsen). Pransky is very excited at meeting Tinsley in person and asks to interview him. Although tired and still busy Tinsley agrees. But Pransky young and still naive doesn't get the interview because Tinsley gets her drunk even seduces her but her intoxication makes her fall asleep and when she wakes up as she tells a close family friend later he was on his way to Thailand. Although her friend Vivian (Romola Garai) tries to console and reassure her Pransky is still unhappy about blowing the story.Meanwhile Joe Strombel has been moping about the death barge and sits on the edge of the deck. When he's satisfied nobody is looking he tips over into the River Styx and swims away.Pransky goes with Vivian and her little brother to see a stage show. One of the acts in the show is a magician with the stage name Splendini (Woody Allen). Splendini's act blends illusion with comedy and he speaks obsequiously but the audience enjoys his performance.Splendini calls for a volunteer and Pransky is selected from the audience to come on stage. After some small talk Splendini puts Pransky into a prop box that he says will 'agitate her molecules and split them apart' before he 'puts her back together.'The trick goes off without a hitch except for Pransky: while she's in the box oblivious to what's going on outside Joe Strombel appears to her and tells her the scoop about the Tarot Card murder case but he's only able to say Peter Lyman's name before he disappears pulled back onto the ferry to meet his destiny. Meanwhile Splendini opens the box to show Pransky standing inside slowly waving her hand around the box's interior. She's at a loss for words as to what she saw which Splendini and the audience mistake as awe at how the trick worked and he sends her back to her seat to a round of applause.Later in her room Pransky googles the Tarot Card killer. She sees that he preys on prostitutes and has recently claimed a tenth victim after going off the radar a year ago. He always strikes in different parts of London and leaves a tarot card on his victims-- usually the Hangman card. She then googles Joe Strombel reading about his distinguished career for a London newspaper and his fearlessness in pursuing a story.Pransky goes back to the stage show site and asks to speak to Splendini whose real name is Sidney Waterman. Pransky tells him about a spirit appearing in the box while she was inside which Waterman hears with skepticism. Pransky insists that there is or rather was a Joe Strombel and she googled him and read about how he died three days ago and that he was a journalist like she is a journalism student. She asks Waterman to put her back in the box where she hopes she can re-establish contact.Waterman perhaps a little reluctantly puts Pransky back in the 'dematerializer' box where she tries to talk to Strombel and convince him to tell her more about the story. But after several minutes nothing happens and the cynical Waterman tries to send Pransky on her way thinking she's a little crazy.But just then Strombel suddenly appears asking Pransky to write down some details. Waterman stares in shocked amazement as he watches Strombel give Pransky details on the Tarot Card murder case how all his victims were prostitutes with short brunette hair. Strombel tells Pransky that Lyman is a well-respected aristocrat with connections meaning she can't go to the police without solid proof because otherwise he's above reproach; also if he sniffs out any suspicion on him he'll become impossible to trap. Strombel tells Pranskky that Lyman might have poisoned his own secretary because he suspected she was catching on to him. Pransky must pursue the story first on her own without police aid and then break it only when she can prove the suspicion. Strombel tells Pransky that this story can change her life if she has the courage to pursue it but she must be careful because lives are in the balance including her own. Looking nervous Strombel says his time is up and he must go. Death appears and takes Strombel disappearing right after.Pransky is determined to break the story and she needs Waterman's help... exactly what Waterman is now too scared to give. He does small time card and coin tricks and has no idea how to help a journalism student pursue a real big-time story. He tries to convince Pransky to go to the police only to realize what would happen to her if she accused a well-respected lord's son of being a serial killer based on a lead from a dead man's spirit.Pransky is staking out a corporate skyscraper hoping to spot Lyman even though she isn't certain what he looks like. But Pransky is sure it's Lyman who walks out of the building. He gets into a cab and Pransky hurries to another waiting cab in order to follow him.The cab drops Lyman off at an antiques gallery and Waterman asks Pransky if she's satisfied that she's gotten a look at him... but just then they find out that the man isn't Lyman at all. Waterman takes Pransky outside and tells her that she should live her life without further embarrassments and that he needs to go home.Pransky has coffee with Vivian who tells her that she hears that Lyman swims at the governor's club; a posh exclusive private gentleman's club. Vivian's father has a business partner who is a member and members are allowed to bring guests in.Pransky rounds up Waterman again and takes him to the club. At the pool they spot a man swimming by himself and Pransky is unsure how to meet him. Waterman suggests she pretend to get a cramp in the pool and feign drowning and if Lyman is the gentleman he's purported as he'll come to her aid.Waterman goes to get coffee and Pransky decided to try his plan. She gets into the pool and starts floundering and gasping in the water; her head going under a few times. Lyman hurries over and swims her to the edge so she can sit. Pransky thanks him fawningly saying she wasn't a good swimmer and her leg cramped. Lyman notes he hasn't seen her face before and asks if she's a new member. Lyman knows Jack Fulton the business partner of Vivian's father. Pransky decides to introduce herself as Jade Julliard Spence part of a wealthy family from Palm Beach.Waterman's plan pays off as Lyman invites her to a garden party his father is throwing that weekend at his estate. Pransky is glad to accept and as Waterman returns Pransky introduces him as her father. Waterman isn't pleased about the idea and still thinks Pransky is taking too many wild chances but still agrees to help her.Sunday comes and Pransky and Waterman arrive at the Lyman estate for the garden party. Lyman introduces them to his father Lord Lyman (Julian Glover) who notes their lack of social graces and hapless attempts to converse but stays silent. He suggests that Lyman show Pransky and Waterman around the estate.While showing them around Lyman makes further conversation and eventually Pransky takes one of the offered bones asking if Lyman will show her how to fly fish. While they're on the lake Waterman does a few card tricks for other guests and further bungles attempts at conversation showing his ineptitude but in a way that nobody catches on.Pransky makes further small talk as she walks through the gardens with Lyman and finally drops a hint by saying she's into New Age items such as crystals and tarot. Lyman says he's more scientific minded and given his background of privilege it's seemed a given that he's destined to enter politiccs. When Pransky mentions she also likes to dance Lyman offers to take her dancing. Pransky looks at Lyman with another fawning glance and the chemistry and sparks of attraction between the two are clear.Lyman then says he'll have his new secretary send Pransky a list of Chinese restaurants since she's said she likes Chinese food and mentions his previous secretary a young woman died suddenly of a blood clot. When Pransky curiously asks if an autopsy was done to confirm this Lyman skillfully and quickly changes the subjectDuring this time Waterman is snooping around private rooms of the estate including Lyman's bedroom. He finds an envelope of some kind in Lyman's bag and carefully secretes it in an inside jacket pocket.Pransky continues to talk with Lyman and the two start to become infatuated with one another.One of Lyman's cars drops Pransky and Waterman off and the two start to argue at first over Waterman's endless babble and then over whether Lyman has killed anyone which both of them believe he hasn't. When Pransky mentions that Lyman offered to take her dancing Waterman describes this as a way of gathering clues and then shows her one-- the envelope Waterman swiped from Lyman's overnight bag contains part of a name scrawled on it: Betty G. Pransky takes the news skeptically saying this woman could be anyone.Waterman meets some of Lyman's associates for a poker game he's been invited to. Lyman arrives late due to having been bogged down at work and Waterman is doing well being a skilled player.Meanwhile Pransky is discussing her infatuation with Lyman with Vivian downplaying it. She stops suddenly seeing a newspaper sign saying that the Tarot killer has struck once more. Reading the article with Waterman they see the murder victim was a short-haired brunette prostitute just like all the previous ones and the same tarot card the Hangman was left by her body. Lyman arrived at the poker game at a sufficient hour that Waterman believes would have given him plenty of time to kill the prostitute if he did in fact commit the murder. Pransky knows she needs to dig deeper despite her growing crush on Lyman; she needs to get a closer look at where he lives.Lyman shows Pransky around his house away from the estate; tastefully decorated with several art works Pransky recognizes from her college studies. Downstairs is a climate-controlled room with many rare musical instruments.Pransky calls the room romantic and Lyman suddenly leans in and steals a kiss. Pransky smiles at him.Waterman is putting on another magic show as Splendini and is putting another woman from the audience into his ""dematerializer"" box. When he opens the box to show that she's disappeared Joe Strombel leans out and urgently tells Waterman in a hushed voice to remember the number sequence 16 21 12. The audience thinks this is part of the trick and laughs in appreciation.Pransky is stepping out of Lyman's shower after having had sex with him. She notes the smell of his aftershave Yardley which he's used exclusively since his teenage years. Lyman decides to get some champagne and tells Pransky to stay in his bedroom; he's also offering to make eggs for the both of them. This is exactly what Pransky has been waiting for and she starts snooping around the room. Lyman comes back to find Pransky looking through a photo album looking at a photograph of a woman with short brunette hair-- Lyman's mother who he says was a difficult woman. Lyman asks Pransky to stay the night but she backs out with a hastily concocted cover story about her father not feeling that well.Waterman and Lyman meet for a drink the next day and are comparing their finds. Waterman thinks the number sequence Strombel gave him is the combination to a safe. Pransky realizes that this might be the combination to the room where Lyman keeps his instruments and asks Waterman for the number sequence which Waterman suddenly doesn't want to give outArriving back at Vivian's house Pransky finds a bouquet of flowers and an invitation to a party at Lyman's house on Saturday. Pransky admits to Vivian that she's falling in love with Lyman.Saturday night at Lyman's party. Pransky talks with some guests while Waterman shows a few others one of his card tricks. Pransky takes him aside and presses him to go downstairs and try to get into the music room while she distracts Lyman. Waterman reluctantly does so but struggles to remember the combination until he finally gets it right and enters the room while Pransky tries to maintain her composure staying near Lyman. While he looks around a butler gets two wine bottles notices the door to the music room ajar and closes and locks it trapping Waterman inside.Pransky finally excuses herself and creeps downstairs to find Waterman locked in the room. He gives her the combination and she comes inside. Meanwhile Lyman asks his butler if he's seen where Pransky has gone and he mentions he thought he saw her go downstairs (his bathroom is upstairs). They manage to get out of the room without finding anything before Lyman sees them standing outside. The guests are preparing to leave and Lyman sweet-talks Pransky into staying the night.While Lyman is sleeping Pransky sneaks back to the music room. Hidden underneath the bell of one of the horns is several decks of tarot cards. She makes it back upstairs just as Lyman notices her out of bed holding a glass of milk which she says might help her sleep. Lyman suddenly drops a question would Jade consider staying in England with him past the end of the summer instead of returning home.Later Lyman takes Pransky to a park and gives her a bracelet as a birthday gift. He mentions he has to go out of town for a few days but will take her out for a celebration when he returns. The gesture leaves Pransky feeling very guilty about herself and her investigation and when Strombel appears before her at Vivian's house to encourage her to keep digging she accuses him of wanting to be right so he can get credit for his last big scoop.Waterman takes Pransky out for Indian food as a belated birthday gift and Waterman is talking about how he can't live in London because English traffic keeps to the left not the right and it makes him frightened he's going to die in a car crash. Pransky suddenly notices Lyman walking down the street-- despite having told her he was out of town. She insists on following him from a distance.Peter has enough of a lead that Pransky and Waterman take the wrong path at a fork and they lose him. But nearby there are suddenly calls for help: a woman has been strangled and a tarot card was found near her body.It's in the newspaper the next day; the victim's name was Elizabeth Gibson a short-haired brunette woman. Reading about it Pransky and Waterman flip flop further on whether they should speak to someone. If the police wouldn't believe them without more proof Pransky wonders about speaking to another journalist; Vivian's father has a friend who works for a local London paper The Observer.The Observer's editor Mr. Malcolm (Charles Dance) sits Pransky and Waterman down for a lengthy lecture on the folly of making an accusation against Lyman along with the fact that he knew Strombel well and knows that he would never have shared a tip with any reliability with anyone else especially a student. He then lets drop a bombshell that the real Tarot Card killer has been caught: a handyman named Henry Banks who has confessed to two additional murders his fingerprints and DNA evidence match and he knew things never disclosed by the press that only the killer would know. All the papers are going to press with the story as they speak.Pransky is relieved as she reads one of the paper reports and feels remorseful over having lied to Lyman. She's now looking forward to pursuing her romantic relationship with a man she's come to love if he can forgive her for her deceptions.Alone with Lyman at his father's estate Pransky is enjoying some romantic alone time as they have the estate to themselves for a while. Lyman confesses he lied about being out of town saying he had to attend to helping Lord Lyman with a business matter that they both wanted to keep private from the press. It bothers him because he dislikes dishonesty as he tells Pransky.This shakes Pransky's courage but finally she confesses the whole truth to Lyman about who she and Waterman really are and that she had heard a crazy story and got a crazy notion of making a name for herself since she and Lyman hadn't met yet. To her astonishment and relief Lyman finds the story very funny saying it's made his day that she would have thought he was some kind of fiend. When she lets drop she knows about the tarot deck in the music room he says it was a Victorian deck that was intended to be a gift for her since she told him that she was into mystical new age items like tarot.So foolish does Pransky feel about this news and relieved that Lyman still loves her that she argues fiercely in Lyman's defense the next day at Vivian's home when Waterman tells her that he doesn't let Lyman off the hook-- he still feels Lyman not Banks is the one who killed Elizabeth Gibson. Betty is often short for Elizabeth and ""Betty G"" was written on that envelope Waterman found. Waterman thinks Lyman was being blackmailed by Gibson over seeing prostitutes and it would destroy his reputation if he was found out. Pransky won't hear it. She tells Waterman to go back to his card tricks.At the stage venue Strombel appears to Waterman; Strombel gave Waterman the idea that Lyman killed Gibson in the hopes of pinning the crime on the Tarot Card killer because he knew Pransky wouldn't listen to him anymore. Strombel also says that he's used every trick he knows to cheat death and he doubts he'll be able to sneak away to see Waterman or Pransky again. He asks Waterman to look after Pransky because Strombel admires her spirit and also suggests Waterman look to see if a card is missing from the Tarot deck in Lyman's music room.Waterman goes to the building where Gibson lived and was killed and asks questions of people posing as a reporter. One woman tells him that everyone called Gibson 'Betty' and she used to be a long haired blonde but cut it short and dyed it black probably to please a regular client. One of whom was ""some rich kid"" named Peter Yardley.Frantic Waterman calls Pransky at the Lyman estate to warn her and she's having none of it. But perhaps she should: Lyman in another room picks up an extension and listens. He returns to Pransky who says she's going to change before their next romantic interlude and she kisses him happily.Waterman takes a taxi to Lyman's house and tells the housekeeper that Pransky asked him to pick up a red sweater that she believes she left there. When the housekeeper goes up to find it Waterman sneaks down to the music room and finds a key under the French horn. The housekeeper catches him leaving the room which shows Waterman knew the combination but she doesn't stop him from leaving the house. Instead she calls Lyman to report it.Waterman goes back to Gibson's building and finds that the key he took from the music room opens the door to Gibson's apartment. Lyman had the key to her apartment. That's all Waterman needs to know.Lyman takes Pransky onto a rowboat to go on the lake at his estate. Right about the middle of the lake he puts up the oars and he and Pransky start to talk. She asks what he's thinking about at the moment and he says that life is ironic and tragic; he met Pransky by saving her from drowning found her very enchanting and now she has to drown.Lyman confesses to Pransky that he killed Betty Gibson just as Waterman has suspected and has probably acquired enough proof by now to take to the authorities. Lyman had been seeing Gibson many times over the years and she finally learned who he really was and began blackmailing him; a constant demand for money that he felt he had to put a stop to. He studied the Tarot Card killer case and arranged to make Gibson's murder look like a reappearance by the serial killer.Pransky starts to recoil in fear as Lyman tells her everything and tells Lyman that Waterman will know if Lyman kills her. Lyman answers that her death will be a drowning; arranged to look like a boating accident while he'll arrange for another accident for Waterman later; a two-bit vaudevillain named Splendini will not be treated as a major murder case.Pransky screams for help and Lyman simply leans back and waits-- his estate is very large and secluded and nobody is around for miles.Waterman in the meantime has been driving like mad in a tiny little car to reach Pransky... but loses control of the vehicle on the back country's twisting roads due to traffic moving on the left side and crashes just as he'd always feared he would.Lyman finally reaches over and grabs Pransky grappling with her. Despite her struggles he throws her off the boat into the lake and starts to row back to shore. He watches as Pransky flounders in the water and her head goes under the surface.Lyman rows back to the dock and then kicks the boat away back toward the lake's interior before he hurries into the mansion and calls the police. Feigning crying he reports a terrible boating accident at his estate and a woman has drowned.Police arrive and an officer comes into the house where Lyman is talking with the investigating detective (Anthony Stewart Head) and reports that the other officers in the area think they know where the body is. Lyman tells his cover story and explains that he met Pransky by rescuing her from drowning in the club pool and she was a weak swimmer.But no sooner does Lyman say this when he hears Pransky's voice calling to him and she comes into the room dripping wet but quite alive. Pransky tells Lyman that she was faking being a poor swimmer at the club in order to get his attention; in reality she's an excellent swimmer who captained a community swim team in her native Brooklyn.After Lyman is arrested Pransky writes her story for The Observer. Mr. Malcolm is very pleased with Pransky's investigative journalism and tells her he's proud to run the story in his paper. Pransky announces she needs to share credit with both Joe Strombel and Sidney Waterman. She's learned now that Waterman is dead and says half to herself that wherever Waterman is now she'll never forget him.A final scene shows Waterman riding the barge of the dead with some other passengers. He strikes up some small talk and starts to do a card trick 'if he has time.' One passenger remarks 'I believe we have eternity.'

"Professor Post is a solemn and unworldly Greek scholar and when a party is proposed he prefers to stay in and read Aristotle. His manservant worries that his master does not properly enjoy life and he forges a paper informing the professor that he has inherited $750000 hoping that this will encourage him to live a little.The professor is taken in and goes off to see the world on the strength of the paper although of course the money does not exist. At the railway station he meets some members of a song and dance troupe the Midnight Miads and he speaks to Pansy Peets; she says that she is a dancer and he says What a coincidence; you know I have made an exhaustive study of Greek dancing!As the train is leaving Post realises that he has left a trunk on the platform and he manages to stop the train. The railway officials remonstrate with him for stopping the train for such a matter but Jimmy Dodge a comedian with the troupe intervenes on Posts behalf.When the train gets to Fishs Switch station the troupe are disembarking; there is a bus to take them to the hotel. Post is engrossed in farewells to his new-found friends that he fails to get back on the train in time and he is left alone at the station. He eventually gets a lift to the town and rejoins the troupe.But the players have no money and a warrant server arrives to foreclose them because of unpaid debts elsewhere. However Post has some money on him and pays off the debts earning the performers gratitude. Nonetheless they realise it is only a postponement of the inevitable and everyone is gloomy until Post announces that he will fund the players expenses from his own pocket. Jimmy Dodge suggests that Post takes over the running of the troupe and Post agrees that it would be a broadening experience. No-one opposes this arrangement and when Post announces that he must be in New York for professional reasons they realise that they will have to locate their performances there too on Broadway.In New York Post sets up offices as a theatrical producer but the theatre manager is critical of the abilities of the performers in general and Pansy Peets in particular. This is too much for Post and an argument ensues and the manager walks out. Post runs after him and returns subdued saying that the production will proceed anyway in accordance with his own views.Later a vampish woman arrives at the office and wants to speak to Post; she says she is Eleanor Espere the personality girl. She has heard that Post is bankrolling the production and its obvious that she wants to get some of it. When they ask what her previous work has been she says she worked at a place that had previously been a Speakeasy. Post corrects her grammar and says that she should says Speak Easily and Dodge says that this will do for a title for the production.She gets hired and during rehearsals she takes the opportunity to persuade Post to pay for her apartment and he could run up there if ever he wants a cup of tea she says coquettishly. The nave Post agrees because he believes it is customary in theatrical circles.Espere goes with him to his hotel room and her object is to lure the nave academic into marriage a meal ticket for life. She plies him with alcohol although he does not drink she says it is only fruit juice. But she gets as drunk as he does She is unable to seduce him however and the following morning she tries to entrap him first by reminding him that a gentleman who has compromised a lady must marry her and then arranging for her brother to arrive and threaten him.Jimmy Dodge is the comedian in the troupe and he has taken a liking to Post; and this point he comes to his rescue changing clothes with him in a separate room and then appearing and agreeing to marry the woman which of course she refuses.Opening night on Broadway has arrived and Dodge uses a ruse to send Dodge off to New Jersey to get him out of the way as he knows he will be more troublesome if he is present; but Post manages to get back to the theatre. A man has come to serve a writ for unpaid debts and he will not leave until he has seen Post. There is interplay between Pansy and Eleanor she has told Post to get rid of Pansy but Post has discovered romantic feelings for Pansy and he has reassured her that the incident in the hotel room meant nothing to him.The performance starts and it is embarrassingly bad; Post himself rushes on stage and corrects the players performances and the crowd assume it is part of the act and love it. Post announces his apologies in formal classical language and this adds to the laughter; even a man who has come to serve yet another writ for debts thinks Post is a great comedian and when Post says he is the proprietor (to whom the writ should be delivered) he just laughs.The chaos on stage intensifies and the curtain falls to general applause. The writ server is back stage and wants $10000 which no-one has. But the theatre impresario is vastly impressed with the performance and offers a contract that will make the debt merely small change.Eleanor is looking for Post still no doubt hoping to use her feminine allure to get her hands on some of his money but at that moment a scenery tab is shifted and in the final scene she sees Post in a passionate embrace with Pansy.

"Mr. & Mrs. Sidney Larkin - Pop and Ma - operate a farm in rural Maryland with their five children the farm passed down through generations of Pop's family. They are more than content with their life. Pop largely operates on the barter system as he believes these goods and services are truly the measures of worth to people while money just gets in the way. He has inbred this sensibility into his family all the children who happily do their part around the farm and have skills of their own which assist in running the farm or which they can barter for what they need. They are generally well loved within the community - Pop gladly donating his time and goods to community causes - except by their controlling next door neighbor the wealthy Wendell Burnshaw who if he had his way would buy out the Larkins to force them to move. The last straw for Burnshaw is when Pop without asking ""borrows"" Burnshaw's prized boar as stud for his own sow the barter in Pop's mind to be Burnshaw having first pick of the litter. Burnshaw believing that Pop is a cheat who always seems to have all the money he needs probably cheats on his income taxes as well and as such decides to use one of his tax lawyer's contacts at Internal Revenue cutthroat Oliver Kelsey to investigate the Larkins. Kelsey finds that Pop has never filed an income tax return and thus has never paid income tax. As such Kelsey gets his chief investigator Lorenzo Charlton to conduct an audit on the Larkins. Lorenzo is officious and ambitious he having aspirations to be a lawyer and congressman. Having nothing to hide Pop welcomes who the family coins"" Charlie"" into their home for him to do whatever he needs. Complications ensue when Charlie finds that the case is more difficult than it first appears as the continual bartering does not have a paper trail or has such a long lineage it difficult to find the beginning. Further complications ensue when Pop and Ma believe that Charlie is just the type of man that their eldest daughter the spunky and pretty Mariette Larkin should marry rather than the many farm boys with who she has generally just roughhoused up to this point but who are obviously attracted to her as a boy is to a girl. Mariette is attracted to Charlie if he would just loosen up a little. The audit may become a sticking point between the two in ever getting together Charlie who knows that the Larkins should owe something but how much within the context is a good question especially as he too is gaining an affinity for the family and for Mariette. Burnshaw Kelsey and Kelsey's superiors may have some say in the matter.::Huggo"

Bill Murray decides to be all that he can be -- and it ain't pretty -- in this hit comedy. John Winger (Murray) is a quick-witted loser who comes home after losing his job to discover that his car has been repossessed and his girlfriend is leaving him. With no idea of what to do next Winger and his best friend Russell Ziskey (Harold Ramis) impulsively join the Army more as a practical joke than a career goal. Winger and Russell soon find themselves in basic training under the hard-nosed professional Sergeant Hulka (Warren Oates) who is stuck with an outfit of goofballs including overweight Ox (John Candy) naive Cruiser (John Deihl) stoner Elmo (Judge Reinhold) and the appropriately-nicknamed Psycho (Conrad Dunn). Things do not go well and ultimately Sgt. Hulka is injured in a training accident. Their commanding officer (John Larroquette) threatens to make them all take basic training again! Winger and Russell find time to romance two pretty female MPs Stella (P.J. Soles) and Louise (Sean Young). At graduation Winger leads the platoon in a crazy drill routine which nonetheless impresses the General. The entire platoon is sent to Italy and are reunited with Sergeant Hulka.Stealing the top-secret EM50 (a kind of armored personnel carrier disguised as an RV) that they were supposed to be testing John and Russell go to visit their girlfriends in Germany. Their platoon goes to find them but is so incompetent that they wind up in communist Czechoslovakia! The errant soldiers and their girlfriends come to the rescue with the EM50 fighting their way in as Russell reads the documentation for the advanced weapons systems. With a little help from Sergeant Hulka (the only platoon member NOT captured) they break out the others and are ultimately decorated for valor.

In basic training they are only two of a bunch of misfits that comprise their platoon. However it is still John that is constantly butting heads with their drill sergeant Sergeant Hulka. Two of their saving graces are Stella and Louise two MPs who get them out of one scrape after another. Their entire platoon is in jeopardy of not graduating. But what happens during basic leads to their entire platoon being assigned to an overseas mission in Italy to test a new urban assault vehicle the EM-50 project. John and Russell decide to take the EM-50 for an unauthorized test drive to visit Stella and Louise who have been reassigned to West Germany. In the process the rest of the platoon Hulka and Hulka's immediate superior self-absorbed Captain Stillman get caught unofficially behind enemy Communist lines in Czechoslovakia. John and Russell with Stella and Louise's help will have to show their true mettle as US army soldiers and in the process test the capabilities of the EM-50 to rescue their platoon without the rest of the US army knowing what's going on and thus without any assistance beyond themselves.::Huggo

"Jesse Veldini has just been released from his third prison sentence. His larceny is not a compulsion in and of itself but a means to support his passion of driving in demolition derbies. Veldini has two primary objectives this time out of prison: never to return to prison and to reach a specific milestone in his demolition derby career these two goals which may be incompatible. One of Veldini's brothers Frank Veldin (who has anglicized his surname) a police detective is determined for Veldini to live a life of the straight and narrow at any cost. Frank has ulterior motives as he has political aspirations most specifically to take a run for District Attorney. At their regular hangout of the scrap yard Veldini reconnects with some of his old ""motley"" crew who are equally as non-conformist as him: Eagle a former human fly in a circus who realizes he is a bit off kilter as shown by he institutionalizing himself voluntarily and Veldini's kid brother known solely as The Kid a guitar player who will follow Veldini in whatever he wants to do. Somewhat outside of this group is Iris Caine a hooker with unofficial connections in high places. Eagle is certain that Veldini won't survive in the outside the way that Frank wants and thus is able to convince another motley crew member Duval Jax based on his current abode and project Veldini and the rest of the crew to work on an ultimate goal: to make the plane in which Duval is currently renting and living in operational so that they can escape the tyranny that is Veldini and their collective current lives by flying away to wherever their hearts' desire. In order to do so they need to buy the plane and purchase the parts they can't scrounge from the scrap yard. That would require the collective to enter or reenter a life of larceny. The major obstacle to them achieving this goal is Frank who would not hesitate to send Veldini back to prison for his own personal gain.::Huggo"

Barris phones Mabel to announce that he is taking a hiatus and does not know when he will return.The next day after buying a one-way ticket to Morocco Barris walks aimlessly through the Moroccan desert until a helicopter appears and lands. A cloaked figure disembarks from the helicopter and approaches. It is Didlo with good news: the affiliate stations want Barris back and so does Red.

"Edmond [Kirk Wilson] is an aspiring artist. Several months ago he attended an art
showing and was particularly attracted to a canvas painted in red shadows.
He thought he saw death in the canvas but the artist Diana [Dawn Spinella] (who happened
to be standing nearby) explained that the real meaning was rebirth. After
a few minutes of conversation Edmond and Diana were obviously attracted
to each other and Diana invited Edmond to become her apprentice. Edmond
jumped at the chance. They went to Diana's studio where they had sex and
Diana revealed that she was a vampire. She proved it by stabbing herself
in the stomach. She then asked Edmond to allow her to turn him so that he
could be with her forever. Edmond refused.Now it is some four months later. Edmond has become Diana's renfield.
It is his duty to pick up pretty homeless prostitutes and deliver them to
Diana so that she can use them as models. Unfortunately for the model
Diana first drinks her fill of their blood then collects any remaining
blood to use in her color pallette. When she has finished Edmond cleans
up the mess and buries the body.Diana has an art opening in four days and needs two more models to
complete her display. After securing one model Edmond goes out for a
drink with his friend Connor [Leo Otero]. They happen upon a young hooker named Dee [Erin Smith]
who offers them sex for $20. Edmond isn't interested but Connor takes Dee
up on it. Unlike Edmond Connor fantasizes about being a vampire. When he
bites Dee's neck during sex she screams and runs away.A few nights later while searching for another suitable model for
Diana's final painting Edmond comes across Dee in an alley. She is
desperate and begs Edmond for help. Edmond takes her back to his place
gives her a hot shower and some clean clothes and offers her sanctuary so
that she can rest. Suddenly Diana breezes in the front door. She likes
what she sees in Dee and offers her a chance to pose. Dee is totally
willing but Edmond (knowing what Diana REALLY has in mind) refuses to
take her to Diana's house. To keep Dee from going on her own Edmond ties
her to his bed and decides to kill Diana.While Edmond's father Marvin [Larry Palatta] makes Italian meatballs and entertains
Dee with his songs and his Jimmy Durante impressions Edmond goes over to
Connor's house to ask for help killing Diana. Connor points out that
since Diana survived stabbing herself in the abdomen it's possible that a
stake in the chest won't hurt her either something that Edmond hadn't
thought about. They arrive at Diana's studio and try the normal vampire
killing articles--crucifixes and stakes--but Diana merely laughs at them
bats them around a bit informs them that only a vampire can kill a
vampire and then knocks Edmond out.Edmond wakes up to find Diana gone and Connor watching him. Edmond
can see right away from the wound on Connor's neck that Connor has been
bitten by Diana. Connor explains how after Diana knocked Edmond out she
vowed to kill Dee bit Connor and informed him that he won't totally turn
into a vampire until after he makes his first kill. Connor has decided
that his first kill will be Edmond. After going at each other for a few
rounds during which Edmond breaks one of Connor's fangs and Connor breaks
Edmond's hand the boys hug and make up. But when Connor takes another
lunge at Edmond's neck Edmond is forced to plunge the stake into Connor's
chest.Edmond lumbers home to find Dee missing and his father with a bite
wound on the neck. A note on the bed says that Diana has taken Dee and
intends to bury her in the graveyard with the others. Realizing that his
father is now a half vampire Edmond coerces Marvin to go downtown with
him. The plan is for Marvin to kill a homeless guy turn into a full
vampire and then kill Diana. Edmond lures a homeless guy into the alley.
When the homeless guy finds what Edmond and Marvin have in store for him
he has a heart attack on the spot. Marvin needs only to finish him off and
drink a bit of his blood.Now that Marvin has turned into a full vampire Edmond drives them to
the graveyard where he confronts Diana who has tied Dee to a tree. Not
about to let Marvin kill her Diana grabs Dee and leads Edmond and Marvin
on a wild goose chase. Just when Diana has cornered Dee and Edmond and is
about to kill them Marvin sneaks up behind and stabs Diana with a
paintbrush. Diana goes up in flames. As the flames die out Dee assures
Marvin that vampires are really IN nowadays while Edmond paints their
picture using Diana's ashes and the paintbrush that killed her.

"The film centers on the friendship between three women who work in the offices of a large corporation known as Consolidated Industries. Judy Bernly (Jane Fonda) is a nave new employee whose husband Dick (Lawrence Pressman) recently left her for his secretary. On her first day Judy meets Violet Newstead (Lily Tomlin) the supervisor of her department and a longtime employee. Violet trains Judy and introduces her to the department executive Franklin Hart Jr. (Dabney Coleman) who immediately reveals himself to be arrogant and sexist. Judy soon learns that despite the fact that Violet has worked there for over 10 years she has been passed over consistently for promotion and in fact has seniority over Hart. Violet also introduces Judy to the staff including mail room clerk Eddie (Ray Vitte) alcoholic secretary Margaret Foster (Peggy Pope) and Roz Keith (Elizabeth Wilson) Hart's executive assistant. The third woman in the trio is Doralee Rhodes (Dolly Parton) Hart's personal secretary. Despite the fact that Doralee is happily married to a construction worker and part-time country-western singer named Dwayne (Jeffrey Douglas Thomas) and Hart is also married to a sweet but oblivious woman named Missy (Marian Mercer) Hart continually makes inappropriate advances toward Doralee pushing her patience and tolerance to the limit. Hart has also been lying to his colleagues that he's been sleeping with Doralee causing office gossip to go wild. The women in the office treat her rudely as a result and initially Judy shuns Doralee's attempts to be friendly.Some time passes and Violet is once again passed over for an important promotion even though her ideas are good enough that Hart passes one off as his own and takes all the credit for it. When Violet protests to Hart that he passed her over for a promotion because she is a woman Hart bluntly tells her that the company would rather have a man in the position and Violet becomes enraged storming off on her own but not before she reveals to Doralee that her affair with Hart is common knowledge. Doralee who has been confused and upset about the way she's treated by her coworkers snaps and also rages at Hart threatening to use her gun on him the next time he makes an indecent proposal. Angry and upset by Doralee's outburst Hart takes it out by firing Maria (Roxanna Bonilla-Giannini) a dedicated employee (due to an infraction overheard by Roz who had been eavesdropping in the ladies' room). After witnessing the incident Judy joins Violet and Doralee in storming out of the office.The three women converge at a local bar to drown their sorrows when Violet discovers a marijuana cigarette that her son left in her purse as a gift. They return to Doralee's house and smoke it together prompting each of them to have a detailed fantasy about how they would take down Hart if they had the chance. Judy imagines a scenario where she's a great white hunter who hunts down Hart in the office with a shotgun. Doralee's fantasy is of her as a cowgirl who turns the tables on Hart and sexually harasses him before roasting him alive on a spit. Violet envisions a fairy tale where she is a Snow White-type character who poisons Hart's coffee and sends him falling to his death from his office window which suddenly releases scores of oppressed ""prisoners"" chained to their desks.Things take a sudden bizarre turn the next day when each of the women's fantasies comes true in some odd respect: Violet accidentally poisons Hart's coffee having mistaken a box of rat poison for artificial sweetener. Before Hart can drink it he falls from his unstable chair and knocks himself unconscious on his credenza desk in his office. Doralee finds him summons an ambulance and accompanies him to the hospital.At first the women have no clue what happened to Mr. Hart but then Violet finds the rat poison realizes what she did and they all assume the reason Hart blacked out was because he drank the poisoned coffee. At the hospital Hart who has regained consciousness leaves on his own without being seen and the three women mistake a dead police witness for their boss steal the dead body (to prevent an autopsy) stash it in the trunk and drive off. After they get into a minor car accident they discover they've stolen the wrong body so they smuggle it back into the hospital. After shaking off a suspicious police officer the three women dispose of the body by taking it back to the hospital and leaving it in a wheelchair in a restroom.The next day they discover that Hart wasn't harmed at all but their discussion about the incident is overheard by Roz. At the end of the day Hart tries to use the information to blackmail Doralee into having an affair with him after all. Doralee loses her temper and ropes Hart with telephone wires when he threatens to call the police (just like in her fantasy) and Judy fires on Hart with Doralee's pistol when he persuades her to untie him (similar to her fantasy).With Hart's wife away on a lengthy cruise the women decide to kidnap Hart and imprison him in his own home until they can somehow get him to cooperate and forget the whole incident. But the cold and misogynist Hart refuses to listen to them and vows to kill them. Looking for a way to blackmail Hart to keep quiet Violet discovers that Hart has been embezzling money from Consolidated by illegally selling inventory from a company-owned warehouse and keeping the profits. The women plan on using the information to blackmail Hart to keep him from calling the police.After purchasing a series of items including a skydiving harness chains dog collars and a remote-controlled garage-door opener to keep Hart confined in his own house the women return to work after the weekend as usual while Violet sends for an order of the warehouse inventories as proof of Hart's embezzlement scheme. She soon learns from the head office in New York City that because of a computer system change the office will not send them the invoices for between four to six weeks.From this point on a race is on to see if Hart can escape or if Violet's documented proof of the scam will arrive in time. The three women work together to make Hart's absence in the office as inconspicuous as possible: flexible work hours equal pay for male and female employees a job-sharing program and even an onsite daycare center for employees with children. Hart's so hated around the office (by male and female employees alike) that the only person to question his absence is Roz whom Violet sends away to Europe for a multi-week training program to learn a foreign language. Hart's archaic and oppressive rules are done away with employee morale improves greatly and productivity improves as well.One night Hart almost escapes when he finds a nail file in the bathroom that his captors overlooked and tries cutting his restraints. Using the restraining system they'd installed in Hart's bedroom Judy is able to render him helpless while he hangs from the ceiling. Judy is further surprised when her ex-husband Dick shows up at Hart's house after following her there and asks to reconcile with her. But when Hart makes a noise Judy is forced to restrain him and seeing the captive Hart tied up her ex-husband mistakenly assumes that Judy is having an affair with her boss and leaves claiming that they are now over and will never get back together.Later Hart is accidentally freed when Missy returns early from her cruise and for three days he quietly buys back all the items he sold and puts them back in the Consolidated warehouse. Doralee only learns about Missy's return when Missy calls her to thank her for her sending her flowers in Hart's name which is why she returned from her vacation early. Doralee hurries to Hart's house to find the freed Hart now holding Judy captive.After taking them to the office to meet with Violet Hart plays his final card boasting that women never can defeat him. Just when it appears as if he is going to send the women to jail a sudden visit from the reclusive and ruthless Chair of the Board Russell Tinsworthy (Sterling Hayden) interrupts him. To the cold and unfeeling Hart's chagrin he finally sees that Violet Judy and Doralee have made some radical changes in the office during his captivity and the sudden surge in productivity has caught Tinsworthy's attention. Where Hart had bristled at the changes in the office -- job-sharing flexible hours new disabled employees working alongside veteran ones a drying-out program for alcoholic workers (Margaret Foster's no longer an alcoholic thanks to the company's alcohol rehab program and Maria's back with the company on a part-time basis and sharing her workload with another employee) -- Tinsworthy congratulates Hart for the increased morale.Since the women did all of it under the false approval of Hart they can take no credit for it but fate seems to be on their side: Tinsworthy ""rewards"" Hart for his good work by immediately removing him from his position and sending him to work on a special project in Brazil much to the amusement and delight of Violet Doralee and Judy as now they are free from Hart who will never try to destroy them without destroying his own career.In the final scene Roz returns from her training and is stunned to discover Violet Judy and Doralee celebrating in Hart's office.In a postscript at the end it is revealed that Violet took Hart's place as vice president of Consolidated Judy married the Xerox technician and quit the company Doralee also quit the company and moved back to her Tennessee hometown where she became a country music singer (just like the actress that played her) and Hart was kidnapped by natives during a trip in the Amazon and was never seen or heard from again."

In 1994 the idea was created for ""Friends"": a show about six friends in New York as they navigate their way through life and learn to grow up as they approach the third decade of their life. All with the help from each other to get them through the obstacles that life naturally has for us. Monica is the excessively neat and organized ""older sister"" of the group who works as a chef while yearning to find her ideal love. Ross Monica's older brother is a paleontologist with a lifelong crush on Rachel. He is a laid-back man with low self esteem and a recent divorcee. Rachel is the pretty bubbly girl who spent most of her life as a spoiled rich princess. Now she must learn to face the real world. Chandler is Ross' college buddy and the guy who will crack jokes at a moment's notice. Phoebe is a lovable eccentric masseuse who easily could have fit in with Haight Ashbury in the 1960s. And Joey the friend who has an inverse relationship between his good looks and his intelligence. He dreams of becoming an actor. These six individuals make up the cast of Friends. In May 2004 Friends officially ended it's phenomenal 10 year run. The show's time slot was taken over by a spin-off called Joey.::ahmetkozan"

Wheeler loves the job but Danny on the other hand hates the job and possesses a constant negative attitude toward life which results in the collapse of his relationship with his girlfriend attorney Beth. Hoping to get his life back on track Danny spontaneously proposes to her; not only does she turn him down she breaks up with him. One day after making a disastrous sales presentation at a high school the duo finds that their company truck is being towed away. They protest by trying to drive it away from the tow truck but end up crashing it into a school statue.Danny and Wheeler are arrested and the judge sentences the two to a 30-day jail sentence. Beth however manages to strike a deal with the judge in which they have to log 150 hours of community service over the next thirty days. The judge selects for their community service a big-brother style program called Sturdy Wings led by Gayle Sweeny (Jane Lynch) an ex-drug addict who takes an instant dislike to Danny and Wheeler. Aware that their presence at Sturdy Wings is court-ordered she warns them that she won't accept any B.S. from them and that if they fail to carry out their tasks to her satisfaction she will have them sent to prison. Wheeler is paired up with Ronnie Shields a foul-mouthed streetwise miscreant obsessed with boobs who has driven away all the other adults he has been paired with while Danny is paired up with Augie Farks a nerdy teenager obsessed with live action fantasy role-playing games.Initially the pair find their task extremely difficult with Danny unable to find any common ground with Augie and his narrow interests and Ronnie taking virtually no interest in Wheeler. After a few days they gradually bond with their respective partners; Ronnie takes an interest in Wheeler's favorite band KISS and discovers that Wheeler shares his obsession with boobs whilst Danny reluctantly participates in Augie's medieval live action role playing group ""LAIRE"". During a Sturdy Wings camping trip Wheeler uses Danny's Ambien to try to have drugged-out sex with another mentor who instead passes out naked in full view of the other children Ronnie and Augie cover for their mentors. At the same time Danny tries to make up with Beth for his mistakes but to no avail.Unfortunately their success is cut short when Augie manages to ""kill"" the arrogant King (Ken Jeong) during one of the role playing games the King lies and says he killed Augie first.

Wanting to apologize to Augie Danny goes to dinner at his house. Augie's mother Lynette (Kerri Kenney) and her live-in boyfriend Jim (Ken Marino) are glad Augie has been kicked out of LAIRE and thank Danny for helping that happen. Seeing how unhappy Augie Danny criticizes Lynette's and Jim's parenting skills.
Wheeler meanwhile takes Ronnie to an adult party in Venice and leaves him unsupervised while he has sex with a blonde he meets at the party. Feeling abandoned Ronnie walks all the way home by himself.Ronnie's and Augie's parents consequently ask Sturdy Wings to assign them new mentors and Gayle throws Wheeler and Danny out. As such the pair is given a court appointment where they will likely have to serve their thirty days in jail. In the elevator Danny berates Wheeler for leaving Ronnie behind while Wheeler scolds him about his whining. The two have a falling out and go their separate ways.Wheeler goes to Ronnie's house and gets permission from Ronnie's mother to hang out with Ronnie after he gets out of jail. Meanwhile Danny looks through his closet and finds the battle attire Augie had given him. Remorseful he secretly meets with the LAIRE king to negotiate Augie's readmission where Augie can fight in that afternoon's Battle Royale the final battle of the year. Danny then sneaks Augie out of his house so they can prepare for the Battle Royal that day but while Danny is visiting Augie learns that the fantasy ""nation"" to which he belongs has expelled his LAIRE team.

Augie's parents Lynette and Jim congratulate Augie for his performance and recognize how happy he is when role-playing. In the after-battle party Augie finally speaks to Esplen who asks him to be her co-regent and the two kisses.

"November 9 1965. Successful Hollywood actress Maggie Garrison is starring in her first Broadway play. She is at the theater more often than she is at home at her New York apartment making her architect husband Peter Garrison feel neglected. Partly as the play only furthers her good girl image - the play titled ""The Constant Virgin"" - Maggie is contemplating quitting the play and retiring to live at her and Peter's Connecticut cottage permanently. Rumors of her retirement do not sit well with the play's director Ladislaus Walichek a secret Peeping Tom who sees in Maggie dollar signs. He believes Peter is the problem the break-up of their marriage which would encourage Maggie to focus on her career which in turn Ladsy would hope would result in Maggie signing a long term contract. Meanwhile Waldo Zane the current Vice-President and Treasurer at Manhattan-headquartered Megatronics Inc. has a plan to embezzle the company's current year's profits of $2.4 million in cash his resolve to do so even stronger when he is passed over for the promotion to President in favor of the current President's nebbish son Otis J. Hendershot Jr. At approximately 17:27 this day a blackout hits the US northeast resulting in general chaos and mayhem. Maggie at the theater at the time is able to make it back to the apartment only to find Peter cheating on her with another woman. As such she runs off to her sanctuary namely the Connecticut house. Waldo in his office at the time of the blackout with a valise filled with the money has one issue after another getting out of the city. He is only able to make it as far as a certain Connecticut cottage. When the power is restored approximately twelve hours later Maggie and Waldo out of the circumstance at hand have no idea what happened overnight the only thing they know being that they were in bed together at some point. Peter who has since come to the cottage initially believes that Maggie had an affair with Waldo in retaliation. Ladsy also at the cottage on Maggie's urging wants to play upon the belief of both Peter and Maggie having had affairs to break up the marriage so that Maggie will sign the long term contract. And Waldo who can't yet leave with no transportation doesn't want to leave anyway as the cash-filled valise is missing it most-likely still somewhere on the property. These lies and misunderstandings lead to one complication after another.::Huggo"

The trouble starts when Puloski's plans for renovating his rundown prison are ruined by his superior Eli Rockwood (Randy Quaid) a greedy businessman who inherited the prison from his deceased parents who rejects his budget request. Rockwood also informs Puloski that his contract as prison warden will not be renewed which means that Puloski will be forced to retire in two months. This comes at the same time that Rockwood is in the midst of selling his company to the very wealthy Gloria Beaumont (Kirstie Alley). Without the funds for a proper remodeling Puloski decides to approach the problem by allowing a group of prisoners Mile-Away (Phil LaMarr) Next-Week (Paul Rodriguez) Jerk-Off (Marty Belafsky) and Ears (Joe Nipote) to leave the prison to burgle a sporting goods store owned by Rockwood (on the condition that they are ""back by midnight"" before the dwarf guard Smitty (Tony Cox) makes his rounds).The plan meets many surprises however complicating Jake's plan including excitable store clerk Lance (Kevin West) and a sadistic security guard (Gilbert Gottfried) with his vicious guard dog named Princess.As Jake distracts Smitty the four bungling prisoners break into the store distract the store's guard dog Princess with the prison's guard dog whom they had fed viagra to earlier that night and make off with their stolen gym equipment but on the way back to the prison one of their truck tires goes flat. As Ears and Jerk-Off look for a tire jack in a farm house Next-Week and Mile-Away try to fast-talk their way past Sheriff Jack Hubbard (Harland Williams) who it turns out is an old school chum of Mile-Away. Jerk-Off finds love with the farmer's sheep alerting farmer Baxter (Blake Clark) who comes out with a shotgun sending Jerk-Off and Ears running away with no tire jack. As Sheriff Jack Hubbard and Mile-Away reminisce Next-Week changes the truck tire with the tire jack Sheriff Hubbard loaned them. After picking up Ears and Jerk-Off from the side of the road the four convicts head back to the prison.The next morning the store security guard discovers that all the store's exercise equipment has been stolen and his beloved dog Princess was ""a slut"". Sheriff Hubbard inspects the crime scene promising Rockwood that he will catch the culprits. The security guard informs them that one of the security cameras was still operational and they may have footage of the culprits; however when they view it they find it has only footage of the two guard dogs.At the prison the convicts are ecstatic with their new equipment and Jake feels very proud of himself. His team of burglars tells Jake that they think they should get the other items the prison needs by robbing the other fifteen stores owned by Rockwood in the area justifying it because Rockwood had been fiddling with their budget in the first place. Jake agrees to the plan since he has only two months left of his contract anyway.As Jake distracts Smitty at the strip clubs Ears Jerk-Off Mile-Away and Next-Week rob Rockwood's other stores of their cash to pay for the renovations to the prison. Rockwood meets with Mrs. Beaumont to discuss their merger while Mrs. Beaumont's pet monkey makes quick work of destroying Rockwood's office.Jake throws a Valentine's dance at the prison inviting the wives and girlfriends of the convicts where Next-Week introduces his girlfriend (Lisa Arturo) and her friend Veronica (Yeardley Smith) to his cousin Carlos (Jsu Garcia). Veronica figures out that the convicts stole money from Rockwood to afford all the changes to the prison and Carlos has to kiss her to keep her quiet. Inside the dance a riot breaks out due to another inmate stealing Jerk-Off's inflatable date resulting in a scuffle (with some brief female nudity) and a fistfight between the inmates.At the police station Sheriff Hubbard discovers that a shoe left by Jerk-Off at the farm belongs to a prisoner uniform at Rockwood's prison. He goes to investigate visiting Mile-Away and after a scene of interrogation Sheriff Hubbard leaves. Mile-Away warns Jake and Jake tells him to spread the word that there will be no more burglary jobs. Rockwood however has other plans. Along with Sheriff Hubbard he creates a trap for the burglars in the form of a big weekend sale. The convicts read about the sale and decide to pull one last job to have some cash for themselves once they re-enter society. But Carlos demands to be a part of the job because he had to kiss Veronica to keep her quiet about the jobs leaving Jerk-Off out of the job.At the store Ears drills into the safe but Next-Week mistakenly leaves his cousin Carlos to roam. Carlos breaks into jewelry cases trying to take them but trips the alarm. Upon opening the safe they find the safe is empty then run outside and are caught by Sheriff Hubbard and the rest of the police department. Mile-Away escapes in the van to warn Jake. Mile-Away admits that they pulled one last job and Jake admits that Rockwood was firing him.Jerk-Off and Mile-Away enter the sheriff's department disguised as guards and manage to free Ears Carlos and Next-Week escaping in the prison van and entering a high-speed chase with Mile-Away riding with Sheriff Hubbard chasing the other burglars.Jake shows up at Rockwood's house trying to confess to the masterminding the burglaries but Sheriff Hubbard calls Rockwood from the road hot on the burglars' trail. Rockwood decides to chase down the burglars himself. Rockwood grabs a gun and has Jake ride with him who are joined by Mrs. Beaumont who has an odd attraction to criminals and high speed chases.The chase ends at the prison where Ears Jerk-Off Next-Week and Carlos zoom through the gate pretending to be prison laundry returning. Rockwood follows them in and notices the changes to the prison and realizes Jake masterminded the robberies. Rockwood says he will turn Jake in until Mrs. Beaumont comes into the prison and tells Rockwood how much she loves how well he treats the prisoners. Mrs. Beaumont says after seeing how he runs his prisons she definitely wants to merge her company with his and have Jake oversee all the prisons. Jake agrees and tells his gang that they need to stop the robberies permanently.A year later Jake narrates saying he retired and finally took the fishing trip he and Smitty had always talked about. Carlos and Next-Week were released first and were greeted by their women Veronica and Next-Week's girlfriend. Ears was released and led a decent life until he cheated on a game show using his super hearing and won a million dollars. Jerk-Off was married to his inflatable girlfriend and started a family; they had an inflatable baby boy. Mile-Away became Sheriff Hubbard's deputy and became a great crime fighting duo ""when they weren't chasing criminals they were chasing each other."""

"On board his millionaire father's tanker ship Nick Kegan (Jeff Bridges) phones his lover Yvette Malone (Belinda Bauer) and leaves a message on her answering machine. Just then a family associate named Keifetz (Richard Boone) arrives on the ship by helicopter with a man wrapped in bandages. Inside a doctor's office the injured man Arthur Fletcher (Joe Spinell) mutters a confession as an orderly transcribes; Fletcher had assassinated Nick's half-brother the President of the United States on February 22 1960. Fletcher claims that he and one other gunman were hired by a man named Casper Jr. for the job after which Fletcher hid his rifle in Room 903 of the Engleson Building in Philadelphia Pennsylvania. Fletcher did so because he waned to be able to prove that he was the real killer. Nick inquires about Willie Arnold the assassin who was determined to be the lone gunman by the Pickering Commission. However Fletcher dies before he can answer so Nick heads to Philadelphia to look for the rifle.At the Engleson Building Nick uncovers the weapon but just as he and his companions prepare to leave a young woman on a bicycle (Barbara Richert) rides past their vehicle and pops her chewing gum. In an instant Nick's associates are shot dead by an unseen sniper. Panicked Nick runs to call his father Pa Kegan (John Huston) but instead is connected to John Cerruti (Anthony Perkins) the mastermind behind the Kegan empire. When Nick reports the incident and his whereabouts Cerruti promises to send help but the vehicle and the rifle inside are stolen by an unseen person as Nick waits.Sometime later Nick is chauffeured to Pa Kegan's desert estate where he is greeted by the Japanese butler Keith (Toshir Mifune). Later that evening Nick sees his emotionally unstable mother Emma (Dorothy Malone) and is rebuked by his father for leaving the ship. When Nick reports Fletcher's confession and the incident in Philadelphia his father storms away. However Pa wakes Nick in the morning with a plan to expose the assassination conspiracy.Sometime later Pa sends Nick to meet his former political rival and one of the richest men in the U.S. Z. K. Dawson (Sterling Hayden). Driving into Dawson's Tulsa Oklahoma ranch Nick is cornered by WW II tanks. Dawson surfaces from a hatch arguing that he was not involved with the assassination and implicating the Philadelphia Police Departments Captain Heller and his sidekick Ray Doty (Michael Thoma).On an airplane to New York City Nick receives a call from Pa who reports that they no longer have witnesses to Fletcher's confession; Keifetz was killed and the ship's orderly broke his neck in a fall. Sometime later Nick meets Doty who remembers that the man implicated in Fletcher's confession Casper Jr. was connected to the Philadelphia police through a club owner named Joe Diamond (Eli Wallach). According to Doty (in a long flashback sequence to the 1950s) Diamond bribed Captain Heller (Brad Dexter) for access into the police station so he could kill Willie Arnold after the presidential assassination. Gangster Gameboy Baker (Ralph Meeker) arranged the assassination because the president did not return favors for the mafia's $2 million campaign contribution and Arnold was their scapegoat.Sometime after his meeting with Doty Nick returns to New York City and makes love to Yvette. In the throes of passion the young woman agrees to marry him but later retracts her promise claiming that Nick is more intimate with her answering machine. When Nick returns home to his apartment he is attacked by his maid but he gains the upper hand and has her detained.At lunch the next day Nick asks Yvette to help him track down Diamond through National Magazine the magazine for which she works. Soon Yvette directs Nick to a Cleveland Ohio diner where he meets gangster Irving Mentor (Irving Selbst) and bribes him for information. Mentor reports that Casper Jr. figured in the assassination because he was connected to a Hollywood studio that lost $50 million when one of their stars killed herself over an affair with the president. Just then the same woman on the bicycle who popped her gum before the shootings in Philadelphia brings a dead cat into Mentor's diner and Nick chases after her as the restaurant explodes. The unknown woman again gets away.Nick returns to New York City where Pa debunks Mentor's story and orders Nick to meet with imprisoned gangster Frank Mayo (Tomas Milian) who was given special leave for the interview. When Mayo suggests that Nick is being misled Nick heads to National Magazine headquarters and learns that Yvette is not actually an employee. Later the hostile doorman (Joe Ragno) at Yvette's apartment insists that she does not live there.Returning home Nick finds Keifetz who admits that he faked his death and encourages Nick to use Cerruti's intelligence connections to find Yvette. At Pa's financial headquarters Cerutti tells Nick that Yvette was kidnapped by Casper Jr. and recounts a new version of the assassination. According to Cerruti (in another flashback sequence) a Washington D.C. madam named Lola Comante (Elizabeth Taylor) who obliged the president's fondness for sex offered him a $2 million campaign contribution from Mayo and his mafia associates. When the president discovered that Pa was behind the deal he ended their relationship leaving Pa financially and emotionally devastated.Changing the story yet again Cerruti confesses that he arranged for Nick to meet a fraudulent Z. K. Dawson in Tulsa. The real Dawson and his daughter Yvette were the true perpetrators of the assassination; Yvette formerly known as Maggie Dawson was the president's mistress. Nick discounts Cerruti's story and insists on learning Yvette's whereabouts. As Nick fractures Cerruti's arms with a baton he breaks down. Cerutti claims that Pa spent millions of dollars to support his son's presidency because it benefited him financially but he was displeased by the president's liberal politics and so it was Pa who had him killed. Pa created an elaborate hoax to confuse Nick including the employment of an actress named Jenny O'Brien to play the role of Yvette. When Cerruti says that Jenny is ""tied up"" at Kegan Medical School Nick leaves... only to find her body in the morgue.Sometime later Nick confronts his father in his office but Pa claims that Cerruti masterminded the assassination to augment the Kegan coffers and blackmailed Pa into keeping quiet. When Nick attempts to call the police Keifetz and an officer break into Pa's office and Nick thinks the men are there to back him up; however Pa announces that Keifetz is an assassin with orders to kill Nick. Defending himself Nick grabs the officer and uses his gun to fire at Keifetz who shoots back at the officer as he dies. Nick chases his father onto the high-rise balcony and finds Pa clinging to the rail of an enormous American flag. As Nick reaches for his father Pa falls to his death tearing the flag in half with his body as he calls out to Nick: ""put my money in South America!"". Nick staggers away but tells the secretary that he will return because he cannot escape his family ties.Sometime later in the final scene Nick calls Yvette's answering machine to hear her voice one last time."

She is surprised to find her sister is alive however still dressed in her cheerleader outfit from yesterday. Samantha who doesn't realize that anything is wrong yet tells Regina that she ran away last night but remembered she didn't have any place to go so she spent the night in the steel garden shed.Samantha has a hard time accepting that all the other people on Earth have been turned to dust by the comet. Regina speculates that the steel of the projection booth and the shed somehow protected them. The girls turn on the radio and find that the local station is still operating so they jump in a car and head into the city to see if anyone is there.They find that the station is completely automated. They also find they have company however. Hector Gomez (Robert Beltran) is a trucker who spent the night in the back of his steel trailer with a girl he picked up. When the two arrived at the city and saw it was deserted  the girl panicked ran off and was eaten by some of the zombies. Hector has also came to the radio station to see if anyone survived.Samantha gets on the air and asks anyone who is still alive to phone the station. She soon gets a call from the scientists at the bunker. They advise her that the comet has caused most of the population to turn to dust. People who only got partial exposure will turn to zombies before they succumb to the same fate. They tell her to stay where she is and they will come and rescue them tomorrow.Hector stays the night but tells Regina that he needs to go to his parent's house in San Diego to see if they survived. He promises he will return.At the bunker Carter (Geoffrey Lewis) the lead scientist argues with Audrey (Mary Woronov) the head doctor. She complains that they should not be bringing outsiders into the bunker. Carter replies that under the circumstances they do not have a choice. As they watch a helicopter arrives carrying two survivors an elementary age boy and girl wearing PJs.Samantha and Regina raid local military armory to get some automatic weapons to defend themselves (Luckily their father also taught them how to shoot). Samantha is depressed as it seems that Regina has already locked up the affections of only available man on the planet Hector. Samantha has also developed a rash something that occurs every time she feels stressed. To cheer her up Regina suggests they go shopping.At his parent's home Hector confirms that his family is dead. He gathers a few keepsakes but has to leave the house in a hurry when he is chased by a zombfied neighborhood boy.The girls hit a large department store and have some fun dressing up in fancy outfits they would never have been able to afford a few days before. Unfortunately they are being watched from the security cameras by a group of former stock boys who now feel they own the store. As the head stock boy taunts them from the PA the others try to grab the girls. This leads to a gunfight. The boys finally capture Samantha forcing Regina to surrender.The scientists arrive at the radio station but find it empty. On a hunch they decide to check the department store.In the basement the boys have chained the girls back-to-back. The head stock boy removes his sunglasses and we see that the boys have been partially exposed and are turning to zombies. They play a game of Russian Roulette putting a gun to Samantha's forehead and pulling the trigger. If it fires the bullet will travel first through Sam's head and out then through the back of Regina's skull killing them both.Before the fatal bullet is fired however the boys are surprised by the arriving scientists who machine gun them down and rescue the girls. The scientists seeing Samantha itching assume she has been partly exposed. They do not tell her that but have her wait with Audrey and another scientist Oscar (John Achorn) for Hector's return while Regina is immediately flown back to the bunker.Audrey injects Samantha with something that causes her to go unconscious. Oscar believes that Audrey has put the girl down to spare her from becoming a zombie. The two argue and Audrey tells Oscar that she no longer wants to be a party to taking survivors back to the bunker. He draws his gun but Audrey is faster with hers and kills him.Back at the bunker Carter tries to question Regina but she is being uncooperative. In another room we see two nurses with two adult males lying unconscious on tables. They discuss how the survivors are being brought to the bunker so they can be used as a source of uncontaminated blood. To make them produce as much blood as possible they are operated on and made brain dead so they simply become blood making machines. The nurses note that they can get 300cc per day out of the men but expect that the children will produce much less. They note that Regina being a young and healthy teenager should produce a large about of blood.Hector arrives back at the radio station to find Audrey who is now very close to going zombie. While she injects herself with a lethal dose of drugs she explains that the scientists accidently left the vents open on the bunker and received a partial exposure. They are tracking down survivors hoping that if they can get enough uncontaminated blood they can create a serum to reverse the effect.At the bunker Regina demands to know where her sister is. Carter who is starting to turn tells her that Samantha has been euthanized before she could become a zombie. Regina is taken by guards to the medical area to prepare her for becoming a blood donor.Samantha is fine as Audrey only gave her a sedative. She and Hector arrive at the bunker and Hector knocks out the guard and rigs the trucks parked outside while Samantha sneaks inside. She finds Regina and they are able to rescue the kids from the nurses just before they were about to start operating. Regina Samantha and the kids escape and run to the car where Hector is waiting. The scientists attempt to pursue them in the trucks but Hector has sabotaged them and they blow up.Back in L.A. the rain has washed away the last of the dust and the sky has cleared. Hector Regina and the two kids have become a family unit. Regina is taking pictures of the them dressed in new clothes. Samantha dressed like she ready to go to the beach waits for them apparently feeling left out. Mocking her sister for not letting the children cross against the stoplight in the deserted city Samantha is nearly run over herself by a racing sports car. It is driven by a handsome teenager who apologies and tells her his name is Danny Mason Keener (Marc Poppel). He invites her for a ride and Samantha is delighted to find a boy her age. As they drive off we see his license plate reads ""DMK."" The credits roll.

A comet wipes out most of life on Earth leaving two Valley Girls fighting against cannibal zombies and a sinister group of scientists.::<crow_steve@hotmail.com>
It's the first comet to buzz our planet Earth in 65 million years and everyone seems to be celebrating its imminent arrival. Everyone except Regina Belmont and her younger sister Samantha two Valley Girls who care more about fashion trends than celestial phenomena. But upon daybreak when the girls discover that they are the only residents of Los Angeles whom the comet hasn't vaporized or turned into a zombie they would do what all Valley Girls do - they go shopping. However with the help of a friendly truck driver the girls save Earth and escape from flesh-eating zombies and blood-seeking scientists in hot pursuit.::Jaime Kidwell
Two sisters high school seniors in the early 1980s awaken one morning to blood red skies and the realization that the human race has been wiped out. This becomes apparent that anyone who was not surrounded by steel when Earth recently passed through the tail of a comet has been reduced to a pile of red dust (the trace elements of human chemical makeup). They encounter a friendly truck driver and take over the airwaves at a local radio station in an attempt to get help. Unfortunately they attract the attention of a group of scientists who knew what the effects of the comet would be. They hide underground in a steel laboratory but carelessly left the vents open. Now as various survivors of the comet who were only partially surrounded by steel are decaying into flesh-hungry zombies the scientists are attempting to come up with a vaccine made of the blood of people who were not infected by the comet. Thus the trio must fight their way past not only roving packs of the cannibal zombies but also outsmart a pack of scientists desperate not to become that way themselves.::Easter Bradford
"Jack Brown (Richard Pryor) is an unemployed newspaper reporter living in Baton Rouge Louisiana who is in danger of losing his house to the bank since he and his wife Angela (Annazette Chase) cannot make their mortgage. After numerous unsuccessful attempts to get a job working for the local paper The Bugle he becomes so desperate that he ends up taking a job as a ""cleaning lady"" for U.S. Bates (Jackie Gleason) an uptight and ruthless businessman who owns the paper and many other businesses in Louisiana. Jack is humiliated as he clumsily attempts to serve food at a luncheon. He is fired but quickly lands a part-time job as a janitor in a department store owned by Bates.The following evening ""Master"" Eric Bates (Scott Schwartz) the 10-year-old spoiled-and-rotten brat son of the boss arrives home from the military academy where he attends and his father sends him to the store and he is told that he ""can have anything he wants in the store"". Amused at seeing Jack goof around in the store's toy section Eric informs his father's long-suffering right-hand man Sydney Morehouse (Ned Beatty) that what he wants is Jack Brown himself. Morehouse fails to convince Eric that human beings cannot be owned. Jack is literally ""boxed up"" and taken to the large Bates mansion that sits on the outskirts of the city. At first Jack refuses to have any interaction with the brat Eric but Bates offers him a deal: in exchange for a generous financial settlement Jack reluctantly agrees to be Eric's live-in friend during Eric's one-week spring break from military school.Emotionally estranged from his father Eric takes a liking to Jack but still manages to humiliate him with numerous pranks during the first day and night. After a particularly humiliating incident in the mansion incited by Bates' ditsy and floozy much younger trophy wife Fancy (Teresa Ganzel) who literally introduces him at a dinner party as Eric's new ""toy"" Jack grows tired of the situation and leaves. The next day Jack agrees to return only when U.S. Bates (with Morehouse as his proxy) offers Jack so much money to be Eric's live-in friend for one week that Jack will not only pay back the bank and numerous bill collectors but Jack will be able to pay back the entire mortgage on his house as well.Jack returns to the Bates estate determined to teach Eric how a friend is supposed to be treated. Over the next several days they slowly bond while participating in mini-cart racing video games and even fishing in a stream filled with piranha. Both Jack and Eric begin to open up to one another with stories about their personal lives. Jack tells Eric about him growing up poor and having to look out for oneself. Eric tells Jack about his mother's death when he was very young which his grumpy father tries to forget about by putting all his time in work and leaving no time for anything else while marrying again and again.Over time Jack sees that Eric isn't the ""bad seed"" that he puts out to people but just a mistreated and neglected boy who wants attention and whom is spoiled by his father. Used to getting things his way since all his father ever does is give him gifts and money (calling it love and affection) Eric throws fits when things do not go his way. Eric is so spoiled and hyper-competitive that he enjoys beating Jack at video games mini-cart racing and board games a little too much. One day when Jack begins winning at a two-person basketball game Eric seeing that he is losing refuses to play anymore and walks off the court. When Jack scolds Eric for quitting because he is losing asks if he would like to tell Eric's father that he is a quitter as well as a sore loser. Eric replies with the most touching and dramatic line in the movie: ""my father doesn't care what I am... as long as I stay out of his way.""Another day later Jack and Eric decide to start a newspaper of their own for fun. After witnessing multiple examples of Bates' cruelty to his housekeeping staff and workers they dig up dirt on him such as a story of how he won his elderly and long-suffering butler Barkley (Wilfrid Hyde-White) in a game of billiards. Jack and Eric then break into Bates newspaper office after-hours as well as the factory to print their paper but get discovered by the police. At a police station Eric manages to create a diversion by setting off some firecrackers creating confusion and panic in which Jack and Eric quietly walk out of their jail cell and out of the front door.Afterwards Jack and Eric publish their paper titled 'The Toy' and distribute free copies of it throughout the city. Morehouse finds a copy and being the ever loyal toady that he is shows it to Bates and he is outraged. Bates quickly calls Jack and Eric to his office to confront them both but he keeps his anger in check. Bates orders Jack and Eric to shut down their paper which he sees as humiliating to him and the Bates dynasty. However Eric is unapologetic and wants to continue the paper. To prove to his son that money can buy anything (including loyalty) Bates offers Jack a reporting job with his newspaper at the end of the week... which is what Jack wanted all along. When Jack accepts Eric becomes upset and runs out of the office. Outside Eric scolds Jack for selling out as all of the people that Bates does business with. Jack tells the boy that most men (especially disenfranchised African-American men such as himself) need jobs just as his priority is to support himself and his wife.At the climax an swanky outdoor party is held at the Bates estate attended by prominent citizens who are supporters of a senator (Ray Spruell). They are unaware that members of the KKK are also in attendance. Jack's wife Angela tries to bring attention to this with her anti-Klan group that are camped on the Bates mansion in a protest demonstration but Jack convinces her to leave. He learns the true reason for the party is to get the KKK Grand Wizard (Orwin Harvey) and Senator Newcomb together in a picture which Bates would then use to blackmail the senator. Senator Newcomb's daughter Honey Russell (Linda McCann) is also in attendance at the party and is accompanied by her husband (Stocker Fontelieu) who is a local district attorney investing Bates for shady business deals and corruption in which Bates is also hoping to get D.A. Russell a photo op with the Grand Wizard to blackmail him too to stop his investigation of his business activities.Jack and Eric team up one last time to disrupt the party and they crash the events on their mini go-carts where Jack announces to everyone about the Grand Wizard's identity. Jack embarrasses the Grand Wizard by causing him to fall into a bowl of chocolate fudge. The Grand Wizard throws a pie at Jack but hits a policeman instead leading to his arrest. Chaos ensues which leads to Jack and Eric driving their mini-carts around the party knocking down tents ruining displays and people jumping out of the path of Jack and Eric's mini-carts into various desert trays which leads to a huge pie-throwing fight among the guests. Bates chases after Jack in a golf cart but ends up crashing into the pool. Jack saves him from drowning since Bates cannot swim and it seems all is forgiven. That evening with the week up Jack packs up and returns to his neighborhood to his wife riding away on a bicycle while Eric sadly waves goodbye.The next day while riding with Eric in a limousine to the airport to return to military school Bates tries desperately to have a heart-to-heart talk with his son but he is not very good at it. All Eric talks about is Jack and that he misses him. Bates tells Eric to forget about Jack. While on the runway to board Bates' private jet Eric runs off making his way to Jack's house. Jack refuses to let Eric live with him and gently admonishes Eric to give his father a chance. Bates shows up and offers the newspaper job to Jack again and promises Eric that next year for spring break he can spend one week with him and one with Jack much to Eric's joy. After they leave the senator's daughter Honey Russell shows up in another limo informing Jack that Fancy has recommended him to look after her son Eugene for a few weeks who is home from his own military academy on spring break. Eugene (Davis Hotard) peeks out from the top window and shoots Jack in the forehead with a toy dart... revealing that he is MORE spoiled and obnoxious then Eric. A crazed Jack runs away down the road in fear over this 'here-we-go-again' situation as the end credits roll."

"A low budget thriller is being shot in the desert. We witness the shooting of a sequence in a diner where Ray the main bad character (played by Christian Slater) threatens everyone in a psychotic way first with speech then with gun. But suddenly the actor falls and then dies apparently from a stroke.The whole team is disorganized and soon challenges the authority of the director who finally has to call the sociopathic producer Harvey Brickman (played by John Turturro) who becomes hysterical on the situation. They decide to send Bonhoeffer (played by Anthony Hopkins) an aging overworked screenwriter to the set in the desert to do some rewrite of the script and find a solution to this mess.But soon the need to satisfy everyone make heat and stress turn to exhaustion imagination to delusion and even hallucination and send the screenwriter's creative process into a confusion between imagination and facts between characters and real people in a whirlwind of images.A much underrated film deserving 7 although one can wonder on the necessity of the structure of the first fifteen minutes editing which instead of establishing the position of the character Bonhoeffer (played by Anthony Hopkins) as the main point of view on the story confuses it with no real benefit because the confusion comes too early. Passed these first fifteen minutes everything goes fine in a ""natural born killers"" hallucination style kind of way.Very good acting.

Naturally the doctor is trying to determine the roots of Young-goon's psychosis but the interview with Mom hints that this may be a family problem; Mom seems none too stable herself. Back in the factory Young-goon is lying on the floor still in her chair and we can see from her right foot that the shock has brought her inner battery up to full strength. Her toes light up to show her state of charge. As all of this is going on we see production credits as circuit board labels uniform name tags and other text scattered around the film.The opening credits covered we then see Young-goon being wheeled around the hospital by what appears to be one of the staff. Other patients are pointed out by this ""staff member"" with many of the other patient's issues being covered. The ""staff-member"" however turns out to be another patient who makes up stories to replace the memories she's lost due to amnesia. At this point we are introduced to Park Il-soon (Rain) who is the reigning ping-pong champion. He wears masks and believes he is capable of stealing other patient's personality traits.A story develops as Park Il-soon seeks to overcome his anti-social tendencies by helping other patients with their problems. In the process he steals one patient's apologetic attitude another's singing voice and Young-goon's sympathy (a sin for a cyborg) so she can kill the ""white 'uns"" who took her granny away. We discover that the ""white 'uns"" are hospital doctors and nurses.As the movie progresses we get to delve into the mental state of a number of the patients. A girl who can yodel Alpine songs but can only view the world through a hand mirror. Another who can fly while lying prone and rubbing her magic socks together. A man who walks backward so no one can sneak up on him. Park Il-soon also steals Young-goon's sympathy so she can kill the ""white 'uns."" With ll-soon's help she has a successful hallucination of killing off the entire hospital staff.In reality she has stopped eating for fear food will gum up her inner (cyborg) workings. Park ll-soon figures this out and fits her with a rice-megatron so she can convert food to electricity. Having fitted her with this device he successfully gets her to start eating again to the delight of staff and patient population. Park Il-soon has his own issues thinking he'll shrink into a dot unless he constantly brushes his teeth. The teeth you see are the last thing to go.Toward the end Park Il-soon has helped a number of other patients with his ability to steal personality traits.At the conclusion he and Young-goon interpret a vision she's had of her granny telling her the meaning of Young-goon's existence. Since Young-goon could not actually hear granny she and Park ll-sun figure out the message via lip reading. Young-goon's purpose it is determined is to explode (she's a nuclear bomb) but she requires a billion volts to pull this off. The two of them figure out that lighting is the best way to accomplish this.Out in a thunderstorm the two of them have a picnic under a tent. They are going to use Young-goon's radio antenna to harness the lightening required to detonate her. The antenna is attached to a wheeled intravenous stand. Unknown to Young-goon Park ll-soon has attached a wine bottle cork to the top of the antenna to prevent any actual electrocution. A fierce wind kicks up blowing away the tent and we find the two sitting on the tarp each clinging to the intravenous stand awaiting a lightning strike. They decide to remove their wet socks and later all of their clothes as they are wet. As morning breaks we see the two of them making love on the tarp watching a rainbow develop on the horizon as the credits roll."

Maria wants to leave the place as soon as possible so they leave the wounded boy on the street. Sherman and Maria drive away and make it back to Manhattan where they swear not to report the incident to anyone.The black teenager who was run over Henry Lamb (Patrick Malone) is found and taken to a nearby hospital where he falls into a coma. Soon after the investigation of Henry's accident begins. The hot-tempered local community leader Reverend Beacon (John Hancock) threatens to create a ""Bronx uprising"" (a race riot) if the police don't find the ""rich white man"" who ran over an ""innocent black teenager"". The reasons for Beacon's involvement is that he merely wants to stir up popular feelings to cause unrest and tension by claiming that Henry's case is a case of institutional racism in America.Under severe pressure NYPD Detectives Martin and Goldberg (Barton Heyman and Norman Parker) investigate all cars which look like the runaway car that was described by various witnesses to the accident. They finally check on Sherman who refuses to let them see his car and because of that he pinpoints himself as a suspect. As a result he gets arrested. Sherman spends a long and demoralizing night in jail (where he presumably gets beaten and harassed by fellow detainees). At his courtroom arraignment the next morning Sherman is so dehumanized from his experience that he can barely speak in court. Sherman's lawyer Tom Killian (Kevin Dunn) enters a not guilty plea on his behalf.The prosecutor Jed Kramer (Saul Rubinek) is very interested in putting Sherman in jail to begin his political career with a strong aim at rich people gaining the popular favor for himself. Against Kramer's protest Sherman is released on bail pending a probable cause hearing to begin the following week.Meanwhile Peter Fallow (Bruce Willis) is an always-drunk good-for-nothing journalist who is forced to investigate the matter in order to ingratiate himself with his boss. Reverend Beacon is interested in stirring popular feelings as well claiming that Henry's hit-and-run case is being used politically as the Jewish district attorney Abe Weiss (F. Murray Abraham) who is the Bronx District Attorney seeking re-election wants to ingratiate himself with the black community in the area. According to Judge Leonard White (Morgan Freeman) almost all of D.A. Weiss' prosecutions end up with black and Puerto Rican defendants going to prison and Weiss is seeking a white defendant for purposes of convincing the community that he is worth re-electing.Following Sherman's release on bail Fallow follows him from the courthouse and onto a local subway train where he interacts with Sherman (without telling him that he is a journalist) to try to get him to open up with facts about the case. Sherman tells Fallow that he was there on that night but was not the one driving the car. Fallow is very surprised but Sherman gets off the train before Fallow can ask him anymore questions.Sherman goes to Maria to plead with her to come forward in order to admit to driving the car that put the black teenager in the hospital but she wants to be left out of the problem. She's married to a wealthy older man named Arthur Ruskin (Alan King) who allows her to have her freedom and plenty of money as a trophy wife. She sublets an apartment to her friend Caroline Heftshank (Beth Broderick) whom Fallow is currently dating. It's a rent-controlled flat so Caroline and Maria are being investigated by the authorities in order to prove that Caroline doesn't live there. Maria has several mics (bugs) put around her flat.Fallow talks to Arthur Ruskin in at a luxurious restaurant about the Sherman case and about Maria's involvment with Sherman. They drink a lot and Fallow tries to get some information from Maria's husband. Ruskin dies from a heart-attack on the spot creating a commotion at the snobbish restaurant.Meanwhile Henry's mother Annie Lamb (Mary Alice) wants to go out and buy new clothes for herself. Suddenly she looks more interested in making the most of the situation than to be with her son in hospital. Beacon accepts the idea. Annie sues the hospital because they're not giving proper care to Henry who still remains in a coma. Reverend Beacon and Kramer meet with Mrs. Lamb where they try to persuade her to testify against Sherman as they work behind the scenes to frame Sherman for the hit-and-run to further advance their own careers... as well as look good in front of the TV news cameras.Elsewhere Sherman who used to consider himself a ""master of the universe"" now is without a job. In just one day he gets fired because his employers do not want any bad publicity for their firm. That evening he arrives home for a party he had forgotten about. Judy angrily tells him that she's leaving him and is taking their daughter with her because Judy also believes the biased news stories about him committing the hit-and-run. Just then Sherman's landlord enters and wants him out of the building as soon as possible because several black people are demonstrating outside the building and they look like a lynch mob which is bad publicity for the building and disturbs the wealthy tenants. Sherman suffers a nervous breakdown and he starts shooting a shotgun at the walls of the apartment. Everybody leaves in a panic.Kramer is trying to play both sides: he puts microphones on both Maria and Sherman in order that the recording proves which one of them was driving the car at the moment of the hit-and-run. Sherman and Maria secretly meet at the funeral of Maria's husband but she seems adamant to have sex. Sherman can't believe it but as usual he's weak with her and was going to fall for it. However she rejects him when she feels the microphone hidden under his clothes.Sherman has lost everything but at least his visiting father (Donald Moffat) backs him up somehow telling him that he loves and will always support him while they are talking Sherman's now empty executive home.Meanwhile Fallow who used to be a downtrodden loser a few days ago feels pity for Sherman who is losing everything and can't even prove that he's innocent. In a restaurant gathering with some fellow newspaper-related people Caroline approaches him telling him that she's lost her flat because of Maria's inability to stay silent. The mic audio recordings have proved that Caroline didn't really live in the flat subletting it with black money. Fallow talks to the guy who had put the microphones (Vito D'Ambrosio) and comes to know the truth. Fallow aquires the recordings and then gives them to Sherman.In court at Sherman's probable cause hearing Judge Leonard White tries to control the proceedings so that there are no political demonstrations. Maria is taken to the stand where she lies by saying that Sherman was driving the car acting as an all-innocent widow. Kramer had given her immunity in order to frame Sherman also threatening her with falsely charging her with perjury if she does not testify against him. Without even telling his lawyer Sherman plays the recording Fallow had given him. In it Maria admits she was the one who had been driving Sherman's car that notorious evening and also mocks her own late husband. She faints on the stand from this turn of events.It works. Judge White has to stop the proceedings when Kramer tries to snatch the mini-tape recorder out of Sherman's hands. Kramer and Sherman's lawyer Killian approach the bench because of the new evidence. Sherman lies by asserting that the tape is all his (making it admissible evidence and it is technically truthful since it refers only to the dummy tape he was holding and ignores the real tape that is hidden which is not his).The courtroom spectators go in an uproar to which Judge White responds by launching a tirade stating that they have no right to act self-righteous and smarmy or above Sherman considering Reverend Beacon claims to help disadvantaged black New Yorkers but actually engages in race baiting or that the District Attorney Weiss pushed this case not in the interest of contempt from justice but in the public opinion in order to appeal to voters from minorities in order to further his political career appealing to their desire to ""get even"". Judge White dismisses the case because of decency and truth in which nobody is interested. Sherman is free to go.Through all of this Fallow is watching everything while standing annoymously among a group of reporters. As a triumphant and relived Sherman leaves the courtroom with his lawyer amind the black spectators who continue to yell and insult him Fallow states in voice-over: ""And that was the last time anyone saw or heard of Sherman McCoy"". After this Sherman left New York City and was never publicly seen or heard of again presumably to live humbly in another state or even in another country in obscurity.In the final scene set five years later in 1990 there is a large audience applauding Peter Fallow's premiere of his very first book titled Bonfire of the Vanities. Reverend Beacon Jed Kramer DA Weiss Tom Killian Judge White Caroline Annie Lamb and the rest of people who had something to do with the case (except for Sherman McCoy) are in attendance. In a final voice-over Fallow states that he never saw Sherman McCoy again but quotes a well-known Bible verse from the Book of Mark Chapter 8 Verse 36: ""What does it profit a man to gain the whole world but lose his own soul?"" Fallow says that Sherman lost everything to gain his soul. Fallow says of himself that he has gained everything but... (he doesn't finish the sentence. It's implied that he has sold his soul to the system in order to become successful).Fallow says that there are always compensations to selling one's soul for success. He stands up and takes an the award he's given concerning the book he wrote about Sherman's case."

Fred Claus has lived his entire life in his brother's very large shadow. Fred tried but could hardly live up to the example set by the younger Nicholas who was just a perfect well saint. True to form Nicholas (a.k.a. Santa Claus) grew up to be the model of giving while Fred became the polar opposite: a fast-talking repo man who's run out of luck and money. Eventually Fred's bad behaviour catches up with him and he is sent to jail. His only recourse is to turn to his brother. Over Mrs. Claus' objections Nicholas agrees to help his brother on one condition: that he come to the North Pole and earn the money he needs by working in Santa's Toy Shop. The trouble is that Fred isn't exactly elf material and cut out for creating toys and spreading good cheer. With Christmas fast approaching Fred could jeopardize the jolliest holiday of the year and ruin Christmas.***********************************************************************************************************************************************************THE FOLLOWING IS NOT COMPOSED BY ME. THIS APPEARS IN ONE OF THE MOVIE SPOILER WEBSITES AND IS WRITTEN BY SOMEONE CALLED 'ILRPinkGirl!'. ITS SO DESCRIPTIVE AND FANTASTIC THAT I DECIDED TO SHARE IT WITH OTHER IMDB USERS. THE TEXT HAS NOT BEEN CHANGED IN ANY WAY AND APPEARS EXACTLY AS WRITTEN BY THE ORIGINAL WRITER.***********************************************************************************************************************************************************The movie begins long ago in a land far far away with Mother Claus giving birth to a baby with her husband and son in the background. As the baby is born the midwife comments on how its the biggest baby shes ever seen. Within a few minutes of his birth the baby starts giggling and saying Ho ho ho! Mother Claus calls her other son Fred over to meet his new brother who she has decided to name Nick. Mother Claus refers to the new baby as her little Saint Nick while Fred promises to be the best big brother ever.Over the next few scenes we see how Nick and Fred develop as people particularly the development of some Christmas traditions. First on Nicks birthday Fred makes a special journal with Nicks name on it as a present. After opening all of his gifts Nick puts them in a box and tells his family he is going to take them to the homeless boy who lives around the corner because giving gifts brings him joy. Mother Claus is obviously very pleased with her son while Fred is angry that Nick is giving away his thoughtful gift. However as Fred gets upset Mother Claus says that Fred should learn to be more like his brother causing Fred to be upset and resent Nick.Since he feels his family does not understand him Fred often climbs a large tree in the woods and visits the only person who understands him: a bird named Chirp Chirp living in a birdhouse in the tree. As Fred confides to the bird about his problems the tree suddenly falls down crushing the birdhouse and causing Chirp Chirp to leave. It turns out Nick cut down the tree; since Fred liked the tree so much Nick thought it would be a great idea to bring the tree inside and put gifts underneath. This is clearly the last straw and causes a permanent rift between Fred and Nick.As we cut to present day the narrator explains that when Nick became a saint due to all his good deeds Nick his spouse and immediate family became frozen in time never to age. While we assume Nick has gone on to become the modern-day Santa Claus we find that Fred now runs a Repo company and is obviously not well liked. He then goes to see his girlfriend Wanda who gets mad at Fred for forgetting that her birthday was tomorrow. She also references that for their anniversary last year he had dropped hints about the Eiffel Tower and having her taking French lessons only to give a bad gift rather than an implied trip to France. Fred promises that theyll be going to a new hotspot for her birthday (although he did not check out the restaurant only naming the restaurant he sees on a billboard).The next day we see that Fred wants to buy a property to open up a gambling facility but needs to come up with $50000 by December 22nd to secure the property. To get money Fred grabs a Santa hat and a tin container and pretends to be working for the Salvation Army to get money. When the real Salvation Army Santas confront him a comical chase ensues ending with Freds arrest. Needing $5000 bail Fred tries calling Wanda who doesnt answer because she is waiting for him at her birthday dinner which turns out to be at a disgusting restaurant where men are watching sumo fights in the middle of the room. The policeman takes pity on Fred and lets him make one more phone call and he calls his brother Nick. Fred tries to convince Nick to send $55000 and Nick almost agrees but Mrs. Claus instructs Nick to use tough love. Therefore Nick says that hell send $5000 to bail Fred out of jail but hell have to come to the North Pole and earn the remaining $50000.Back at his apartment Fred is packing up when a boy named Slam comes in who obviously doesnt have a stable living situation. He talks about wanting a puppy for Christmas but Fred tells him not to count on others for things. At this time family services shows up because his home is unfit and he is moved to an orphanage.Soon after an elf named Willy shows up to take Fred to the North Pole. We learn that Willy is the head elf and has a crush on Santas Little Helper Charlene although she cant even remember his name. Once Fred and Willy arrive at the North Pole Nick welcomes Fred warmly and shows him around including the naughty/nice room. In this room it shows a Top Ten List of the 10 most naughty children at any given time. There is also a humungous snow globe in the room where you can say any persons name and see if theyre being naughty or nice. Fred asks to see Wanda and we see his girlfriend talking to a guy on the street. The man asks Wanda if she has a boyfriend and she says no (obviously upset that he stood her up on her birthday) and they agree to have dinner in the near future. Nick shows Fred where hell be working looking at childrens files and determining if they are naughty or nice.While Fred starts working Nick and Mrs. Claus are introduced to Clyde an efficiency expert who has come to assess workings at the North Pole. He says the group has recently dumped the Easter Bunny and has limited the Tooth Fairy to a one person/one tooth rule. Further if Nick gets three strikes by Christmas Clyde will shut them down.Back at the workshop Fred starts getting restless particularly because the DJ elf keeps playing Here Come Santa Claus on a loop. Fred locks the DJ in a cupboard puts on some dance music and convinces the elves to vacate their stations to join in the dance party. Nick Mrs. Claus and Clyde walk in on this and Clyde says that Nicks inability to control his work staff is Strike #1.That night at dinnertime Nick convinces Fred to come to dinner with their parents and Clyde and its clear that Fred hasnt spoken to his parents in years. Sitting down to dinner Freds mother continues to brag about Nick and still says Fred; you should try to be more like your brother. Fred storms out and heads to Frostys Tavern and has a drink with Willy. Willy discusses his lack of self-confidence regarding Charlene and Fred tries to teach him to dance. Unfortunately Charlene enters the tavern just as Willy falls on his face and runs off embarrassed.Later when everyone else is asleep we see Clyde sitting in Freds office using a shredder to destroy many of Freds naughty/nice records. The next morning while Nick is blaming Fred for the infraction Clyde walks by smirking and says that was Strike #2. Suddenly we hear the Top Ten Naughty List changing and Fred is shocked to see that Slam is now the #1 naughty kid. We see Slam arguing with the other children in the orphanage saying the same types of things that Fred has said to Slam earlier. Fred realizes that children arent really naughty but that theyre just scared or misunderstood. Therefore Fred starts stamping every file as nice and no one as naughty. Nick quickly realizes what Fred is doing and knows that the elves will never make quota if every child is nice and needs toys. Nick and Fred end up in a snowball fight outside which eventually gets physical and causes Nick to pull out his back.Frustrated with his entire family Fred leaves the North Pole with his $50000 as soon as they reach December 22nd but Nick gives him one present to take with him. Fred waits until he returns home to open the gift which is a birdhouse with a note that says Sorry I cut down your tree. Nick. Obviously confused about his feelings towards Nick Fred enters into a Siblings Anonymous meeting where he is joined with the brothers of Alec Baldwin Sylvester Stallone and Bill Clinton. Eventually Bills brother makes a nice speech about how even though he could have ruined everything for his brother who he resented he chose to be a good brother and let him be successful.Back at the North Pole it looks like Christmas is lost: Nick can hardly get out of bed because of his back and Clyde has given Nick Strike #3 because Fred marked everyone as being nice rather than a mix of naughty and nice. However 10 hours before the deliveries should start Fred shows up! It turns out he used the $50000 to charter a plane boat and sled dogs to get back to the North Pole and help out. Without Clydes knowledge Fred and the elves work tirelessly to make at least one toy for each child with no reference to if theyre naughty or nice. However Nick still cant drive the sleigh and only a Claus can deliver the toys. So Fred decides to be a good brother and deliver the toys. With Willis help in the sleigh (and elves back at the North Pole serving as mission control) Fred starts delivering presents around the world (including giving a puppy to Slam and telling him to care about others) but has to be back to the North Pole before sunrise otherwise Christmas will be permanently shut down. Fred starts delivering toys albeit without any gracefulness with the help of Willy and the other elves. However halfway through the night Clyde pulls the electricity at the workshop so that the elves can no longer give directions to Fred and Willy. While Fred and Willy try to finish delivering the gifts Nick goes to talk to Clyde finally realizing why he was holding such a grudge. It turns out that as a child Clyde had always wanted a Superman cape but had always been on the naughty list. Nick gives Clyde the cape he had always wanted ending the grudge between the two. Clyde tries to turn the electricity back on but it still wont work so Fred and Willy are on their own.All the elves wait nervously at Frostys tavern and are upset to see dawn approaching. But at the last minute Willy and Fred return successful in their efforts. Willy we a renewed confidence goes to kiss Charlene who can now remember his name and obviously returns the sentiment. With Christmas saved Fred returns to Wandas house but she is still furious with him. However Fred feels renewed hope when we find out she never met the other guy for dinner and gives her a present. She opens it to find a teddy bear holding a French flag implying that he is going to keep his promise to go to France.As the movie concludes we see how everyone is doing now: Fred and Wanda got back together and used the sleigh to travel to Paris and see the Eiffel Tower. Charlene and Willy are now happily together. Clyde now works at the North Pole as a consultant and helps the elves to meet quota without problems. Finally we see Fred and Wanda meeting with Nick Mrs. Claus and Mother and Father Claus meeting for dinner showing that theyve reconciled and come together as a family. As we pan out of the last shot we see the birdhouse right outside where everyone was having dinner and see a bluebird landing and chirping happily.

To her dismay Jenna learns she and ""Mattie"" have been estranged since high school when Jenna fell in with the in-crowd and that Matt is now engaged.This is complicated by the fact that Jenna has become a shadow of her former self.

Unknown to Kessel Joe has been devising a plan with his girl friend American exaptriate prostitute Dawn Divine to take the contents from bank safe-deposit boxes owned by several criminals and place them into one owned by Dawn. As Joe explains to Dawn the theft will be beyond the law because the thefts of illegal funds can never be reported. Joe's plan depends upon his intellect and knowledge of the bank's expensive vault coupled with information that Dawn supplies to him about some of her clients: Sarge an American sergeant who is involved in the black market and has recently graduated to smuggling heroin; Mr. Las Vegas an attorney who is helping his Las Vegas clients evade taxes; and Candy Man a sadistic killer and drug dealer. Although Joe has arranged for his friend Helga a striptease dancer at a gangster-run nightclub to report on Candy Man she is killed apparently after arranging for Dawn to meet Candy Man and accompany him on a flight to Copenhagen. Unknown to Dawn Candy Man is to deliver some concentrated LSD that he has poured into an empty champagne bottle. On the flight he gives Dawn the champagne to carry in her bag telling her to save it for later. Upon their arrival in Copenhagen though she is stopped by customs officials who say that they were given a tip (from Joe) that she might be smuggling drugs into the country. While they are questioning her Candy Man surreptitiously takes the champagne and walks away. When Dawn is let go by the authorities she returns to Hamburg to the relief of Joe who did not find out about Helga's death until after it was too late to stop Dawn. On the day of the heist which Joe had already announced was his last before returning home Joe sets his plan in motion by telling some of the bank employees to watch out for a suspicious-looking man with a scar. At the specified time a nervous Dawn who has been practicing her lines all morning calls and whispers a threat to blow up the bank if Kessel does not give a man with a scar the gold bar on display in a secure case in the lobby. A nervous Kessel alerts Joe who goes with him to retrieve the gold bar then quickly grabs it and runs into the vault as he orders the clerk to shut the vault door immediately. Kessel and the others at the bank are amazed by Joe's bravery but worried when they realize that he had left the key to open the vault from the inside on his desk. Kessel communicates with Joe through the bank's video security system and assures him that the police are on their way and will look for the bomb. He also insists over Joes assurances that he will be fine and Kessel should not ruin a $50000 door on using a blowtorch to break the vault's lock because he fears that the air will not last until the next morning when it would automatically open. After the police determine that there was no bomb scores of spectators and media arrive at the bank. While his plight is being reported extensively on German television Joe quickly unlocks and empties the targeted safe-deposit boxes placing the content of each into Dawn's box and timing his activities to avoid the security camera's sweeping lens. Meanwhile thousands of people throughout Germany are watching television and hailing Joe for his bravery even Sarge and Mr. Las Vegas. When the welder finally breaks through the vault door Joe has completed his job and the safe-deposit boxes appear to be untouched. The next day when Sarge comes to empty his safe-deposit box he sees Joe and congratulates him for his ""American know how"" and bravery. As Sarge and Candy Man go into private rooms to open their respective safe-deposit boxes they are stunned to find them empty as is Mr. Las Vegas who collapses in shock. Meanwhile Dawn who has entered the bank and taken the contents of her safe-deposit box now bursting with cash and Candy Man's champagne bottle is barely able to leave the bank without the assistance of an eager Kessel who finds her attractive. As the day goes on Candy Man is threatened by his drug contacts for not having their money and Sarge believing that his partner the Major has robbed him starts to beat him up until Candy Man arrives and tells them that only the people who could not report their theft had been robbed. As they ponder what has happened Candy Man sees a photograph of Sarge and Dawn then takes Sarge and the major to her apartment. Although Sarge thinks that Dawn is ""a dumb broad"" incapable of being involved in the robbery they find Joe's name and telephone number in her address book then call him and quickly hang up. Candy Man who says he does not believe in coincidences or heroes waits while Sarge calls Kessel to ask for Joes address saying that he is a friend who lost his address. Kessel is at first reluctant to reveal the information but relents when Sarge says that he needs it for a party which Kessel assumes is Joe's going away party. Kessel then has second thoughts and calls Joe to inform him what he has done. Joe tells him that it is not a problem then quickly packs up all of the cash that he and Dawn have been counting. Dawn adds the champagne bottle to the suitcase she will take then on Joe's instructions drives away in his car just as Sarge the major and Candy Man arrive. While the Major follows Dawn Sarge and Candy Man pursue Joe into his building then through the backstreets and rail yards of Hamburg. Meanwhile Dawn eludes the major by boarding a train that is about to leave then jumping off as it pulls out of the station. Sarge and the Candy Man continue to chase Joe through the city and the Elbe Tunnel before Joe makes his escape from Hamburg by hiding in a car being transported on a car hauling trailer. Early the next morning Sarge and Candy Man see the trailer out in the country and moments later spy Joe walking through the snow. They jump into Sarge's car and follow the road around a frozen lake and when the car gets stuck in some slush Candy Man jumps into another car and drives out onto the lake. As Candy Man drives back and forth trying to run down Joe the ice begins to crack and the car sinks sending him plunging to his death in the icy water. Now Joe starts to run toward a moving train as Sarge gets into his car and follows. Some time later as Joe is sleeping in a compartment on the train Sarge puts a gun to his head. He demands the money but when Joe opens the suitcase it contains only old newspapers and the bottle of champagne. Joe then says that Dawn has cheated all of them and convinces Sarge to work together to find her. They decide to open the bottle of champagne to seal the deal but while Joe looks at his glass and wonders why there are no bubbles Sarge drinks straight out of the bottle and almost immediately begins to writhe in pain as the concentrated LSD takes effect. When the train arrives at the next station Joe throws the suitcase into the trash and walks away. Some time later Dawn checks into a Southern California resort and is happily reunited with Joe telling him that she knew that they would never kill him as long as he did not have the money."

"The movie comprises two different stories told one after the other each about a romance involving a policeman. Aside for a brief moment when the first story ends and the second begins the two stories do not interconnect. However the three main characters from the second story each momentarily appear during the first.First storyThe first story concerns Taiwan-born cop He Qiwu also known as Cop 223 (played by Kaneshiro). Qiwu's girlfriend May broke up with him on April 1 (April Fool's Day). His birthday is May 1 and he chooses to wait for May for a month before moving on. Every day he buys a tin of pineapple with an expiration date of May 1. By the end of this time he feels that he will either be rejoined with his love or that it will have expired forever. Meanwhile a woman in a blonde wig (played by Brigitte Lin) tries to survive in the drug underworld after a smuggling operation goes sour. On May 1 Qiwu looking for romance approaches the woman in the blonde wig at a bar (the Bottoms Up Club). However she is exhausted and falls asleep in a hotel room leaving him to watch movies alone. She leaves in the morning and shoots the drug baron (played by Thom Baker) who had set her up. Qiwu goes jogging and receives a message from her on his pager wishing him a happy birthday. He then visits his usual snack food store where he collides with a new staff member Faye. At this point a new story begins.Second storyIn the second story the unnamed Cop 663 (played by Tony Leung) is similarly dealing with a breakup this time from a flight attendant (Valerie Chow). He meets Faye the new girl at the snack bar (played by Faye Wong). She falls for him in secret and frequently breaks into his apartment during the day to redecorate and ""improve"" his living situation. Gradually her ploys help Cop 663 to cheer up and he eventually realises that Faye likes him and arranges a date at the restaurant 'California'. However Faye stands him up after a last-minute decision to see the world before settling down; she leaves him a fake boarding pass with a date a year from now. In the last scene Faye arrives back in Hong Kong now a flight attendant; she finds that Cop 663 has bought the snack bar and is converting it into a restaurant. Their future however always remains ambivalent."

He goes through a daily ritual to deal with the news he hoping the break up is a joke seeing as to the day she tells him. That ritual will end on May 1 - his twenty-fifth birthday - which if she does not return to him by then he will come to the conclusion that it is not a joke and try to move on without her. The day of his birthday is altered not by May's return but by his encounter with an Asian woman wearing a trench coat and a blond wig to who he is instantly attracted not knowing that she has had a difficult day in her ""job"" as a drug smuggler.

"In 1933 in a castle located high in the Himalayas master criminal Dr. Fu Manchu (Peter Sellers) celebrates his birthday by demanding a vial of ""elixir vitae"" a fountain-of-youth potion responsible for his 168 years of life. When a follower (Burt Kwouk) presents the elixir his clothing catches fire from the candles on the birthday cake so he douses the flames with the elixir. Fu Manchu orders the follower tortured and killed then announces to his other bandit followers the Dacoits that they must carry out several international robberies to gather the precious ingredients for more elixir.In America a Dacoit is sent to a Washington D.C. museum where he observes the Star of Leningrad diamond and learns that Czar Nicolai presented an identical canary diamond to his cousin King George V that is on display in London. At night the Dacoit steals the jewel.In London FBI agent Giuseppe ""Joe"" Capone (Sid Ceasar) and his assistant Pete Williams (Steve Franken) visit Commissioner Roger Avery (David Tomlinson) and his nephew and assistant detective inspector Robert Townsend (Simon Williams) at Scotland Yard to discuss the case. When Commissioner Avery is shown a clue he immediately recognizes it as belonging to the Si-Fan the dangerous secret Asian crime organization headed by Fu Manchu. The FBI agents ask to speak to Inspector Nayland Smith (Peter Sellers in a dual role) an authority on the Si-Fan but learn that he is retired.When the Scotland Yard police and the FBI special agents journey to Smith's country home to coax him out of retirement the retired Inspector examines the evidence and corroborates that the robbery is the work of the Si-Fan. Although Joe Capone believes that Fu Manchu died in 1890 Smith claims that the criminal is alive and well. Just before Smith's retirement Fu Manchu was responsible for three unrelated diamond robberies. Smith explains that all three jewels represented key ingredients of the elixir vitae that Fu Manchu needs to maintain eternal youth.Later Smith agrees to work on the case when he deduces that Fu Manchu is assembling a fresh batch of elixir and will strike next to obtain the George V canary diamond displayed in the Tower of London. There museum director Sir Nules Thudd assures Commissioner Avery that the jewel is safe behind bars guarded by a sophisticated alarm system with several guards standing duty. Meanwhile as Fu Manchu's strength diminishes he receives electric jolts to his heart that temporarily restore his vitality.At lunch Smith shares his theory that Fu Manchu will kidnap the royal couple and demand the jewel as ransom instead of stealing the diamond outright. He proposes that Scotland Yard plant decoys to outsmart Fu Manchu. The agents hold auditions to recruit the royal doubles from within their ranks to foil the predicted kidnapping and Constable Alice Rage (Helen Mirren) is chosen to assume the role of Queen Mary. When Alice impersonating the Queen makes a speech at the Botanical Society she and surrounding officials fall unconscious after breathing the vapors of a deadly plant strategically left by Dacoits. However the kidnapping plot fails when the kidnappers are unable to move the ""Queen"" because Smith has handcuffed her to a railing.Soon King George informs Commissioner Avery that the royal couple plans to attend the theater so the police alter their strategy. With binoculars Smith sees several Dacoits waiting to strike but warns the FBI to wait. When the royal couple appears at their box seats five sets of identically dressed impostors join them as the national anthem plays. As a result of the confusion the royal couple is saved and the Dacoits are arrested.Later Fu Manchu disguises himself as Charles Rotten an antique dealer that the Queen is scheduled to visit. When Rotten shows Alice some new tapestries the undercover agent is kidnapped. She is transferred to a secret location in back of a Chinese restaurant where she informs Fu Manchu and the Dacoits of her real identity. Before she places them under arrest Fu Manchu serves Alice a glass of rare and addictive wine. Soon villain and policewoman are singing a music hall duet when a restaurant worker informs Fu Manchu that Nules Thudd is dining at the establishment. Fu Manchu instructs the Dacoits to have Nules tortured by Dr. Arnold Wretch an obesity specialist.Meanwhile Alice agrees to play the saxophone as Fu Manchu offers her a lifetime of luxury if she becomes his consort. For treatment Wretch orders Nules to walk on stilts in a park where Fu Manchu tempts him with a Chinese banquet. Alice pretending to be an aristocrat hosting the party introduces Nules to Fu Manchu disguised as chef Fu. Fu suggests that Nules can enjoy the banquet in return for Fu being allowed to look at the King George V diamond. After Fu Manchu has stolen the diamond and the Crown Jewels of England he informs Nayland Smith by phone that he has gathered all the elixir ingredients and mayhem will follow.In pursuit of Fu Manchu Smith and the other agents travel to the retired Inspector's home which transforms into a hot air balloon that transports them to Nepal. Meanwhile Alice has joined Fu Manchu at his castle where he discovers his freshly made elixir is defective. When the Dacoits surround and shoot at Smith's cottage after it lands Smith demands to see Fu Manchu.At the castle Smith confesses that the police planted a fake jewel and agrees to surrender the real George V diamond if Fu Manchu will return the Crown Jewels. When the other police officers arrive at the castle Smith admits that he saved their lives by giving the real diamond to Fu Manchu. Drinking the improved elixir vitae shaves years off of Fu Manchu's life. Alice distributes the missing Crown Jewels to the British officers and the FBI agents receive the Star of Leningrad diamond. For Smith Fu Manchu has prepared a small bottle of elixir vitae but warns him not drink it until he returns to England. Fu Manchu also suggests that ingesting the elixir will expose Smith to forces he will not be able to resist. When Smith asks for a clue to prepare him for what might happen the lights dim and Fu Manchu transforms into an Asian Elvis Presley and launches into a rock and roll song ""Rock A Fu"" with the Dacoits singing backup."

"It is September 1961 two years after the original Grease gang were Rydell High seniors in the first movie and a new academic year is just beginning at Rydell High School ('Back To School Again'). The Pink Ladies are now led by the beautiful Stephanie Zinone (Michelle Pfeiffer) who feels she has ""outgrown"" her relationship with the arrogant leader of the The T-Birds Johnny Nogerelli (Adrian Zmed) during summer break. A new arrival comes in the form of clean-cut English student Michael Carrington (Maxwell Caulfield) the cousin of Sandy Olsson (the character played by Olivia Newton-John in the first Grease movie). Michael quickly becomes smitten with Stephanie despite the gentle warning of the sole remaining lead character from the first film Frenchy (Didi Conn) who is returning to Rydell High to get her diploma was told about Michael's arrival in a letter from Sandy and helps Michael get settled into the school atmosphere as Sandy's behest. Michael takes an instant liking to Stephanie but Frenchy tells him that she will not date him since he is not a T-Bird.At the local bowling alley a competitive game ('Score Tonight') turns sour due to the animosity between Johnny and Stephanie. Johnny flirts with Stephanie's friend and fellow Pink Lady Paulette Rebchuck (Lorna Luft) to make Stephanie jealous and she retaliates by kissing the next man who walks in the door which happens to be Michael. Bemused by this unexpected kiss Michael attempts to ask her out the next day at an audition for the school talent show but discovers that she has a very specific vision of her ideal man ('Cool Rider'). He realizes that he will only win her affection if he turns himself into a cool rider and begins saving up for a motorcycle by selling completed homework assignments to the academically-challenged T-Birds. Michael buys the bike fixes it up and spends all his spare time after school learning to ride it.At school a few days later there is an an unusual largely interactive biology lesson ('Reproduction') given by new substitute teacher Mr. Stuart (Tab Hunter) over sex education. That evening a gang of rival motorcyclists called the Cycle Lords (led by Balmudo who also played ""Leo"" in the first film and also a rival of the T-Birds) surprise the T-Birds at the bowling alley. Before the fight starts a lone anonymous biker wearing all black clothing as well as a motorcycle helmet and dark goggles to cover his face appears and defeats the enemy gang performing impressive stunts and leaping over police cars to disappear into the night ('Who's That Guy?'). Stephanie is instantly fascinated with the stranger.The following day at school Frenchy tells Michael about that motorcycle chase and a strange guy swept Zinone out of her bobby socks. Michael confides in Frenchy he's the one and just as he was about to tell Frenchy his game plan Zinone and the other Pink Ladies come into the room. That's when Michael attempts to tell Stephanie that he is the ""Cool Rider"" but becomes tongue-tied. Frenchy notices a patch on Rhonda's nose. (She is also wearing glasses similar to the ones Dinah Manoff wore at one point during the first movie when she played Marty.)In a short comic scene one of the T-Birds Louis DiMucci (Peter Frechette) attempts to trick his sweetheart Sharon (Maureen Teefy) into losing her virginity to him by taking her to Michael's uncle's fallout shelter and faking a nuclear explosion ('Let's Do It For Our Country') but the plan backfires and she runs off in horror.Stephanie is surprised again by the Cool Rider while working at her after school job at her family's gas station and they enjoy a romantic twilight motorcycle ride. Just as Michael is about to reveal his identity they are interrupted by the arrival of the T-Birds and the Pink Ladies; before Michael disappears again he tells Stephanie that he will see her at the talent show in which the Pink Ladies and T-Birds are performing. Stephanie wonders how the Cool Rider knew about the talent show but fails to deduce it could be a Rydell High School student since only they knew about the show. Johnny enraged by Stephanie's new romance threatens to fight the ""Cool Rider"" if he sees him with her again and the group has an argument about who belongs to whom. The Pink Ladies exit haughtily although this has little effect on the T-Birds' innate self-confidence as they stroll off in the night ('Prowlin').At school Stephanie's poor grades in English lead her to accept Michael's offer of help with her essay on Shakespeare's Hamlet but although she has warmed to him considerably he still cannot reveal his double identity.By this point Stephanie has begun to realize that despite his shy bookworm outward appearance Michael is a kind good hearted guy who genuinely cares about her. She then slowly begins to discover that she has similar feelings for him and starts to reciprocate his crush. These events are not lost on their mutual acquaintances and Johnny upon seeing them together in a discussion demands that Stephanie quit the Pink Ladies for his ""rep"" and subtly threatens that the T-Birds will beat up Michael if she refuses (""Don't damage the rep we won't damage new friends.""). Stephanie is visibly upset by this but refuses to quit the Pink Ladies. Although still head over heels for the Cool Rider interactions with Michael reveal that she has become smitten with him as well as Michael ponders with himself over his continuing charade he puts out to Stephanie. ('Charades').The night of the talent show Stephanie and the Cool Rider meet outside the school but are instantly ambushed by the T-Birds who pursue Michael in a motorcycle chase with Stephanie and the Pink Ladies following in a car. They pursue him to a closed-off construction site which conceals a deadly drop and the biker's absence suggests that he has perished below leaving Stephanie inconsolable thinking her Cool Rider is dead although both the T Birds & Pink Ladies try to convince her that he must have survived and made the jump and will show up again.At the talent show the T-Birds tie up the competition for their act in the boys locker room and drench them in the showers to ensure their winning. During the Pink Ladies' number ('A Girl For All Seasons') Stephanie is overcome and stops singing her part and sinks to the stage floor. Oblivious to the audience she enters a dreamlike fantasy world where she is reunited with her mystery biker in a sort of ""biker heaven"" backdrop ""([Love Will Turn] Back The Hands Of Time)"". As her reverie finishes it appears she has been singing a solo; she is duly named winner of the contest and crowned the queen of the upcoming luau with Johnny hailed as king.The school year ends with the graduation luau the next day ('Rock-A-Hula Luau') during which Johnny and Stephanie later engage in another argument while being carried onto the pool in a floating throne. The Cycle Lords suddenly appear and begin to destroy the celebration but are stopped by the emergence of the Cool Rider much to the surprise of Stephanie. After roundly defeating the Cycle Lords and leaping over the pool on his motorcycle he finally reveals himself to all in attendance to be Michael. After his initial shock Johnny offers him a T-Bird jacket and welcomes him into the gang and Stephanie finally accepts that she can have ""two for the price of one"" a Cool Rider and a Shakespeare. All of the couples pair off (Michael/Stephanie Johnny/Paulette Lewis/Sharon Davey/Dolores & Rhonda/Goose) happily at graduation as the class of 1962 (Note: Davey was not a senior so he doesn't graduate then) sings ('We'll Be Together'). The credits start rolling and just like in the first movie it's in the style of a yearbook.

"In the amusing opening sequence in silent movie style the routine and regimented activities of Fred Hill (Henry Kendall) at work and his navigating the rush hour going home are choreographed to a musical score. The long rows of desks the masses going down stairs at exactly 6 PM the crowd of bowler hats the umbrellas the crushing indignities of transportation in the underground are highlighted. Fred annoys many around him as he ineptly tries to read a newspaper.Fred and his wife Emily (Joan Barry) are an average couple living a boring middle class life in London. Emily prepares steak and kidney pie every other day and sews clothes on the dining room table to economize. He begrudges their lot while she accepts it. Their black cat believes his rightfully place is atop the dining room table and Fred shoos him down with repeated annoyance.One day they receive a letter from an uncle announcing they will receive a small fortune as an advance against a future inheritance. They believe that the unexpected extra money will bring them happiness. Fred takes leave from his job as a clerk and they leave on a rich people's world cruise.Fred first shows his susceptibility to sea sickness while crossing the English Channel.In Paris the two go sightseeing. A montage of famous landmarks is shown with their heads flipping suddenly from left to right over and over.Both are scandalized by the topless women dancers at the Folies Bergre. Both of them drink too much. As they ride the hotel elevator Fred sets his watch to agree with the floor number dial and is very puzzled by the quick changes in the number. As he is about to get into bed he stumbles and falls on his knees in a night prayer position.After sailing out of Marseilles they at first enjoy a cruise life: drinks dancing pool and deck games strolling on the decks. However Fred's sea sickness interferes day after day. When a steward enters the stateroom to offer him food he is so nauseous the menu item names jump out at him.Comedy relief is provided by a spinster with thick glasses (Elsie Randolph) in search of a man any man about the cruise ship oblivious to how she is constantly making a fool of herself. (Hitchcock often features a plain-looking woman in glasses in his films.)Commander Gordon (Percy Marmont) a dapper popular bachelor initiates conversations with Emily to get away from the spinster. Emily finds it easy to talk to Gordon. They soon talk about the characteristics of love and marriage. Gordon has never been in love. Emily says she finds it difficult to talk to Fred because she fears displeasing him with what she says because she loves him so much. Gordon shows Emily photographs of himself sitting next to an empty chair in his house near Singapore. Emily draws a cartoon of herself sitting in the empty chair.Finally feeling well enough to appear on deck Fred is immediately smitten with a German ""princess"" (Betty Amann) who meets him while retrieving the rope ring used to play deck tennis.The affairs developing are shown by increasingly pairing the lovers together in one shot and how they sightsee separately in Port Said.Emily and Gordon's first kiss is broken by the abrupt stop of accordion music being played on the deck below as an argument breaks out.In an intensely awkward scene Fred tries to kiss the princess who is wearing a harem costume and he can't figure out how to get around the veil covering her face.After Fred agrees to meet the Princess in stateroom 19 all numbers he sees turn into 19 in huge sizes.As the ship arrives in Singapore each plans to abandon the marriage to run off with a newfound love.The collapse of the marriage is symbolized when the couple are riding in rickshaws going in opposite directions get wedged together so that neither can proceed and neither is willing to make way for the other.Emily leaves with Gordon for his nearby home. Gordon offers her a decent life saying outright that her husband is hopeless and that she and Fred are horrible together.When Gordon reports that the Princess is a con artist the daughter of a Berlin laundry owner a common adventuress who often undertakes to relieve wealthy men of their money Emily realizes she wants to protect Fred because he's such an impractical wimp and returns to Fred in his hotel room where she finds the Princess and Fred preparing to leave for Burma.The Princess leaves the room after telling Emily that she's stupid not to leave Fred for Gordon.Fred and Emily take some time to try to talk things through. Fred's frustration is taken out multiple times on the janitor who enters the room to clean by screaming at him to get out.Fred is told the Princess is a fake a fact that is confirmed soon after. She has embezzled 1000 pounds from him and taken off for Burma alone. Warning Emily not to tell him ""I told you so"" he advises her not to rub it in.Emily gets a touching farewell letter from Gordon and the letter blurs out of focus as her eyes fill with tears.The couple are left with barely enough money to pay their hotel bill and to book passage home on a cheap tramp steamer.The ship suffers an at-sea collision while they sleep.In a scene shot entirely within the stateroom they hear the collision noise Fred is knocked out and while Emily tends to Fred shouts of ""Abandon Ship!"" are heard followed by loud thumping noises of people running and scrambling onto lifeboats. When Fred recovers consciousness they find their stateroom door is jammed tight they can't leave and no one pays attention to their knocks and cries for help. The sounds recede the power goes off water levels are slowly rising they hug to comfort each other and resign themselves to die together vowing that they both were each others great love in life after all.At first light the ship has pitched somewhat so they see they can exit by the porthole and find the ship derelict and drifting the other survivors having all been rescued.They're in their night clothes so they find in another stateroom something to put on ""in case somebody comes"". They step over a dead crew member find a brandy bottle and gulp down a drink. A black cat exits to the outer deck in front of them. Further sinking seems inevitable so Emily talks about what to do: ""Perhaps we should find a raft or something."" Soon they sight a Chinese junk approaching.The Chinese crew of the junk boards quickly and begins to search for stuff that can be salvaged paying scant attention to Fred and Emily who transfer into the junk.Only a few moments later the steamer gives a shake and a lurch a warning that it may sink at any minute. The Chinese crewmen quickly abandon the steamer transferring to the junk only the black cat and a few items then slowly retreat from the sinking ship.One sailor in the mad scramble gets one foot caught in a rope and dangles head down attached to the sinking ship and drowns while Fred Emily and his comrades watch in helpless fascination. The large ship goes down.The junk's cook a very pregnant woman brings two bowls with food to Fred and Emily which they first try to eat with chopsticks. They find the dish tasty and wolf it down one handful at a time. After they finish they notice a black cat's pelt being stretched out to dry. They realize they've inadvertently eaten the cat!Some time later they hear baby cries and see a group gathered at the kitchen door so they figure the cook's baby has been born. The man who seems to be the father carries the crying baby in his arms and bathes it by simply pouring a bucket of cold sea water over it. Emily's maternal instincts are aroused and she becomes indignant at the rough treatment. ""Leave them alone"" advises Fred ""The Chinese breed like devils anyway.""After several days aboard the junk they approach land.They enter their old apartment together and happy. Steak and kidney pudding and an ordinary life should do just fine from now on. Fred has really changed since he takes the black cat down from the dinner table affectionately.In the last shot the pair are seen arguing in a manner reminiscent of the scene prior to the arrival of the uncle's letter only it is SHE who wants changes like a bigger house and HE is satisfied with the status quo.

"Harold Crick (Will Farrell) is an IRS auditor who almost compulsively measures quantifies and rationalizes his life. Suddenly he becomes aware of a voice narrating his life ""accurately and with a better vocabulary."" The voice is that of a writer we learn is struggling with writer's block (Emma Thompson) mostly about the best way to make Harold die. When Harold overhears his impending doom he takes action and eventually makes his way to a professor of literary theory (Dustin Hoffman) who helps him understand the implications of the narrative life he is leading. The main story line seems to be around a woman he is auditing played by Maggie Gyllenhaal.
Realizing he could die at any moment Harold begins to break free of his limited orderly life and joins Gyllenhaal in a romantic relationship. He tracks down Thompson and confronts her with the truth: if she writes about his death then he will die. But Hoffman is convinced the novel must be written as intended and Thompson herself is ambivalent. Crick himself reads the novel and encourages her to keep the original ending which would kill him. Eventually Thompson writes of the fatal accident but makes the accident only near-fatal. ""If you have someone who willingly knowingly goes to his death well...isn't that the kind of person you want to keep alive?"" In the end there is an ode to Harold Maggie Dustin and most of all Harold's wristwatch.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Harold Crick (Will Ferrell) is an auditor for the Internal Revenue Service living his entire life based on the timing of his wristwatch. He is given the job to audit an intentionally tax-delinquent baker Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal) to whom he is awkwardly attracted. On the same day he begins hearing the voice of a woman that is omnisciently narrating the events in his life but he is unable to communicate with the voice. On his way home Harold's watch stops working and he resets it using the time given by a bystander; the voice narrates ""little did he know that this simple seemingly innocuous act would result in his imminent death"". Worried over this prediction Harold turns to a psychiatrist who attributes the voice to schizophrenia. Harold listens to her conclusion without giving importance to it. When he asks what she would advise if it were not schizophrenia the psychiatrist suggests Harold turn to a literary expert. Harold visits Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman) a university professor and relates his story. Jules first comes to the same conclusion as the psychiatrist as Harold's dull life is not something commonly seen in novels. However Jules then recognizes aspects of a literary work in Harold's story (""little did he know"") and encourages him to help identify the author first by determining if the work is a comedy or a tragedy.As Harold proceeds to audit Ana the two begin to fall for each other but when Harold refuses to accept cookies that Ana made for him on the grounds that they could be viewed as a bribe Ana angrily tells him to leave making Harold believe the story is a tragedy. Harold spends the next day at home to try to control his own destiny but his apartment is partially demolished by a wrecking crew mistaking the building for an abandoned one. Harold reveals these facts to Jules who believes that Harold cannot control the plot that has been set for him and should accept that he will die telling Harold to enjoy whatever time he has left to the fullest. Harold takes this to heart; he takes an extended vacation from work develops his friendship with his co-worker Dave (Tony Hale) fulfills his life dream of learning to play the guitar and starts to see Ana on a regular basis helping her to avoid tax issues by claiming charitable offerings. Harold believes he may have mistaken his story and now reassesses it as a comedy. When he returns to Jules with this revelation Harold inadvertently identifies the voice in his head from a television interview as noted author Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson). Jules a long-time fan of Karen's works reveals that in every book she has written the main character has died.Harold is able to find Karen through tax records and learns that she is presently struggling from writer's block in how to kill off the character of Harold Crick in her latest book Death and Taxes envisioning numerous ways to have Harold die while her publisher has sent an assistant Penny (Queen Latifah) to make sure the book gets completed. When Karen learns that Harold is a real person and has experienced everything she's written she becomes horrified to consider that all of her previous books may have also resulted in the deaths of real people. She tells Harold she has finally written a draft of the ending and his death but hasn't typed it up yet. Penny suggests Harold read the book and the drafted ending to get his opinion. Harold is unable to bring himself to read it and gives the manuscript to Jules to review. Jules reads it and tells Harold that the manuscript is a masterpiece his written death integral to its genius.Though Harold is deeply distressed over his fate Jules comforts him by stating the inevitability of death - this death at least will hold a deeper meaning by completing the book. Harold reads the manuscript himself and comes to the same conclusion and returns the manuscript to Karen accepting his death. He spends one last night with Ana.The next day Harold prepares to return to work after his vacation despite Karen's voice narrating the fateful day as she types up her planned ending. Due to getting the time from the stranger earlier Harold's watch is three minutes ahead and he arrives at the bus stop early enough to save a child on a bicycle from being run over by a bus though he himself is hit by the bus. Karen attempts to write Harold's death but is unable to do so and instead claims the watch was the character that died and that fragments of the watch helped to block the right ulnar artery in Harold's body after the collision preventing him from bleeding to death.Harold wakes up to find himself in a hospital alive though in traction and with several broken bones with Ana by his side to help him recover. When Jules reads Karen's final manuscript he notes that the story is weaker without Harold's death. Karen admits the flaw although she points out that the story was meant to be about a man that unknowingly dies and this was not the case.Therefore she states that she would rather have the story end with Harold alive changing the dead character to that of the watch which had earlier been personified throughout the film."
An I.R.S. auditor suddenly finds himself the subject of narration only he can hear: narration that begins to affect his entire life from his work to his love-interest to his death.
Everybody knows that your life is a story. But what if a story was your life? Harold Crick is your average IRS agent: monotonous boring and repetitive. But one day this all changes when Harold begins to hear an author inside his head narrating his life. The narrator it is extraordinarily accurate and Harold recognizes the voice as an esteemed author he saw on TV. But when the narration reveals that he is going to die Harold must find the author of the story and ultimately his life to convince her to change the ending of the story before it is too late.::the lexster
For twelve years the methodical IRS agent Harold Crick has had a routine lonely life guided by his wristwatch. However one day he hears the narration of his life in off telling that he is going to die pretty soon. Meanwhile he audits Ana Pascal the owner of a bakery that is in debt with the IRS and falls in love for her. Harold is advised by Professor Jules Hilbert to change his monotonous lifestyle while he tries to find Karen Eiffel the author of the story of his life who is researching means of killing the character and convince her to change the ending of the story.::Claudio Carvalho Rio de Janeiro Brazil
"Harold Crick an IRS agent leads a highly regimented routinized and solitary life having few friends besides his co-worker Dave. Suffering from OCD he has a habit of counting things like the number of times he brushes each tooth and the number of steps it takes to get to the bus stop for his daily commute. Because of these issues he is highly dependent upon his watch to which he refers often but which he otherwise does not consciously consider. Despite his nature he hates his job. One day while he is brushing his teeth he hears the bodiless voice of a British woman eloquently narrating what seems to be his story as he is acting it out. The story not only includes his actions but what his innermost thoughts and feelings are at the time. The voice comes and goes over time Harold not knowing the full story based on the missing parts. Not knowing what to do he brushes the voice aside until the voice says ""little did he know... would result in his imminent death"". Knowing that he is not schizophrenic which is the medical diagnosis Harold turns to literature professor Jules Hilbert who becomes Harold's sole confidante in the matter. Hilbert agrees to help him through the literary side of the matter solely because the voice used the literary convention of ""little did he know"". Trying to go against the normal in his life partly based on Hilbert's advice Harold begins to court Ana Pascal a baker who he is auditing who detests the very thought of him but about who he nonetheless cannot stop thinking. In reality the voice in question belongs to famed novelist chain smoking and nervous Karen Eiffel who is under great pressure from her publisher as she has not written anything in ten years due to writer's block. Her books always end with the lead character dying. Harold's story is slowly coming together but she has not yet worked out how he will die. Harold's fate seems to be in Karen's typing hands as his story plays out exactly when she types it out. The primary questions then become if Hilbert and Harold can find out that it is Karen writing the story if so if Harold can locate her if so if Karen will believe his story and if so if she will change her artistic vision to save Harold's life... or conversely if the fate between Karen's typewriter and Harold's life can somehow otherwise be broken.::Huggo"

A satirical view at a Muslim community living in Mercy Saskatchewan Canada.::IMDb editor
The location is Mercy Saskatchewan a small town in the Canadian prairies. A small but devout community of Muslims has settled there headed by community leader Yasir Hamoudi a local building contractor. He is married to Sarah a Caucasian ex-Christian who has converted to Islam for her husband. Their adult daughter Rayyan is a feminist Muslim doctor. The religious leader of the Muslim community - the Imam - is Amaar Rashid a young Canadian-born ex-lawyer from Toronto who came to Mercy to replace Baber Siddiqui who was deemed too extreme by many in the Mercy Muslim community. The local diner is run by Fatima Dinssa a Nigerian Muslim who is strict about her religion but more liberal in her cultural values. The Muslims in Mercy are co-existing with their Christian neighbors sometimes harmoniously sometimes not. Reverend Duncan Magee welcomes his Muslim neighbors especially if they enhance the social and economic fabric of the community and his parish. Likewise Mayor Ann Popowicz welcomes the Muslim population especially if they vote for her. However local radio host Fred Tupper is suspect of the Muslims and their supposed terrorist ways. But he and many of the townsfolk Muslim or Christian are equally as suspect of someone like Amaar since he is from the big bad city of Toronto a city which has shaped his views and which is contrary to the outlook of a town like Mercy.::Huggo

Kingman now entrusts PR wizard Lee Philips whom he just had fired to organize a press junket that none of the journalists will ever forget - just to distract the press from the fact that the film itself won't be shown at all. Therefore Lee somehow has to bring Gwen and Eddie back together at least for that one weekend in a lonely hotel resort in the Nevada desert. Not quite everything works out the way Lee wanted it to since Gwen's sister and assistant Kiki also has a mind of her own.::Julian Reischl <julianreischl@mac.com>"
After they've broken up a married movie star couple still has to go out and promote the movie they made together while they were in love even though they now hate each other. To keep the junket from falling apart when the print of their film doesn't show up the film's publicist tries to divert attention by concocting the story of the couple's reunion that everything's still hunky-dory between them... when in fact the actor is actually in love with his wife's formerly fat assistant and the actress has found a new beau named Hector.::<Laffz00@aol.com>
Gwen and Eddie were at one time Hollywood's premier couple on and off the screen. But during the filming of their latest movie Gwen took up with a Latin guy she met on the set. She and Eddie have since split up. Now their movie is ready to be shown but the director will only first show it at the press junket. But the studio boss concerned of what the movie will be instructs Lee his P.R. man to handle to junket and to try and distract the press from asking about the movie by making them think that Gwen and Eddie are back together. Only problem is that he just fired Lee but after giving in to Lee's demands he agrees. Lee enlists the aid of Gwen's assistant Kiki who is her sister to help. When they get to the junket things are still tense between them. And Kiki is trying hard to keep in check her feelings for Eddie.::rcs0411@yahoo.com

Just released from a jail term of 2 1/2 years in Berlin Bruno Stroszek goes through all of the formalities of being released and is given back all of his personal belongings: one sweater one shirt a pair of pants a pair of socks an accordion five packs of cigarettes a bugle horn a keychain and his passport. Back in his cell he bids farewell to his cellmates and they exchange gifts. One makes for him the smallest paper ship in the world and the other sets his flatulence ablaze. He then meets with the warden who asks him if he has a place to live now that he is free to which Bruno replies that his apartment had been taken care of by his neighbour Herr Scheitz. He is then asked whether or not he'll go back to consuming alcohol since all of his past offences had been alcohol-related and that if he were to be caught again for similar crimes that he'd be locked away for a longer period of time. Bruno seems uninterested and is then recommended that he clean himself up and once again to stay away from bars and alcohol. He finally promises and is subsequently released.During his walk home he stops at a bar called 'Bier Himmel' (Beer Heaven) and orders a beer. As he walks to sit at a booth he sees his friend Eva a prostitute. He attempts greeting her but is told to leave her alone by her pimps who were there trying to extort money from a former client of Eva's. She then starts crying on one of the pimps telling him she doesn't want to be with any other pimp. He stands up and slaps her across the face to which Eva starts crying and walks away towards where Bruno is sitting. He tells her to sit with him and tries to reassure her that everything will be OK. Eva asks him where he had been to which Bruno responded: 'vacation'. She is still distraught and asks herself 'what she's going to do' and 'where she's going to go' to which Bruno responds by telling her she can stay at his apartment and that they can both start new lives together.As she sets up her belongings Bruno is playing his pianos to see if they are still in good condition after not being played for so long. His favorite piano is a black grand piano he calls 'Schwarze Freund' (black friend). They notice how the apartment is dirty and Eva says she'd take care of everything by earning money. Bruno's neighbour Herr Scheitz arrives with his minah bird he had been taking care of in his absence. He then tells Bruno and Eva of his plans to move to America and stay with his nephew - but by ship since according to Scheitz airplanes are not built correctly. In the next scene Bruno goes back to his ritualistic ways of playing his accordion in an alleyway to an audience of mostly children. When he arrives at his apartment he sees Eva's pimps waiting for him outside his door and leaves running the opposite way. He finds Eva at a restaurant with her pimps and is quickly kicked out. He retreats back to his apartment and talks to Scheitz about what is happening with Eva when at that moment the pimps are dragging her up the stairs and into the living room dump trash on her and break one of Bruno's accordions. Bruno helps her get up and into bed.The next day Bruno is out buying some fruits and sees that the pimps are watching him from whom he instantly runs away. While playing his piano at home the pimps walk in and start harassing him. Now himself being distraught from the constant trouble the pimps are making he sees his doctor and asks him for advice since he can't defend himself. The doctor tells him he should start off by getting a steady job and then takes him to the premature baby ward in order to further explain the concept of life and its many unanswered questions. He used a premature baby to symbolize how he could barely survive on his own but had such strong grip reflexes although considered weak.Back at the apartment Scheitz is waiting for him to arrive and shows him what the pimps had done to Eva which was to once again physically abuse her. Bruno asks her if she wants him to call the police to report it only to be told no and how they need to escape the whole mess. They decide to go with Scheitz to America and finance the tickets/Visas by Eva earning more money by selling her body a few more times. Scheitz reports back to them and informs Bruno that he can work as a mechanic at his nephew's auto shop and that Eva can work at a nearby restaurant at a truck stop.They arrive in America and Bruno's bird Beo gets confiscated by customs to which he asks Eva and Scheitz: What kind of country is this that they take away my Beo? After a little sightseeing in New York they purchase a used car and drive out to Railroad Flats Wisconsin. When they arrive Scheitz's nephew Clayton greets them with a misspelled sign in German saying: Welcome. Meet & Greet time is followed by picture-taking and they learn how Clayton was once stationed at the US Air Force base in Ramstein. They get a short tour of the town by Clayton and are then told by him about the mysterious disappearance of a farmer who drove out into the woods on his large tractor never to be found again. He claims the wreckage is probably underwater in one of the nearby lakes and periodically searches for it with a metal detector when they're frozen over.Once settled in they learn about the situation between two farmers nearby that patrol a stretch of land labeled: no-mans land and are told to stay away since both carry rifles and could potentially start firing at each other at any moment. The pre-fabricated house they had ordered arrives and is fully furnished. Scheitz is then seen outside performing electro-magnetic experiments on a fence and then on 2 American hunters on the side of the road- in German- to which of course they don't understand. He then tells Bruno and Eva about his animal magnetism theory and performs his testing on their skin. In the next scene they are all seen on and around a frozen lake with a metal detector in their search for the lost tractor.Realizing that theyre falling behind on paying all of their bills Bruno and Eva discuss this to which Eva tells Bruno not to worry because she could take care of everything. She accomplishes this by sleeping with truckers that stop by her work. Soon after theyre visited by a bank representative who informs them of their lack of payments and the possibility of repossessions if they continue to not pay. Eva hands him a wad of cash and is asked by Bruno how she had made so much money in that little time. In the next scene Bruno shows Eva a model/schematic of his state of mind (which appears to be wood or metal that is intertwined). He tells her how their goals in the US cant be reached because he saw America as an opportunity to get rich quick. He also points out that shes acting differently around him primarily by not letting him sleep in the same bedroom it feels like prison he says like a cage. At work Clayton is making sexually suggestive comments about Eva and Bruno says he was better off in Germany and that he shouldn't have come to America to watch his world fall apart.The next day Eva is with some truckers once again as Bruno looks for her at the restaurant. Not being able to find her there he then tries searching around where the trucks are parked. He finds Eva in a truck with 2 truckers and is told to leave because she was going to Vancouver with them. Drinking his sorrows away at home Bruno is once again visited by the bank representative and is told that the bank has to repossess everything and signs the house away. Soon after the bank rep and an auctioneer arrive at the house and auction it off. Scheitz claims it is all a conspiracy and goes to the bank the next day with Bruno and a shotgun. Because the bank was closed they enter a door next to it which happened to be for a barber. They take all of his money twenty-five dollars and walk across the street to a market to buy food. Once inside the police arrive and arrest Scheitz leaving Bruno and a frozen turkey he had just bought. He then drives back to Claytons house and leaves with his tow-truck the frozen turkey some cans of beer and the shotgun.He drives until an engine fire starts in the truck at a diner. Once there he stops to get a coffee with his last $3 and tells an American businessman who can speak some German all about his troubles and is told by him not to worry. When he leaves he puts the truck in drive and leaves it driving itself in circles outside of the restaurant and takes his gun and frozen turkey across the street to what seems to be some sort of mini animal amusement park. Inside are coin-operated machines which feature animals performing different things like one chicken dancing one playing a piano and a rabbit fire truck rider. Bruno starts some of them with the last of his change and then goes to the back of the facility which has a chairlift. He turns it on and rides up the side of the mountain. At the second ascent the frame of the camera shifts up not being able to see Bruno any longer. At that moment a loud noise is heard which is unclear where it comes from.Its been said that the noise is either from the sound of his shotgun from his suicide or the tow-trucks engine exploding. At the end of the movie police are on the street and are reporting back to their headquarters stating: We've got a truck on fire can't find the switch to turn the ski lift off and can't stop the dancing chicken. Send an electrician.

"Igncio (Jack Black) is a young orphan boy dreaming of becoming the world's greatest luchador (Spanish wrestler) and decides to test his fighting skills in a monastary graveyard. He is discovered by monks and is taken to be cleansed and made into the orphanage chef. This does not bode well for young Igncio but he does his duty and continues to do so even after fifteen years although not entirely successfully..As an adult Igncio still dreams of becoming the ultimate luchador but has been taught that wrestling is a sin. To make matters worse he meets his soul mate a nun Sister Encarnacin (Ana de la Reguera) who has been hired as the orphans' teacher. He is smitten with her but knows the relationship will never work for they both have take an oath of celibacy.
Nevertheless he goes to speak with her and invites her to have toast with him in
his quarters but is interrupted by the lead monk (Eduardo Gmez) who tells him to visit a man sick with influenza. Igncio reluctantly obeys.Upon arriving at the man's house Igncio meets the man's wife but sees that the man is apparently dead. He begins to give a eulogy but as he does so the man awakes from a deep sleep. This terrifies Igncio and he leaves to take care of other duties. As he travels through the village on his trademark chariot (a motorized chariot-like shopping cart) he stops at a local eatery to pick up the free chips that the restaurant's owner leaves each day for the orphans. He is unexpectedly attacked by an extremely skinny street urchin (Hector Jimnez) who steals the chips and leaves Igncio bruised and disgraced.That night on the way back to the orphanage Igncio witnesses a luchador the great Ramses (Cesar Gonzalez) being adored and worshipped by his many fans. Igncio finds out that a tag-team tournament will be offered to new luchadors and this grabs the attention of our dismayed hero.Igncio and Encarnacion later enjoy toast in Igncio's quarters and he sheds some light on his past. He then goes on to tell Encarnacion of his feelings about the monastary and tells her of the luchador he encountered in the village. She tells him that luchadors are false idols and to be patient for his passion to fight should soon pass away.The next day the monks complain about the missing chips. Igncio tries to explain the situation but his efforts fall on deaf ears. Angered Igncio leaves the monastary and heads to the village with a handful of leftover chips. He throws them into the alleyway where he was previously attacked. He waits behind a wall for the homeless assailant to pounce. He almost succeeds in sneaking up on him but gives himself away when he breaks wind. He tackles the man and they begin to fight. During the fight Igncio asks the man if he would join him in the tournament. At first Steven the homeless man ignores the proposition but after hearing that there is a grand prize of two hundred pesos he decides to team up with Igncio. They make two makeshift luchador uniforms out of stolen items train themselves with unusual methods and then enter into the tournament.Igncio and Steven now go by the names Nacho and Esqueleto (Nacho is a nickname for Igncio; Esqueleto means ""skeleton"" in Spanish which suits malnourished Steven perfectly)
and face their first two opponents El Semental (Igncio Camarena) and El Pony (Carlos Barroso). Esqueleto is struck down by El Semental but Nacho gives El Pony a run for his money.
At one point it seems that Nacho and Esqueleto are nearing victory until Nacho is knocked unconcious by El Semental.Although they failed to win the tournament Nacho and Esqueleto are given a well-portioned
consolation prize. Nacho spends his part of the winnings on better food for the orphans' meals and begins to draw out plans for a new uniform a baby-blue and red one. Luckily Steven has a knowledge of sewing and helps Igncio create their new outfits. Chancho (Darius Rose) an orphan child catches Nacho trying on his outfit in the monastary but promises to never tell a soul.As Nacho and Esqueleto prepare for their next fight Nacho hassles Esqueleto about his beliefs
in science and not in the Lord. He unofficially baptizes him and then they head on to the fight.
This time they are pitted against two midget wrestlers known as Satan's Cavemen (Agustin Rey
and Ricardo Castillo). Although they are small they prove worthy adversaries for our heroes
and after a struggle they defeat Nacho and Esqueleto. Once again however the duo are paid a hefty consolation prize.This time they spend their cash polishing up their physical appearances. Igncio buys new clothes and boots and Steven gets a pedicure and a charicature. Igncio tells Steven about his feelings for Encarnacion and Steven concocts a plan. He proposes that Nacho should take Encarnacion on a date and that he would show up with some of his hobo buddies to beat Nacho up but that they would let him win. Igncio likes the sound of this idea.That night Igncio takes Encarnacion out by telling her that he wants both of them to minister
to a bum he claims he saw previously. Once they get there Nacho says a few cheesy lines
but then notices two gentlemen walking down the street. Thinking that they are Steven's friends he challenges them to a fight. They ignore him but he runs up to the two men and
rips one of the mens' jackets. They turn and face Igncio but he is already in his fighting position. However he hears Steven's voice far off and sees him with his real hobo friends.
This distracts Nacho giving the two men enough time to sucker-punch Igncio knocking him
unconscious.The next day Nacho is humiliated and expresses his anger at Steven for being late. Steven feels
bad for Igncio and tells him about a secret water gypsy who uses magical eagle eggs to grant
peoples' desires. Nacho sees this as an opportunity to gain power as a luchador and the two
embark on a journey to see the gypsy. When they arrive they sail over to a cliff in the water where
an eagle's nest is precariously perched. The gypsy tells Nacho to climb the cliff and to eat one of the eggs and that this will give him the strength he needs. Igncio makes the strenuous and difficult climb to the cliff's peak and cracks open an egg and swallows the yolk inside. He then dives off the cliff into the sea below.Contrary to the gypsy's promises Nacho and Esqueleto's next fights against the luchadors Paradise (Albert Madrid) Sage (Lauro Chartrand) and many others prove disastrous. Nacho feels that he was lied to and tells Esqueleto that they need to go pro if they wish to advance in their wrestling careers. He makes a plan to go to a party being thrown by Senor Ramon (Enrique Munoz) the best manager in wrestling.The next day Igncio takes the orphans on a field trip to see the village. He humorously gives insight into the town's various locales and then he and the orphans see Ramses and other luchadors leaving the gym. The orphans ask Nacho to get Ramses's autograph but after trying to persuade the wrestler for his signature Ramses gets annoyed and shoves Nacho into a melon cart. Nacho then gives up trying.That night after Steven once again sews new outfits for himself and Igncio to wear to the party Igncio tells Encarnacion not to worry about getting the orphans food but that he would do this himself. Nacho and Esqueleto then head to the party. After failing to get past the party's bouncers Igncio boosts Steven over a wall so that he can get in. Although Steven cannot lift Nacho he is able to sneak in by pretending to be a member of the hired mariachi band. Steven strikes up a conversation with Senor Ramon who who tells him about an upcoming tournament known as the Battle Jam. The winnner of this competition receives eight hundred pesos and is given a chance to fight against the current champion Ramses. Steven accidentally attracts the attention of Ramon's plus-sized daughter Candidia (Carla Jimenez) and she is instantly love-struck.Meanwhile Igncio tries his best to pretend to play the bass guitar with the band. Steven goes upstairs to relax and finds Candidia's extensive doll collection. He accidentally breaks one of the dolls but is surprised to find Candidia sitting right next to him in the room. She instantly forgives him. Naturally Steven asks how she got upstairs so fast. Her reply is that she installed secret tunnels throughout the house. Obviously freaked out Esqueleto makes a mad dash to leave but Candidia travels down her secret tunnel.At the same time Igncio is asked to sing a song so he makes one up right on the spot. However his composition doesn't go over well and Ramses shows his disapproval by pouring out his wine on Nacho's shirt. Screams can be heard over the crowd though and Nacho goes over to see what the matter is. He finds that Candidia is trying to pull Steven into her secret tunnel and tries to help by slamming her with his bass. He misses and accidentally hits Steven. The two are then kicked out of the party.As they travel back to the chariot they see two rival luchadors whom Nacho and Esqueleto almost beat slashing their tires. They engage them but keep their disatance because their foes have knives. Steven uses an ear of corn he had been munching on as a projectile and lands it in his foe's eye socket. The duo push the cart back to the orphanage and then Nacho remembers that he forgot to the get the groceries. It's too late to go back however because it is now approaching daybreak so he takes his anger out on Steven. He blames him for his shortcomings and Esqueleto replies by saying that he hates all the orphans in the world.Later that day Igncio attends mass and prays for forgivness and that God would bless him in battle so that he could win money for the orpans. He goes to light a candle at the altar but accidentally sets his robes on fire. The congregation sees the luchador outfit Nacho was wearing underneath his robes and soon realizes what he has been doing. Nacho tells the monks
and Encarnacion about his plan to win the Battle Jam and give his winnings to the orphans for all of their needs. He leaves the orphanage to go to the Battle Jam where he must fight several fighters all at once. The fighters include Silencio (Donald Chambers) El Snowflake (Craig Williams) Dynasty (Brett Chan) El Chino (Mike Ching) Muneco (Abelardo Hernandez) Carlos Rosales (Emiliano Quiroga) and his trusty companion Esqueleto. Dynasty El Snowflake Muneco and Carlos Rosales are defeated in the beginning and Silencio takes out El Chino and Esqueleto at the same time.Nacho approaches Silencio but for some odd reason Muneco trips Nacho from outside of the ring causing Nacho to fall in front of Silencio. Silencio picks Nacho up and then drops him once again knocking our hero unconcious also once again leaving him defeated. Nacho sullenly returns to the orphanage and decides to give up wrestling and spend the rest of his days in the wilderness. Chancho gives Nacho his lucky machete (his mother gave it to him before she died) and then Nacho heads into the wilderness.Ignacio creates a makeshift shelter and lives off of cactus water. The next day however Steven drives into the wilderness on the chariot and tries to persuade Nacho to come back to wrestling. As it turns out it was easy for him to find Nacho because although he thought he was in the wilderness Nacho was really right next to a small village. Esqueleto tells him that Silencio cannot fight Ramses because he got injured (which is humorously shown in a clip where Esqueleto runs over Silencio's foot with the chariot after Silencio was mean to a poor orphan child) and that Nacho gets to fight Ramses because he came in second place. Nacho is reluctant at first but agrees to fight him.Igncio writes a letter to Encarnacion which Steven delivers which tells her of his love for her and of the fight he will be in against Ramses. While in the locker room Nacho sings a very comical song to Esqueleto which he wrote for Encarnacion but he is interrupted by an arena worker who tells him that the fight will now begin. Nacho goes into the ring and the battle against Ramses commences.Although there are many close calls Nacho makes it to the second round. Ramses ignores the bell and begins an all-out street fight against Nacho. Ramses seems to have Nacho pinned until Encarnacion enters the arena with the orphans. The sight of his lover gives Nacho the strength to fight back and he eventually flings Ramses out of the ring. Nacho then climbs up one of the corner pillars of the ring and dive-bombs towards Ramses. It is here that the eagle powers finally kick in and give Nacho the needed air time to reach Ramses and put him into an unbreakable submission. Against all odds Nacho comes out victorious and is declared the luchador champion.A week later Nacho takes Encarnacion Steven and the orphans on a field trip to see the Mayan pyramids of Chichen Itza in a newly-purchased bus and closes out this movie with a somewhat disturbing smile.

Three separate but intertwined stories of passengers aboard a crowded Innsbruck to Rome train are presented. In the first story an aging Italian professor of pharmacology on business in Austria has to at the last minute take the train home to Rome rather than fly as was his original plan. Although he has always considered himself a bit of a dreamer he is dreaming more on this train trip than usual most specifically romantic thoughts about the young executive assistant with the pharmaceutical company that rearranged his travel she who he had not even met before she doing this task for him one hour prior to departure. His dreams are more powerful but knowingly less attainable as he gets older. Certain aspects of the trip at times bring him back to reality including being seated across from a soldier and noticing who seem to be a poor family huddled outside the dining room car where his seat has been reserved for the duration of the trip. In the second story an unabashedly loud Italian woman on the far side of middle age is traveling with a young unrelated man twenty-five year old Filippo who seems to be at her beck and call. She feels entitled as witnessed by sitting in reserved seats in first class on their second class tickets and is belligerent against anyone questioning her about anything to which she feels entitled which is more often than not. She does not like it when Filippo's attention strays anywhere away from her. Some aboard the train eventually learn the nature of their relationship. Despite his obligation to her he begins to question his current lot in life and missed opportunities when he runs into some girls who knew him from his home town of Bracciano. And in the third story three working class Scottish lads - Jamesy Frank and Spaceman - are going to Rome to watch a Champions League Celtic vs. Roma football match. They have planned this trip for months although they can barely afford it as witnessed by they bringing food from the supermarket at which they work as their meals and hoping to find free accommodation in Rome. In their exuberance they want to be everyone's friends. Things change when they get into a financial bind. Being three diverse personalities they have differing views of what to do about the situation Frank who may get his way solely by virtue of being the loudest.

Charles starts lighting on all the candles aglow while Peggy goes to the bathroom to put on some sexy lingerie. With the makeup and the atmosphere Charles finds her really attractive. So although he's really a gold digger and he doesn't like her at all -he shouts to her in exasperation several times- he finds her attractive at that moment and they have a night of passionate sex.

He sees Peggy -with different clothes makeup and hairstyle - passionate kissing another man Allen (Richard Eden) who is also strong and handsome like him.

Charles jumps to try to avoid the murder but he goes through the figures: he has been seeing the ghosts of these two people. Charles starts to thinks and he remembers that Peggy never met her father whose name was Allen. So Charles guesses that he's just seen how her mother killed her father on their wedding night. At that moment Peggy appears. She tells him that she's going to kill him so that their love won't get stained by routine arguments. She thinks that they've just had a perfect love night and doesn't want their marriage to grow with problems. To try to dissuade her he says that he never loved her but she tells him that they both felt love during the night as the night was so perfect during sex. Charles tries to shoot Peggy with the gun none of them knew anything about but there are no bullets inside. Peggy kills him bloodily and mercilessly. The aunt appears in the morning to pick Peggy up. They talk about the future babygirl who will do the same thing to some uncautious boy and Peggy promises her aunt not to ever think about boys again.

"Kirk Kettner (Jay Baruchel) is a native of Pittsburgh Pennsylvania in his mid-20s who has low self-esteem and by his own admission has not accomplished very much in life. He works at the Pittsburgh International Airport as a Transportation Security Administration officer and hopes of becoming a pilot one day. He tries to get back together with his self-centered ex-girlfriend Marnie (Lindsay Sloane). Marnie ended her relationship with Kirk two years ago and is highly dismissive of his continued romantic interests after his latest pursuit. However she has remained close with Kirk's parents (Debra Jo Rupp and Adam LeFevre) and overbearing brother Dylan (Kyle Bornheimer) continues to participate in family activities along with her new boyfriend Ron and even lives with Kirk's parents. He has three close male friends who also work at the airport: Stainer (T. J. Miller) Devon (Nate Torrence) and Jack (Mike Vogel).Then at work one morning a beautiful woman Molly McCleish (Alice Eve) arrives at the passenger terminal for a flight to New York. While proceeding through security her striking looks attract unwanted attention and harassment from several male employees. Kirk is the only employee to treat her courteously. She and Kirk exchange a few innocuous words and she then proceeds to her flight accidentally leaving her phone in the airport security area. Upon realizing she has misplaced it Molly calls her phone and Kirk back at the security checkpoint answers. The two arrange for a time to meet the following evening so that he may return the phone to her.The following night Kirk arrives at the Andy Warhol Museum where Molly a professional event planner is running a party. Devon accompanies Kirk to the Museum where Kirk returns Molly her phone. After returning the phone both stayed and met Katie Molly's sister. Katie then on purpose causes Kirk to spill his drink on the museum director and is asked to leave the museum for being uninvited for the party. Molly offers tickets to Kirk to the Pittsburgh Penguins hockey game at the Mellon Arena as an apology. Molly then subsequently gets herself invited to Kirk's family lunch. This incurs jealousy in Marnie who feels upstaged by Molly's looks and takes a sudden interest in Kirk again. Stainer ranking-obsessed tells Kirk that on a scale from 1 to 10 with 10 meaning the most attractive and successful he's a 5 and Molly a 10 and that a relationship does not work if the difference is more than 2. Molly's friend and business partner Patty (Krysten Ritter) is also surprised: she phoned Molly while on a date with Kirk to allow her an opportunity to make up an excuse to leave but that was not needed.In Molly's house while the two are making out Kirk ejaculates in his pants just before her parents arrive. While avoiding to show that he had ejaculated he avoids standing up and quickly leaves to avoid Molly and her parents noticing what happened. This cools down the relationship but when Kirk later explains during an airshow what happened things are fine again. Molly's former boyfriend Cam tells Kirk that Molly has a defect and to avoid saying that she is perfect.During a date Kirk suggests to Molly to throw a birthday party for her sister Katie. After the party both of them go to Molly's place. Molly shows Kirk her webbed toes which Kirk considers so minor that he decides that she is too perfect for him and he breaks off the relationship. Kirk and Marnie resume their relationship and go on a family trip to Branson.Stainer and Patty realize their mistake in telling Kirk and Molly it wouldn't work out; the friends convince Kirk that he is ""a 10"" too. They pull Kirk off his plane as he tries to leave with his family and Marnie while Patty brings Molly to the airport. Kirk rejects Marnie and reunites with Molly. Later as a surprise he takes Molly on a trip in a small plane with himself being the pilot; he has taken flying lessons."

Mr Karva runs a shady little empire in North London. We don't know exactly how he makes his money but we know it's probably not very nice. Mr Karva's stepson Othello has ambitions to take the old man's place; and Othello's fainthearted friend Emilio has ambitions of his own. This delicate balance of power is upset when Roadrunner finds a strange sickly-looking 10 year old boy in the park. All his life Roadrunner has been on the move - but when he looks into the child's eyes he finds he can finally stop running. It becomes clear that the child can grant each character their own taste of heaven - the 'perfect rosy future of your dreams'. The child never talks but transforms the world around him working on the desire in each character's heart whatever it may be. Othello wins every bet he makes; Christella finds a new son to replace the baby she lost; Mr. Karva achieves his elusive orgasm and Father Daniel is finally able to express his own secret passions.

"The film's plot is often compared to Pier Paolo Pasolini's Teorema in which a strange visitor to a wealthy family seduces the maid the son the mother the daughter and finally the father before leaving a few days after subsequently changing their lives.The film starts off with a question: ""Have you ever done it with your Dad?""; the viewer then sees Miki Yamazaki a young prostitute trying to persuade her father Kiyoshi into having sex with her. Her father is videotaping the scene for a documentary he is preparing on Japanese youths. Once it appears the father is letting himself be persuaded she tells him the price (50000 Yen). They have sex the father ejaculates after a very short time and the disappointed daughter informs him it will be 100000 Yen now because of this. The father then realises the camera has been on all along.In the next scene called ""Have you ever been hit on the head?"" a man (the visitor) hits the father over the head with a rock for no apparent reason.The film then moves on to a scene titled ""Have you ever hit your mom?"" In this scene the mother is working on a jigsaw puzzle and her hands are shown to have red marks showing where she was beaten. Her young son Takuya comes in and starts throwing things at the already broken apartment walls because he is unhappy with the toothbrush his mother bought him. He then hits his mother with a rug beating stick. Later bullies from the son's school come to the front of the house and shoot fireworks through the son's bedroom window. The mother is later seen injecting heroin. It does not seem to have a huge effect on her though suggesting she is a regular user.On his way back from work the father is yet again hit on the head by the same man. They both arrive at the father's home and the mother serves them dinner. The son comes down while they are eating and starts beating the mother again. This does not surprise or bother the father or the visitor. Later the father is seen watching one of his old tapes and it turns out that he was raped by a group of teenagers.The next day the father is on his way to work when he sees his son being beaten and robbed by some children from school. He films it from a distance and appears very pleased with the footage.The mother meanwhile is getting ready for work. The viewer discovers her body is covered in marks from where the son has hurt her. She also has a limp.The father meets with a female co-worker who believes he is going too far in his work. The mother working as a prostitute is whipping a customer with a belt (at his request). She then goes to buy some drugs.When she gets home she discovers the pieces from her jigsaw have been arranged so as to form a trail through the house and ending at a photograph of her daughter. The visitor is at home and he introduces her to lactation sex (squeezing her nipples to make her lactate a recurring theme in this film). The son sees this while hiding behind the door.At dinner the mother is much happier than usual and has prepared a nice meal. The son however is sullen and throws a bowl of hot soup at her face. The wifeinstead of being downtrodden as usualcomes back with a carving knife and throws it at the head of her son who dodges just in time. Everyone is very pleased except the son. However the father becomes exhilarated when the schoolchildren start attacking his house with fireworks again which he videotapes. Meanwhile the mother and the visitor continue to eat peacefully.Next day the son is bullied again. The father is taping his son from his car with the visitor and his female co-worker. The co-worker gets fed up with the father and tries to leave. The father follows her on foot and sexually assaults her while the visitor emotionally neutral tapes the scene. The father unintentionally chokes his victim to death.He takes her body back home and puts her in the greenhouse. The visitor is still taping at the father's instruction. The father sends the visitor to get garbage bags from the mother. But when the visitor asks her for them she takes her clothes off and reveals she is dressed in a garbage bag. She then makes herself lactate and produces a rain of human milk that covers the floor while the visitor watches from underneath an umbrella.During this time the husband is drawing on the womans body to mark the best places to cut it up so the smaller pieces will fit in the bags. He tapes this for his documentary. Becoming aroused the father has sex with the dead body. He then notices she is getting wet and is amazed that this is possible for a dead woman. When he brings his hand up however it is covered in feces. He then discovers that his penis is stuck inside the corpse due to Rigor mortis. The mother comes out to help and rushes to the shop to buy lots of oils and vinegar. She empties the bottles into the bath with her husband and the corpse. This does not help though so she gives him a shot of heroin which frees him. They are both exhilarated.The visitor has filmed the whole scene.Later on the couple is having fun dismembering the female co-worker's corpse when the son turns up in the front yard with the same children beating him. The parents rush out and with great pleasure they finally kill all the bullies using the axes and knives they were using to cut the co-worker's body to pieces. Later their son is shown lying on the floor in the puddle of maternal milk. He thanks the visitor for the chaos he brought to their family which helped them become closer than ever.The visitor leaves the family. Afterwards finding the prostitute daughter on the street he hits her in the face with a rock. Beaten and bleeding she comes back home to the family and finds the father suckling on the mother's breast in the garden. The final shot of the movie is of the daughter suckling on her mother's other breast symbolising the return of family order. All scars on the mother have disappeared as have those on the daughter shown seconds before (caused by being hit with the rock) suggesting a symbolically healed family."

To deal with a back problem upscale New Yorker Alice Tate on the advice of several of her friends visits Dr. Yang an acupuncturist for therapy. Dr. Yang diagnoses Alice's physical problem as a manifestation of her emotional issues primarily her dissatisfaction with her fifteen year marriage to wealthy Doug Tate and her superficial and pampered life filled primarily with shopping spa treatments and face-lifts. Dr. Yang who is much more than an acupuncturist prescribes a course of herbal treatments to which Alice adheres strictly despite her skepticism. Each individual herbal treatment has a different fantastical effect on Alice which allows her at least to feel uninhibited enough to find out more about the man at her children's school to who she is attracted. She learns that he is divorced father Joe Ruffalo a musician. The treatments also allow her among other things to communicate with a deceased ex-boyfriend Ed to ask for his advice on her situation. Through her relationship with Dr. Yang Alice may come to some conclusions about what she wants to do with her entire life and not just those parts related to Doug or Joe and how best to move toward those end goals.::Huggo

The cast members have great fun parodying the on-air personas that MTV created for them through its editing: San Francisco's Rachel is now the ultimate self-centered bitch London's Lars has his nose stuck up so high he might die from asphyxiation and New York's Heather B. becomes a walking-talking hip-hop video. And in the ""true"" manner of such shows every backstab every catfight and every shocking revelation is caught on videotape for our tawdry entertainment. As the reality genre pushes the envelope - and strains credibility - it becomes ripe for parody; who better to do it than the people who created it in the first place?::Andrew Preis"

"""History teaches us that men behave wisely . . . once they've exhausted all other alternatives. For most rock bands the pursuit of wisdom's a low priority compared to fame fortune and fornication. Such a band was Strange Fruit."" Thus begins the opening dialog of Hughie (Billy Connolly) as he launches into a brief history of the British band: in the late 1970's Strange Fruit consisting of guitarist Brian Lovell (Bruce Robinson) his brother and lead singer Keith keyboard player Tony Costello (Stephen Rea) bassist Les Wickes (Jimmy Nail) and drummer Beano Baggot (Timothy Spall) were HUGE. When Keith died of a drug overdose he was replaced on vocals by Ray Simms (Bill Nighy). Watched over by road-dog Hughie and Girl Friday Karen (Juliet Aubrey) they soldiered on until the disastrous appearance at the open-air Wisbech (U.K.) Rock Festival when lightning struck the stage during their opening number. The already-contentious band members decided it was a sign and immediately broke up forever (all this in the first five minutes of the film).
Forever that is until in the present (OK 1998) Tony is spotted on Ibeza (he now stocks condoms in the restrooms at the resorts there) by the son of the Wisbech promoter who wants to put together a 20th anniversary reunion concert with all the original acts. Tony seeks out Karen now a divorced mother who coordinates conferences for a major hotel suggesting a possible reunion. She is ambivalent as is Les (now a successful roofer with a family) and Ray (a struggling solo artist with a demanding second wife -- Swedish -- and a mansion he can't afford). Beano working in a floral nursery and hounded by the Inland Revenue (the U.K.'s IRS) is the only immediately enthusiastic bandmate.
They arrange a meeting where Karen informs them that she's tracked Brian and found his music royalties are being distributed per a bequest in his will provoking Beano to compassionately ask if that means ""the silly sod's dead?""
The band again soldiers on. Hughie shows up to complete what's left of the original entourage and the band begins to practice. It becomes obvious that beyond the normal clash of rock and roll egos the biggest problem is Les's extreme resentment of Ray who not only replaced one-half of a near-genius song-writing duo (the Lovell brothers) but who also refused to let Les sing even though Les considers himself a better singer than Ray (especially when it comes to a certain ballad called ""The Flame Still Burns"" heard briefly and only acoustically during the middle parts of the film).
Karen now the band's manager recruits a young guitarist named Luke (Hans Matheson) to replace Brian and besides she tells the mid-lifers ""he makes you look younger."" She also tries to secure a record deal citing the popularity of the nostalgia wave. She doesn't get it but she does get financing for a continental European tour to see what they've got.
The band and entourage along with Karen's daughter Clare (Rachael Stirling) ostensibly there to do the washing etc. but really there so Karen can keep an eye on her head across the channel and have some disastrous first concerts while slowly getting their groove back. Many humorous situations unfold during this tour as when (for just one example) Ray in a Dutch village attends what he thinks is an AA meeting only to find that it's an Overeaters Anonymous gathering.
The band slowly get better and better and even score a record deal before a confrontation between band members and their egos blows it all up.
All seems lost until just by luck (and a visit to a graveyard) Karen finds out that Brian Lovell isn't dead after all but a voluntary patient at a mental health facility. She and Tony visit him and convince him to join the band. This is hard on Tony because he's always had a thing for Karen who's always had a thing for Brian.
The band is reunited and ready to play the Wisbech reunion until the press badger Brian about his former drug use and present mental fragility. He bails and the band is set to go on without him. As they take the stage to perform the same song that they were to sing at the original Wisbech a microphone feedback reminds Ray of the lightning strike and he freezes. To save the situation Tony begins to play ""The Flame Still Burns"". Ray relinquishes the vocals to a stunned Les. Suddenly Brian shows up in time to take the guitar solo and the movie ends with the final strains of this song with all of them singing. As the end titles begin to scroll Hughie asks ""and how will the Fruits conspire to bollocks things up this time around? We wait with bated breath!"""
"""Strange Fruit"" had everything that makes a legendary rockband: Money Fame Success Groupies a Singer who died of drugs and even a divine ending when lightning struck the stage during an open-air. Twenty years later all band members are minding their own businesses the idea of a band reunion is brought up by well public request. Tony the former keyboard player sets out only to find his former friends working as a roofer a gardener and a hotel clerk. They all became rather everyday people married or still single they definitely are not wild and crazy anymore. But with the help of former manager Karen who is still dreaming of Brian the apparently deceased lead guitarist they all old fat and wrinkled as they are try to catch that spirit again.::chijim222@yahoo.com"
In the seventies Strange Fruit were it. They lived the rock lifestyle to the max groupies drugs internal tension and an ex front man dead from an overdose. Even their demise was glamorous; when lightning struck the stage during an outdoor festival. 20 years on and these former rock gods they have now sunk deep into obscurity when the idea of a reunion tour is lodged in the head of Tony former keyboard player of the Fruits. Tony sets out to find his former bandmates with the help of former manager Karen to see if they can recapture the magic and give themselves a second chance.::Martin Kennedy
