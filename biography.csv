As the film opens in 1962 General Douglas MacArthur (Gregory Peck) is at West Point his alma mater. MacArthur ramrod straight reviews the ranks of marching cadets before delivering his poignant bittersweet farewell address to the Corps.The action abruptly shifts back to the tunnels of Corregidor in early 1942 where MacArthur's besieged American and Filipino troops are desperately holding out against the victorious forces of Japan. The end is near.In Washington General George Marshall and Admiral Ernest J. King are simultaneously delivering the grim news to President Roosevelt (Dan O'Herlihy). They discuss global priorities and admit that they can't hold the Philippines. Roosevelt reluctantly decides to order MacArthur off Corregidor knowing that he will be furious. MacArthur is ordered to board a submarine and slip away to Australia where he can organize ongoing resistance. But MacArthur refuses to sneak away from his beloved command traveling furtively beneath the waves. He insists on boarding a PT boat and his family insists on accompanying him on the dangerous voyage. The Japanese navy has thrown a blockade around the islands and the heavily armed PT boats would be no match for destroyers. The pair of PT boats manage to evade the Japanese pickets and floating mines proving that the blockade can be circumvented.Eventually arriving in Melbourne MacArthur discovers that there is no Philippine relief expedition being organized. He addresses the adoring Australian crowds explaining that his first priority will be the recapture of the Philippines. But he soon learns that Bataan and Corregidor have fallen leaving 70000 of his starving men imprisoned under unimaginable conditions.MacArthur decides to mount the defense of Australia among the jungles of New Guinea where the battle is fought under brutal circumstances. As a result MacArthur develops his famous island hopping strategy bypassing Japanese strongholds through the use of Allied naval and air superiority cutting critical supply lines and starving the isolated Japanese strong points into submission. MacArthur also develops a well-earned reputation for dramatics self-promotion and vanity.The Allies advance steadily up the Southwest Pacific island chain over the next two years but not without tremendous bloodshed. Ordered to Honolulu in July 1944 to meet with President Roosevelt and Admirals Leahy and Nimitz MacArthur upstages his naval rivals with a grandiose belated arrival. His jealous distrustful relationship with Roosevelt is apparent. The US Navy wants to bypass the Philippines and take Taiwan first. MacArthur makes an impassioned argument that to do so would be an indelible stain on American honor. He reminds them that numerous promises have been made to the loyal people of the Philippines including by Roosevelt himself. In the end MacArthur's view prevails.US forces come ashore at Leyte Gulf in October 1944. In an iconic scene MacArthur insists on going ashore right behind the second wave of troops. He steps off the landing craft into knee-deep water wading ashore as the cameras roll. On the beach MacArthur addresses the Filipinos by radio exhorting them to drive the Japanese occupiers out. As the battle rages the General receives his fifth star. He is soon taken to a prison camp where many of the brutalized emaciated survivors of Bataan and Corregidor have been held for more than two years. Many emotional reunions follow.Back home President Roosevelt dies in the spring of 1945. Harry Truman succeeds him and authorizes the use of two atomic weapons to bring Japan to her knees. A furious MacArthur rails against this new impersonal brand of warfare realizing that an era has passed.Aboard the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay MacArthur presides over the solemn surrender ceremonies in September 1945.As Allied military governor of Japan MacArthur institutes liberal social reforms and oversees the complete rebuilding and modernization of Japan. When the Russian military representative in Japan curtly informs MacArthur that Russia will soon commence an illegal occupation of Hokkaido Island MacArthur just as curtly informs the Russian that the entire Soviet delegation will be thrown in jail. The occupation never occurs.MacArthur is given one last chance at military glory in June 1950 when Communist North Korean forces invade South Korea moving swiftly and nearly pushing American and South Korean forces off the peninsula. MacArthur is appointed Supreme Commander of UN forces in Korea. He buys time until he can devise a brilliant but risk-laden amphibious landing behind North Korean lines at Inchon. The successful operation proves to be a stroke of genius. North Korean forces are virtually cut off from supplies and reinforcements and have to retreat northward in disarray. MacArthur then carries the fight into North Korea itself. Despite MacArthur's reassurances to the contrary the Communist Chinese suddenly enter the war in huge numbers in order to bolster their sagging North Korean ally. UN forces are again pushed southward incurring heavy casualties. MacArthur grows increasingly frustrated chafing at political interference from Washington.Tensions between Truman and MacArthur boil over when MacArthur's insubordination in the face of direct orders threatens to undermine Truman's authority. After a stellar military career spanning more than a half-century MacArthur is relieved of command.He returns to a hero's welcome in April 1951 while Truman's popularity plummets. MacArthur delivers a moving retirement address to a joint session of Congress. The movie then moves forward to 1962 and an increasingly frail Douglas MacArthur is bidding farewell to West Point. One last time he utters the famous words that were the hallmark of his career: Duty. Honor. Country.

"The movie starts off by introducing Master Chief Leslie W. (""Billy"") Sunday (Robert DeNiro) a US Navy Diver who has recently gone AWOL. He is badly beaten and awaiting disciplinary actions. Sunday and several other Navy members watch TV coverage of an ongoing salvage operation when Sunday recognizes a familiar face on the screen. One of the other sailors makes some crude racist jokes Sunday attacks him and applies a choke hold.We then flash back about 25 years where a young African-American boy named Carl Brashear (Chris Warren Jr.) is watching his father Mac (Carl Lumbly) work the plow on their farm. Carl wants to quit school so that he will be able to help work and then prevent the farm from financial ruin. Mac is dead-set against his son being ""like him"" and stuck working on a farm but he allows Carl to help.Time passes quickly and a grown-up Carl (Cuba Gooding Jr.) is leaving town to join the Navy. Mac gives his son a custom-built portable radio as a memento of home and tells Carl to be the best even if it means breaking the rules.Carl winds up working in the kitchens on the USS Hoist in the South Pacific. He and the other black officers joke about the so-called ""bright future"" the Navy promised them. Their superior points out that black men in the US Navy have only 3 career choices- cook officer's valet or ""get the f*ck out of the Navy.""Afterwards Carl and his friends go up on deck where the white officers are swimming (the black crew members are assigned a specific day when they can swim). Carl tired and hot decides to jump in the water. The white officers try and chase him down but Carl out-swims all of them.Carl's actions get him thrown in the brig. The ships' captain meets with Carl and impressed with the boy's speed decides to transfer Carl to the search & rescue swimmers a group assigned to rescue anyone who falls overboard on ship.A few days later Carl is writing a letter home to his parents when the ship is rocked by an apparent crash. Their mail chopper has accidentally gone down in the ocean. Carl assists the others on deck in raising a Navy Diver from the sea floor with the wounded pilot. The Diver is Master Chief Sunday. Since Sunday is now back up on deck regulations state that he must now undergo decompression. As the next diver is lowered an accident with the winch severs the diver's air hose. Chief Sunday prepares to do a dangerous ""bounce dive"" to rescue his fallen ally. One officer Lt. Cmdr Hanks (David Conrad) orders Sunday not to go but Sunday disobeys and jumps off ship.Later in the hospital we see that Chief Sunday was indeed able to save the other diver but doctors find that he has sustained a severe embolism in both lungs. This condition disqualifies Sunday from any more diving. Upon hearing this news Sunday throws a fit destroying some equipment in the hospital and assaulting several of the staff. Carl is in attendance at the resulting disciplinary hearing where Sunday is officially disqualified from further diving duty and assigned to a training position. Carl having seen Sunday's actions as heroic is inspired and vows to become a Navy Master Diver.Two years later Carl is reporting for Diving School the same diving school where Sunday is the trainer. After a tense confrontation with Chief Sunday he is allowed in. While most other recruits are revolted by the thought of sharing their bunk with a Negro one Navy candidate- Snowhill (Michael Rapaport) attempts to befriend Carl. That night Carl is subjected to severe hazing by Sunday. The following morning Chief Sunday singles out Snowhill throwing him out of the program for failing to complete an impossible task. His only ally alienated Carl is once again on his own.Despite the harsh treatments Carl performs admirably in his training assembling machinery and adapting to the diving suit with much greater results than a large number of his classmates. Unfortunately Carl is falling behind in the academic requirements-scoring only a 37 on his first exam. If he fails again Carl will be kicked out of the program.One weekend on leave Carl comes to a library in the hopes of getting a tutor to help him. He meets a young woman named Jo (Aunjanue Ellis) who is studying medicine. She thinks that Carl cannot possibly succeed since he has only a 7th grade education. Carl stays the entire night at the library reading and learning more about the Navy program. Next morning Jo is so impressed by his progress that she agrees to help Carl. The two spend many evenings together eventually developing a relationship in the process. Soon Carl is back in the classroom awaiting the results of another test. As the exams are passed out Carl is elated- he's scored a 76 keeping him in the program.The next day there is a training exercise involving patching the hole in a sunken ship and raising it to the surface. All at once the ship accidentally shifts its position snaring the air hose on one diver while the other flees for his life. Carl volunteers to bring down a new line for the trapped diver and after several tense seconds Carl is able to save the young mans' life. Unfortunately due to the prejudiced environment of the time the diver who fled earlier receives a medal for his actions while Carl is ignored. Carl is however silently thanked by the recruit he saved on his way out of the school.That night Carl is in town when he meets a young woman (Charlize Theron) who introduces herself as Gwen Sunday the chief's wife. Gwen takes Carl into the same bar her husband and his fellow divers frequent. Carl and Sunday confront each other whereby Carl says he knows he's better than Sunday. They face off in a competition using pressurized diving helmets to determine who can hold their breath the longest. The stakes are if Sunday wins Carl leaves town that very night but if Carl wins Chief Sunday must re-admit Snowhill into the diving program. Carl manages to win but is again overlooked for his actions. Carl sees Jo watching the confrontation with dismay as she storms out of the bar. He gives chase and she reveals that she's been accepted into an internship and she won't have time to help Carl anymore. Carl smitten asks Jo to marry him. Jo contemplates driving off in a taxi but she returns and accepts.Chief Sunday meets with Captain ""Pappy"" (Hal Holbrook) the eccentric senior officer at the training school. Chief Sunday states that Carl has scored a 94 on his final test meaning that all Carl has to do is complete his last training exercise (a timed exercise) and he will have passed all requirements for graduation. Pappy is not at all happy at the prospect of a ""colored diver"" but Sunday seems hesitant to agree.Sunday confronts Carl yet again. After Carl fires an insult back Sunday smashes the radio Carl's father gave him. Upon seeing Carl's fury at this Sunday sees the inscription no the radio ASNF (a son never forgets) and Carl's father's picture by his bed. Sunday asks what his father said to make him try so hard. Carl simply states ""Be the best."" Sunday admits that he is but that he shouldn't show up the following day because Pappy will not let him pass the school. Carl is furious.Next morning Chief Sunday explains the final exercise to the recruits- they must assemble a flange underwater pieces are on the river bottom and tools will be provided once the parts are found. They will earn points based on the speed of their work but there is no set time limit and air will be provided to the diving suits for as long as the divers can stand the cold water. Carl makes a defiant entrance to the exercise and is looked upon with a measure of respect from the other recruits finally.Carl is among the first to find the parts for his project but when he calls up for tools the attendants cut a hole in the tool bag sending them cascading all over the river bottom. Carl frantically searches for all the necessary parts.As time goes by the recruits slowly but surely complete the assignment. Carl remains in the water well into the night. The other recruits having showered and put on warm clothes have returned to see Carl finish. Pappy orders Sunday to leave Carl in the water until he stops moving. Sunday however decides that too much time has passed already and gives the order to bring Carl back up. This makes Sunday's colleagues uneasy as it violates a direct order from Pappy. The other recruits step up but just as they begin to haul in the lines Carl's project flange comes to the surface completed. After 9 hours and 31 minutes in the excruciatingly cold water Carl Brashear has passed his final and essentially graduated with honors from Diving School.As Carl leaves the barracks next day Snowhill runs in to talk to him. He has been asked to rejoin the diving program. He also states that Pappy has thrown Sunday out of the school as trainer. Carl also finds his father's radio fully repaired with ""A son never forgets"" freshly carved into the side.Some time later Carl and his wife are in a nightclub. Carl orders champagne as a celebration because he's been offered a job with Brooklyn Navy Yard. Carl doesn't know if he should accept the job since he won't move up in rank as just a stand-by diver. Jo confesses that she is three months late and Carl is suddenly overjoyed at the prospect of being a father.At a New Years' party Sunday and his wife run into Lt. Hanks- the man who ended Sunday's diving career. Despite his best efforts to remain civil Sunday ends up attacking the lieutenant. Charges are filed against Sunday for assaulting a superior officer and he suffers a rank reduction.The scene then shifts back to Chief Sunday watching a TV report explaining the current salvage operations. Earlier that day an American B-52 bomber crashed in Spain. Before impact it released its payload of three 50-megaton warheads on parachutes. Two have been recovered but the last one is lost at sea. Furthermore maritime law dictates that since the bomb vanished in international waters whoever finds it first will be considered the true owner. So the US Divers are racing against Russian submarines to be the first to find the missing nuke.Carl is one of several divers assigned to try and find the missing bomb. At one point Carl finds a metal object on the sea floor but it turns out to be a mere Coke can. At that moment sonar signals in the water are detected- there is a Russian submarine is Carls' immediate vicinity. Carl spots the sub and tries to run for cover but his air line is caught by the sub and he is dragged along the ocean floor. After several tense seconds Carl is able to contact the surface and tell them that he is unhurt. As they prepare to bring him home Carl notices a large metal object nearby. The sub's movement has caused most of the silt and debris on the ocean floor to move aside essentially finding the nuke for them!Back on deck Carl watches as the bomb is brought on board. An accident with the winch on deck causes the lines holding the bomb to snap. Carl shoves several other deck hands aside but his own leg is caught by the snapped wire.Carl wakes up later in a hospital with Jo by his side. Jo explains that Carl's leg was nearly severed by the impact but doctors think he will walk again. Carl realizes that this injury has put an end to his diving career and he is devastated.Meanwhile Chief Sunday has fallen on hard times since his rank reduction. He is now in a rehab clinic undergoing detox for alcoholism. With the support of his wife Sunday gets back on his feet. He recognizes Carl from a news story about the accident.Carl is still in the hospital he is reading a news story that was sent to him (presumably by Sunday) about amputee pilots being able to return to duty. He speaks with his superiors (including the now-Captain Hanks). Carl wants to return to full diving duty but they feel that it is impossible in his current state. Carl voices his desire to have the damaged leg amputated and return after a fitting with a prosthesis. Jo is furious about Carl's reckless and apparently selfish attitude and walks out.Later Carl's leg is indeed amputated. He begins the difficult process of learning to move and act with a prosthetic. Chief Sunday shows up and asks if he can help Carl. Sunday begins training him again and makes a deal with Captain Hanks. He will get four weeks to complete training Carl before a medical hearing with the Chief of Naval Personnel in Washington. Hanks agrees on the condition that Sunday take immediate retirement if and when Carl fails to return to duty.A month later Carl appears before the Naval Personnel and they discuss his possible return. Chief Sunday has been ordered to wait outside the courtroom by Captain Hanks. Captain Hanks outlines a new requirement for Navy Divers- a new diving suit weighing in at 290 pounds has been approved for use and anyone wanting to use it must take 12 steps unassisted. Carl seeing that Jo and his son are in the audience volunteers to take the 12 steps right then and there. Chief Sunday bursts into the courtroom. He is asked to leave by Hanks but after introducing himself to some of the more senior members of the court who know of his past heroics is allowed to stay.Chief Sunday helps Carl suit up and then proceeds to coach him through the ordeal. Carl stands up in the new suit and-with obvious great discomfort- takes a few clumsy steps forward. Everyone assumes that his prosthetic will snap and as he nears failure he is ordered to stand down by Captain Hanks. Sunday orders Carl to disregard as he is the officer in charge of this exercise. He begins shouting orders at Carl (identical to their first session at diving school years before). Carl struggles but keeps moving forward until he has reached the twelfth step.Captain Hanks realizing that no more can be done to prevent Carl from succeeding announces that the Navy will be reinstating Carl Brashear to full diving duty.Carl and Sunday salute one another and Sunday marches out of the courtroom.Text at the end reveals that in 1968 Carl Brashear was the first African-American amputee to assume Navy diving duty and that two years after his reinstatement Carl was promoted to Master Chief. Carl continued in his Naval career for another nine years before finally taking retirement."

By the mid-1950's Bettie Page had become the number one pin up girl in the USA. Despite being abused by her father as a child and gang-raped as a teenager Bettie had few hang-ups and was actually quite innocent.

"John Nash (Russell Crowe) arrives at Princeton University as a new graduate student. He is a recipient of the prestigious Carnegie Prize for mathematics. Though he was promised a single room his roommate Charles (Paul Bettany) a literature student greets him as he moves in and soon becomes his best friend. Nash also meets a group of other promising math and science graduate students Martin Hansen (Josh Lucas) Sol (Adam Goldberg) Ainsley (Jason Gray-Stanford) and Bender (Anthony Rapp) with whom he strikes up an awkward friendship. Nash admits to Charles that he is better with numbers than people which comes as no surprise to them after watching his largely unsuccessful attempts at conversation with the women at the local bar.Nash is seeking a truly original idea for his thesis paper and he is under increasing pressure to develop his thesis so he can begin work. A particularly harsh rejection from a woman at the bar is what ultimately inspires his fruitful work in the concept of governing dynamics a theory in mathematical economics.After the conclusion of Nash's studies as a student at Princeton he accepts a prestigious appointment at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) along with his friends Sol and Bender.Five years later while teaching a class on Calculus at MIT he places a particularly interesting problem on the chalkboard that he dares his students to solve. When his student Alicia Larde (Jennifer Connelly) comes to his office to discuss the problem the two fall in love and eventually marry.On a return visit to Princeton Nash runs into his former roommate Charles and meets Charles' young niece Marcee (Vivien Cardone) whom he adores. He also encounters a mysterious Department of Defense agent William Parcher (Ed Harris). Nash is invited to a secret United States Department of Defense facility in the Pentagon to crack a complex encryption of an enemy telecommunication. Nash is able to decipher the code mentally to the astonishment of other codebreakers.Parcher observes Nash's performance from above while partially concealed behind a screen. Parcher gives Nash a new assignment to look for patterns in magazines and newspapers ostensibly to thwart a Soviet plot. He must write a report of his findings and place them in a specified mailbox. After being chased by the Russians and an exchange of gunfire Nash becomes increasingly paranoid and begins to behave erratically.After observing this erratic behavior Alicia informs a psychiatric hospital. Later while delivering a guest lecture at Harvard University Nash realizes that he is being watched by a hostile group of people. Although he attempts to flee he is forcibly sedated and sent to a psychiatric facility. Nash's internment seemingly confirms his belief that the Soviets were trying to extract information from him. He views the officials of the psychiatric facility as Soviet kidnappers.Alicia desperate to help her husband visits the mailbox and retrieves all of the never-opened ""top secret"" documents that Nash had delivered there. When confronted with this evidence Nash is finally convinced that he has been hallucinating. The Department of Defense agent William Parcher and Nash's secret assignment to decode Soviet messages was in fact all a delusion. Even more surprisingly Nash's friend Charles and his niece Marcee are also only products of Nash's mind.After a painful series of insulin shock therapy sessions Nash is released on the condition that he agrees to take antipsychotic medication. However the drugs create negative side-effects that affect his relationship with his wife and most dramatically his intellectual capacity. Frustrated Nash secretly stops taking his medication and hoards his pills triggering a relapse of his psychosis.While bathing his infant son Nash becomes distracted and wanders off. Alicia is hanging laundry in the backyard and observes that the back gate is open. She discovers that Nash has turned an abandoned shed in a nearby grove of trees into an office for his work for Parcher. Upon realizing what has happened Alicia runs into the house to confront Nash and barely saves their child from drowning in the bathtub. When she confronts him Nash claims that his friend Charles was watching their son. Alicia runs to the phone to call the psychiatric hospital for emergency assistance. Parcher urges Nash to kill his wife but Nash angrily refuses to do such a thing. After arguing with Parcher Nash accidentally knocks Alicia to the ground. Afterwards Alicia flees the house in fear with their child but Nash steps in front of her car to prevent her from leaving. After a moment Nash realizes that Marcee is a figment of his hallucinations because she has remained the same age since the day he met her. He tells Alicia ""She never gets old."" Only then does he accept that all three people are in fact part of his hallucinations. (It is important to note that in real life Nash suffered from auditory hallucinations and possible delusions instead of visual hallucinations).Caught between the intellectual paralysis of the antipsychotic drugs and his delusions Nash and Alicia decide to try to live with his abnormal condition. Nash consciously says goodbye to the three of them forever in his attempts to ignore his hallucinations and not feed his demons. However he thanks Charles for being his best friend over the years and says a tearful goodbye to Marcee stroking her hair and calling her ""baby girl"" telling them both he wouldn't speak to them anymore.Nash grows older and approaches his old friend and intellectual rival Martin Hansen now head of the Princeton mathematics department who grants him permission to work out of the library and audit classes though the university will not provide him with his own office. Though Nash still suffers from hallucinations and mentions taking newer medications he is ultimately able to live with and largely ignore his psychotic episodes. He takes his situation in stride and humorously checks to ensure that any new acquaintances are in fact real people not hallucinations.Nash eventually earns the privilege of teaching again. He is honored by his fellow professors for his achievement in mathematics and goes on to win the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics for his revolutionary work on game theory. Nash and Alicia are about to leave the auditorium in Stockholm when John sees Charles Marcee and Parcher standing and smiling. Alicia asks John ""What's wrong?"" John replies ""Nothing."" With that they both leave the auditorium.(Source: WikiPedia. Bangs_McCoy)"

"The film opens up in the early morning. A man is cycling by as a paper boy is driving around delivering newspapers. A newspaper hits a door and the main articles title is Life Has A Mind by Steve Lopez (Robert Downey Jr.). Steve Lopez is cycling around town and goes in the opposite direction of a bunch of cyclists. Lopez gives an internal monologue chronicling a biking accident which occurred near a construction site. His bike hits a bump and he hits his head badly on the pavement. In the next scene hes in an ambulance being driven to a busy hospital. While in the emergency room Lopez writes down his thoughts as if writing an article. He is given an MRI and after being cleared takes a taxi home. He checks his messages (there are none) continues to narrate into a tape recorder.The next morning he goes into work at the L.A. Times. He continues to talk to himself as he walks through the halls about how much he hates hospitals and health care under the governor. The Editor of the L.A. Times Mary (Catherine Keener) walks down the cubicles past Steve as he is greeted by the people in the neighboring cubicles. Steve and Mary banter about an article Steve was supposed to write before his accident but he tells her that he wont write it as she goes off to her office.Steve is then sitting outside on the boardwalk drinking a soda. He hears a violin playing and starts to walk around the plaza until he finds the sources. He finds Nathaniel Ayers (Jamie Foxx) playing a two string violin under a statue. Steve immediately realizes that Ayers is a schizophrenic and tries to walk away but Ayers follows him for a bit until Steve introduces himself. Ayers tells Steve that he once went to Julliard.Steve is in his office making a call to the Registrars office at Julliard when Mary sits down next to him. She tells him that the LA times stock situation is looking pretty dire before switching the conversation over to their son. Mary tells Steve to call him but Steve says that whenever he calls their son wont call him back. He sends her away stating that he is trying to find a story before deadline. The Registrars office tells Steve that there is no record of a Nathaniel Ayers ever attending Julliard and then hangs up on Steve. He says hes not taking the blood story but as he crosses violinist off his list of potential stories its clear hes out of options. He is then seen sitting in front of a young nurse preparing to draw blood from him. As part of his blood test he goes to urinate in a cup. While hes peeing he drops the cup and slips when he gets a callback from Julliard. The Secretary tells Steve that she only checked the graduates but when she checked all students she found that Nathaniel Ayers dropped out of Julliard during his second year.That night Steve returns to where he met Nathaniel and narrates the content of the article Points West detailing how Nathaniel is missing while calling him shy. Steve drives back to his apartment and finds that raccoons ruined his lawn. His neighbor tells him that coyote urine will keep the raccoons away. Steve spends the night walking around his messy apartment while listening to music. The next morning Steve is calling the head of the coyote urine business when he sees Nathaniel on the side of a busy intersection. He stops his car. Nathaniel turns away from him and continues to play his 2 string violin and doesnt speak. Steve waits patiently against the gate for Nathaniel to finish up. Nathaniel plays the same group of notes over and over until he cant do it anymore. Steve tells Nathaniel that he wants to write a piece about him and how he ended up on the street. Steve asks him about his family but Nathaniel cant focus and give direct answers and continues to ramble even asking if Steve is the pilot of a plane flying overhead at one point.Steve calls Nathaniels sister to learn more about him. A flashback shows a young Nathaniel walking down the street carrying a cello. He met with his music teacher and went on and on about how much he admired Beethovens work. He played the cello for his teacher and the teacher thought that he was an incredibly gifted student. Instead of playing sports his sister said that all Nathaniel would do was play the Cello. Nathaniels mother told him that when she listened to him play she heard the voice of God. Steve writes an article detailing what he learned from Nathaniels sister. After it is published an old lady reads it and sends Steve her old cello with the request that he give it to Nathaniel with her prayers. As Steve is driving through the same busy intersection he almost hits Nathaniel who is picking up litter from the middle of the street (almost being hit multiple times by other cars) and gets him to walk over to the side. Steve is concerned about Nathaniels safety and the cello and arranges for Nathaniel to keep the cello in the office of a homeless shelter LAMP (under the stipulation that Nathaniel also stay at the same shelter). Steve lets Nathaniel play the instrument on the street for a test run. Nathaniel plays for Steve and Steve is visibly moved by the piece. Steve drives away with the cello to take it to the shelter.The shelter is located in a bad neighborhood where a bunch of homeless people are gathered on the sidewalk outside the gate. He pulls up to the gate and asks to speak to someone named David. He and David put the cello in his office and Steve sticks around to wait for Nathaniel. He sees all the people with their problems and seems a bit troubled. He goes outside and continues to wait for Nathaniel. He mingles with several homeless people. He waits until nightfall and then goes home. He starts to put tie up a bag of coyote urine onto a tree when the bag explodes on him.The next morning Steve is seen interviewing an Atheist road-side cleanup worker on the side of the road. when he gets a phone call and hears Nathaniel playing the Cello. He goes back to the shelter and sees Nathaniel playing for the people gathered around.Another flashback shows Nathaniel in his first apartment and subsequent performances at Julliard. At one point he is surrounded by people and in the next he is in an empty auditorium. His musical performances grow more erratic and his paranoia starts to set in as a voice says they can hear your thoughts Nathaniel. He runs out of the auditorium and runs away because the voices tell him to. He hides in a closet and lets the voices overwhelm him. He calls his 'mother' from a payphone and shares the fact that he cant always tell what is going on in the world around him and that he cant differentiate whats real and whats not and drops the phone and the recording ""please hang up and try your call again"" is heard. It's obvious he wasn't actually talking to his mother but rather a dial tone. Steve asks David if he will diagnose Nathanials problem. David says that it would be pointless. Steve asks if theres a medication that can help Nathaniel but David tells him that the last thing he needs is another person telling him he needs medication. Steve goes to find Nathaniel but Nathaniel is gone. Steve goes out to his car and just sits there observing the interactions of the people outside before going to find Nathaniel. He walks past some drug users and down the street before seeing the police around a dead body. As he looks down to see the person he sees Nathaniel next to him. Nathaniel finds a place to sleep and starts cleaning the area a little with a broom before setting up his bed. He tells Steve that he will end up like Beethoven and lie down and die. Steve spends the night with Nathaniel on the street and they talk. Steve tells Nathaniel that it is no place for him to live but Nathaniel is adamant that this is where he should be.The next morning Steve offers to bring Nathaniel to see an Orchestra perform Beethoven. Nathaniel watches the orchestra with Steve and as they perform Nathaniel focuses only on the music and imagines each sound striking up a bright color.Later on Steve and Mary are at a karaoke bar with their coworkers and Steve is telling her about Nathaniels enjoyment of the music and the grace Nathaniel gets listening to music. Steve finds Nathaniels love of music to be awe inspiring. He upsets Mary when he tells her the he has never loved anything like Nathaniel loves music. He tries to recover from that but Mary leaves and tells him the Mayor wants to talk to him. The Mayor announces that he intends to add 50 million dollars in aid to the citys homeless community.Nathaniel visits Steve at the office. Steve is busy and tells Nathaniel he cant perform in front of the building so Nathaniel waits on the other side of the building. He calls Graham Clayton (Tom Hollander) a cellist to rehabilitate Nathaniel. Steve convinces David to help find Nathaniel an apartment where Nathaniel can live and rehabilitation. Nathaniel doesnt want to live in an apartment. He frustrates Steve but then starts to question Steve about his family. Steve was once married to Mary but they divorced. Their son Tom is in college and wont talk to Steve. Steve tells Nathaniel that if he doesnt go to the apartment he will be on his own. Another flashback details Nathaniels mental breakdown in his old apartment. He is slowly driven insane by the voices until he cries on the floor of the apartment. A week later Steve and Nathaniel move Nathaniel into the place where he will live and practice. It is a small apartment with a bed and a bathroom. There is enough room for Nathaniel to be comfortable and practice but Nathaniel is afraid to enter the room. Steve patiently tells Nathaniel that he can do it. Eventually Nathaniel enters the room with his stuff. Nathaniel doesnt like the room because it doesnt have the natural sounds of the city and reminds him of the night he spent going insane.Steve introduces Graham and Nathaniel. Graham brings Nathaniel the sheet music for Bach to begin Nathaniels rehabilitation. Graham is impressed by Nathaniels skill but notices that it needs to be refined. Graham tells Nathaniel that God gave Nathaniel a gift and that Nathaniel shouldnt waste it. Nathaniel gets upset with Graham and declares that Steve is his God. Steve gets frustrated with Nathaniel for being so attached to him. Steve asks David to help Nathaniel with psychiatry and medication and tells David that if he puts Nathaniel into forced rehab for two weeks that might be enough to get Nathaniel straightened out.Steve goes to an award show which honors Steves achievement in bringing Nathaniels story to focus. Nathaniel calls Steve and tells him all the things he needs. Steve hands the phone off to Mary and she listens to all the things Nathaniel says. She gets drunk and tells Steve that hes good at avoiding responsibility. Steve calls her a drunk and tells her she needs someone to drive her home.Graham calls Steve the next day and tells Steve that Nathaniel should have a recital. At the recital Nathaniel wheels out his card and takes out his cello before sitting down in front of the audience. As Nathaniel starts to play he begins to have a psychotic episode and hear the voices. He experiences a flashback to when his sister was taking care of him after he fled Julliard. She tries to give him a bowl of soup but Nathaniel insists that it is poison and instead takes the spoon and starts force feeding her instead. Graham puts his hand on Nathaniel to bring him back to reality but Nathaniel freaks out and the movie flashes between Nathaniel swinging a chair at Graham and the younger Nathaniel swinging the tray at his sister before he runs out the building. Steve picks up Nathaniels cello and looks for Nathaniel with his car. Again the movie flashes back to when Nathaniel freaked out on his sister and him running away with her following him in her car int he middle of winter and asking him where he is going and where he would sleep.As Steve searches for Nathaniel he sees the police launching a large scale arrest of the homeless and drug users. Steve finds police guarding a bloody shirt and is told that a bunch of kids with baseball bats beat a man brutally. Steve convinced it's Nathaniel checks every hospital in the area looking for him. He spends all night looking for him. The next morning Steve gets a call from David telling him that Nathaniel is at the shelter eating breakfast and that he spent the night in the apartment. Steve visits Nathaniel at his apartment and returns his cello. Steve gives Nathaniel a miniature Beethoven and asks him if he did a good job looking out for him. Jennifer Nathaniels sister is ready to take over as Nathaniels caretaker. Steve leaves him the forms and tells him to read them before he signs them.Nathanial reads the forms and throws them around the room when he realizes that its about his schizophrenic state of mind. Nathaniel gets violent with Steve pushing and slapping him and tells him that if he sees him again hell gut him like a fish. Steve runs out of the apartment the minute he gets free and leaves Nathaniel to the voices.A little while later Steve is taking shots in a bar. He visits Mary at her house. They reminisce about when they moved into the house with Tom. Steve comes to grip with his failures as a father and a husband. He apologizes to Mary and tells her that he thought he was helping someone with a gift who had lost their way. He tells her about what happened with Nathaniel and how he doesnt know how to fix it. He tells her that he officially resigns from everything since he cant get it right. Mary tells him that Steve would never have been able to cure Nathaniel just like he would never prevent a earthquake and that all Steve could do was be his friend.Jennifer flies into L.A. to see her brother. Steve drives her to the shelter and she goes in to see him. The shelter is not as crowded as it was before the cops arrested people. Jennifer sees Nathaniel sitting and slowly approaches him. They sit together for a while as Steve watches from the car. Nathaniel remembers that Jennifer is his sister and reaches out his hand to her and she takes it. Steve sits outside dangling his car keys until the pair come out. Nathaniel looks down at Steve and apologizes for threatening Steve. Steve tells Nathaniel that its ok. Mr. Ayers Im honored to be your friend.Steve begins his narrative epilogue as Mary Steve Jennifer and Nathaniel watch an orchestra perform. A year ago he met Nathaniel and thought that he could help him. His mental state and well being havent changed but he no longer lives on the street. Psychiatrists tell Steve that his friendship alone gives balance to chemical misfire in his brain but he cant attest to it. Steve tells himself that Nathaniels friendship and courage has made him a better person. They watch the orchestra perform in silence.Credits roll and the audience reads the following: Mr. Ayers still sleeps inside and is a member of LAMP. He continues to play the cello as well as violin bass piano guitar trumpet French horn drums and harmonica. Mr. Lopez continues to write his column for the L.A. Times. He is learning to play the guitar. There are 90000 homeless people on the streets of Greater Los Angelos."

The biography of the pioneering French microbiologist who helped revolutionize agriculture and medicine.::Kenneth Chisholm
In 1860 Paris chemist Louis Pasteur is considered a quack within the medical community for advocating that doctors and surgeons wash their hands and boil their instruments to destroy microbes that can kill their patients. He came across this belief when discovering microscopic organisms in sour wine the organisms which could be killed if heated sufficiently. The belief among the scientific community at large is that the organisms are the result of disease and not the cause. This belief is despite the fact that thirty percent of women die in childbirth due to child bed disease accounting for twenty thousand annual deaths in Paris alone. The debate takes Pasteur all the way to a meeting with Emperor Napoleon III and his physician Dr. Charbonnet who is one of the leading opponents of Pasteur. Several years later - France now a republic - much of Pasteur's reputation changes as a government sanctioned experiment with anthrax and sheep shows that a vaccine created by Pasteur proves effective. As Pasteur begins work on finding the cause and a cure for rabies which proves a more difficult challenge he still has his detractors including Dr. Charbonnet. This continuing debate brings about his biggest challenge: proving that microbes are the cause of all disease. Through it all he is supported not only by his family but Dr. Jean Martel who was once a junior physician in the emperor's court and a physician within the republic's government but who now works with Pasteur and is his son-in-law. But an act of bravado by Charbonnet may ultimately prove to be the breakthrough for which Pasteur is looking. Moving the experimental treatments from animals to humans proves a bigger obstacle as is Charbonnet's need to win at all cost in the court of public opinion.::Huggo
Hollywood version of famous scientist Louis Pasteur and his work with microbes and their role in disease. Few in the medical community believed Pasteur's theories in this area and after an encounter with the Emperor leaves Paris. Some years later officials in Paris hear that there is no anthrax in the area of Arbois. They soon learn that Pasteur is living in there and has in fact developed a vaccine. Skeptics abound but a real-life test proves that his vaccine works. He next sets out to find find the microbe responsible for rabies which proves to be quite elusive. Through a fluke he and his assistant discover that a weakened dose of rabies helps the human immune system create its own antibodies. The approach is far from fully developed but he agrees to treat a young boy who was attacked by a mad dog. The treatment was a great success and further experiments lead to a cure.::garykmcd
In 1860 having helped France solve the problem of sour wine chemist Louis Pasteur turns to the dangers of childbirth: 20000 Paris women were dying annually. His germ theory and recommendation that doctors wash their hands and sterilize their instruments meet with derision in the academy and the emperor himself orders Pasteur to be silent. Ten years later needing cash to pay for war losses the government finds that anthrax is killing herds everywhere in the country except Arbois: Pasteur is there vaccinating sheep. Again the academy is dismissive. When Pasteur is vindicated he turns his attention to hydrophobia. It is the Russians who realize his genius and France finally honors him.::<jhailey@hotmail.com>

"Scotland 1970. The sky is cloudy and stark grey and a group of newly graduated students jump into the lake to celebrate. Newly minted doctor Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy) is having dinner with his mother (Barbara Rafferty) and father (David Ashton) also a doctor. It is a drab affair and the father assumes Nicholas will join the family practice. We are left with an impression that Nicholas's father is a controlling man.In his room Nicholas spins a globe promising himself ""first place you land you go first place you land you go."" Shutting his eyes he jabs the spinning globe. Opening his eyes he sees that his finger has landed on Canada. Thinking about it for a moment or two he spins the globe again and this time his finger lands on Uganda.Credits roll as we are in Uganda. It is bright sunny lush and full of activities and life. Nicholas is riding the bus and becomes friendly with a young woman . A line of military vehicles and tanks pass the bus on their way to a military coup to overthrow president Obote. Nicholas is completely clueless and the young woman assures Nicholas they are safe and it will be a great time for Uganda now that Idi Amin (Forest Whitaker) will be president. Nicholas and the young woman have sex in her home.Nicholas arrives at his destination and meets Sarah (Gillian Anderson) the pretty wife of Dr. Merrit (Adam Kotz) whom he will be working for in a rural clinic. Merrit is a dedicated doctor a ""good man"" who frequently leaves his wife and Nicholas alone in the clinic while he attends emergency cases several miles away. Nicholas offers to accompany Merrit or attend to an emergency case himself but Merrit dismissively tells him to stay at the clinic. Nicholas is disappointed with his latest 'father figure'. Sarah has a world-weariness about her.Though 80% of the villagers prefer their witch doctors Nicholas still has his hands full with treatments and inoculations. While playing soccer with the village children he hears that Amin will be giving a speech nearby and convinces Sarah to attend the rally with him. The two really stand out in the rally as they are the only white people there. Listening to Amin orating to a crowd of Ugandans Nicholas is deeply impressed and enjoys the high spiritedness around him. Amin promises a reign of peace prosperity public health care and other visionary advancements. Nicholas sees Amin as the rest of the world first sees him; a charismatic and entertaining figure who was greeted with enthusiasm by his people and who seemed to have their interests at heart.Driving back to the clinic Sarah cynically said the Ugandans gave the same party to Obote before throwing him out. Nicholas thinks Sarah should give the man a chance to do his job before criticizing him. They are interrupted by terrified soldiers begging them to come treat Amin who has been in an accident. The scared soldier is our first clue of Amin's true character.The presidential motorcade has collided with a cow and Amin is sure that his hand is broken. Nicholas quickly determines that the injury is just a sprain and works to bandage Amin's hand. Unable to concentrate on his bandaging on account of the dying cow's incessant bellowing Nicholas impulsively grabs a pistol sitting on the car and shoots the cow putting it out of its misery. With 10 machine guns immediately trained on him Nicholas stammers an apology and returns the gun to a menacing Amin who demands to know if Nicholas is British. Nicholas clarifies that he is Scottish and shows his emblem tee shirt under his first shirt. Amin's behavior immediately does a 180 degree turn and praises the Scottish culture and people especially their historical warriors. Nicholas is confused but charmed by this man who seems to take a genuine interest in him. Amin asks for Nicholas's tee shirt for his son Campbell and the two men exchange shirts. Amin's military shirt sits like an oversize coat on Nicholas.Later that night Nicholas invites Sarah for drinks on the porch. Knowing full well of Nicholas's intention Sarah confides that as a wife of a ""good man"" she is often unnoticed and undervalued. Nicholas is empathetic as his own father is a ""good man"". Nicholas kisses her; Sarah quickly comes to her senses and leaves Nicholas alone. The next day the Ugandan Health Minister who is Amin's #1 adviser arrives to bring Nicholas to Amin in the presidential limousine. Thinking that the hypochondriac Amin just wants him to re-tie the bandages Nicholas promises Sarah that he will return soon and is whisked away to the bustling capital an active modern city and a far cry from the dilapidated village Nicholas is working in.Nicholas meets Amin and is taken back by the offer to be his personal physician. In an example where Amin's craziness seems benign at first he tells Nicholas that he has already dreamed the date of his own death. ""I know exactly when I'm going to die so you do not need to worry about making a mistake"". Nicholas turns down the job offer twice and Amin guesses that Nicholas has an infatuation with a married woman back in the village. He promises to take Nicholas back to the village first thing in the morning but first he must attend tonight's state dinner. Since Nicholas does not have a suit Amin sends him to a tailor.Measured for a suit by Asian tailors (they are either Indian or Pakistanis) Nicholas worries about the cost and the tailor assures him it is covered by the president's account. Overhearing this is a British diplomat Stone. Outside the tailor shop Nicholas hears a commotion and sees a man being chased by Amin's men who catch the man and stuff him into the trunk of their car. Amin's men are hunting down suspected Obote supporters. Stone praises Amin's ""firm hand"" - after all he trained among Scottish soldiers with the King's African Rifles. Stone says Amin is one of their own.The state dinner is a lavish affair and Nicholas is introduced to Amin's wives. Wife #1 has given Amin 5 children and wife #2 has given Amin 3 children. The third wife is simply introduced as Kay. Kay tersely thanks Nicholas for the tee shirt for her son Campell it is her way of saying she has given Amin a child as well. Amin makes a rousing speech starting with stories of Greeks stealing philosophies and Arabs stealing medicine knowledge from Africa and claiming them as their own. He says Uganda will be an independent and great African country and please enjoy the food as he humorously promises that it contains no human flesh. Nicholas meets Stone again and Stone remarks that it is nice to have another Englishman around. Nicholas peevishly clarifies that he is a Scotsman. Amin's fondness for Nicholas is obvious and the British diplomats tease Nicholas that Amin has ""clasped you to his bosom"".Nicholas is woken in the middle of the night by the frantic servant and summoned to Amin's bedroom. Amin is lying in bed in pain sure he has been poisoned. Nicholas palpates the stomach and notice glasses of beer and aspirin on the night stand. He finds a baseball bat presses it against Amin's stomach and a large amount of gas is released. Amin immediately feels better and the Health Minister who was watching the entire scene leaves. Amin is ashamed and upset that Nicholas has seen him in his greatest weakness; fear and paranoia. Nicholas assures confidentiality due to the doctor's oath. Amin opens up a bit to Nicholas with stories from his childhood while the soundtrack tells us that Nicholas has been unwittingly trapped.Some time later Nicholas calls Sarah to apologize for accepting Amin's offer. In the background Amin is playing with his numerous children. Nicholas is given a swanky apartment in the immaculate presidential compound and his job is set up in the Presidential Hospital where he meets his predecessor Dr. Junju. At the hospital he runs into Stone again who wants to use Nicholas as a spy due to his exceptional access to Amin. Nicholas rebuffs Stone's offer nonetheless Stone cautions him to ""keep in touch.""Nicholas enjoys the benefits of being in Amin's inner circle and Amin takes him everywhere except outside Uganda. Due to their great physical differences Nicholas looks something like Amin's pet or trophy. Very soon Nicholas is more than Amin's personal physician but also his most trusted advisor something Amin says many times in front of senior officers. One day Amin tells Nicholas to attend a meeting in his place as he has to go to Libya at the last minute. Nicholas arrives at the meeting and introduces himself. The attendees are surprised that Nicholas is a doctor and Nicholas is surprised to learn the attendees are important contractors from the foreign consulates. The meeting is to bid for construction contracts.Dressed in Islamic garbs Amin examines the model for the new building and is pleased with the design Nicholas has chosen. Praising Nicholas's good taste Amin tells the Health Minister he has no sense of style. The Health Minister simply stares at Amin. Amin's pleasant mood turns sour and he sends the Health Minister away. Amin asks Nicholas if he thought the Health Minister looked at Amin strangely. Nicholas says no.While examining X-ray pictures Nicholas and Junju hear a series of explosions. Rushing to the hospital roof they see columns of smoke rising in the distant hills where political prisoners are held in a prison. Gunfire can be heard. A messenger comes running looking for Nicholas saying that the President's son is sick. Nicholas is taken to a house and finds a distressed Kay hovering over a boy in the midst of a seizure. Nicholas assumes that the boy is Campbell but Kay says he is Mackenzie. It is clear Nicholas never heard of or seen Mackenzie before despite being the family's physician and it is clearer that Kay and the servants have no idea Mackenzie's condition is called epilepsy. Nicholas wants to take Mackenzie to the hospital but Kay begs Nicholas not to as she and her son are banished from the palace. Kay says Amin regards her as a ""bad omen"" wife because of Mackenzie's condition and they cannot live in the palace with the other families. Nicholas gives Mackenzie a shot to calm the seizure and then puts him to bed. Nicholas finds it ridiculous that Mackenzie does not have access to medical attention and makes an appointment for McKenzie at the hospital. Kay looks at Nicholas differently this time.Amin is hosting a state event and he is dressed in Scottish garb kilt and all. Scottish folk songs are sung in African arrangements. During the ceremony Kay and Nicholas exchange glances; Amin notices this. The following morning Nicholas is woken early by Amin. To thank Nicholas for helping his epileptic son Amin gives him a brand new silver Mercedes convertible. Nicholas is beyond thrilled and Amin wants Nicholas to drive him to the airport. Nicholas returns to his apartment to change only to see that Amin has followed him into his room. Realizing Amin is not going to leave Nicholas quickly changes his clothes and asks about the explosions and gunfire heard coming from the hills. Amin says his men held off Obete's men at the prison and quickly changes the subject.Driving together to the airport following the presidential limousine Amin tells Nicholas that his epileptic son has all the material comfort he needs. Nicholas argues that exiling the boy denies him treatment and a father's attention. Amin counters that Nicholas has never been poor. Their argument is interrupted by trucks of assassins targeting the presidential limousine. Nicholas manages to drive Amin out of harm's way.Once secured and surrounded by military men Amin freaks out and repeats to Nicholas that he cannot die because he saw it in his dream. Amin continues to rant and vent about traitors while Nicholas is silent and shell shocked. Amin begins screaming for his number #1 advisor the Health Minister and belittles Nicholas for not knowing where he is. A solider comes to Amin to tell him some of the assassins are caught. Amin brings Nicholas with him to see the captured assassins who are being tortured. While Amin screams and rants at the prisoners Nicholas looks down and notices there is blood on his hand.Nicholas is shaken by the recent events and goes to a Holiday Inn lounge to unwind and calm down. There he sees the Health Minister talking to a white man in a secretive manner. Some time later Nicholas is in Amin's office having him sign papers for supplies for the hospital. As he is leaving Amin calls Nicholas back and asks him what is on his mind as it is obvious Nicholas is distracted. Nicholas admits he saw the Health Minister at the Holiday Inn lounge talking to a strange white man. It's probably nothing but perhaps Amin should talk to the Health Minister. Nicholas reiterates it is likely ""nothing.""While lounging in the pool in presidential compound Nicholas sees Kay and MacKenzie playing in the pool with the rest of the family. Kay tells Nicholas that Mackenzie is doing much better now that he is allowed to return to the palace and play with his brothers. Kay seems happy for the first time and looks at Nicholas fondly. While Nicholas is admiring Kay Stone arrives and tells Nicholas that people are disappearing in the countryside. Out of loyalty and ignorance Nicholas accuses Stone of being a typical Brit with no regard for Africa and that he's sure there is a perfectly reasonable explanation for those disappearances. Stone then tells Nicholas that the Health Minister is one of the disappeared. Panicked Nicholas goes to the Ministry of Health building only to find a different person is now the Health Minister. Nicholas knows it is his fault the Health Minister is likely dead even as he delivers the ""official statement"" that the Heath Minister has fled the country for embezzling funds and is a suspected Obete supporter. Nicholas soon learns that the Health Minister was securing a supply of medicine from the white man in Holiday Inn lounge.It is raining heavily late at night and Nicholas is floating in the pool alone distressed and upset. Nicholas goes to see Amin to announce he is going home. Amin turns around and it's actually a body double in Amin's uniform. The real Amin and his goons jump out of the shadows laughing and teasing Nicholas. Amin keeps saying ""I caught you I caught you"" in a childish manner. There are several body doubles in the room and Amin asks Nicholas if the body doubles are more handsome than him. Nicholas of course says no and Amin taunts one of the body doubles that he is ugly. This is another example of Amin insulting his underlings.After sending his body doubles and goons out of the room Amin turns serious and tells Nicholas that he cannot go back to Scotland Uganda is his home now and he is like to a son to Amin. Nicholas begs that he is way over his head especially after the Health Minister affair. Amin scolds Nicholas for his naivety (""nothing can come from nothing"") arrogance and his white man's attitude toward Africa. Amin then embraces him.Amin throws a party with go-go girls to cheer Nicholas up even featuring himself as an Uganda cowboy. This doesn't help as Nicholas still looks very unhappy and downs drink after drink. He runs away from a go-go girl assigned to him and straight into Kay's arms. They end up having sex in a room while the party is still going outside. Kay warns Nicholas that Amin has always been this way and only now shows his true character to Nicholas. She tells him needs to find a way to get out of Uganda. Nicholas still tries to rationalize that things aren't really that bad. Nicholas and Kay return to the party to find it dispirited now that Amin is playing a melancholy tune on the accordion in a trance-like state. This is one of many examples of Amin's quicksilver temperament.Nicholas returns to his apartment after the party only to find it in completely ransacked. He finds an envelope and upon opening it finds a Ugandan passport with his picture. His Scottish passport gone Nicholas goes to see Stone who shows him gruesome pictures of murdered people suspected of being Obete's supporters even entire tribes have been wiped out. Stone saves the best for last a picture of the dead Health Minister. Stricken Nicholas pleads for help to get out of Uganda but Stone says he has to ""earn his passage"" by killing Amin now that the British can no longer control him. Nicholas learns that he has been called ""Amin's white monkey"" by others.Trapped without friend or allies Nicholas and Kay continue to find comfort with one another.Amin grows increasingly unpredictable and Nicholas's hospital is filled with refugees and victims of Amin's regime. His latest crazy scheme is to kick all Asians out of Uganda within 90 days calling them leeches. This is part of Amin's plan for an all-black African country. Nicholas arrives at the hospital to find it in total chaos as Amin's goons are trying to expel Asian patients. Goon#1 is beating up Junju and Nicholas stops him and demands that the goons leave the hospital. The goons leave but not before goon#1 gives Nicholas an especially evil glare.Nicholas goes to Amin and tells him he cannot expel the Asians as they have lived in Uganda for generations and only they have the ability to run the infrastructure of the country. Uganda's economy will be severely crippled if Amin carries out this mad plan. Amin doesn't believe Nicholas and angrily dismisses him as ""nothing but a doctor - a nobody"".Kay calls Nicholas in a panic that Amin is ""going to kill us."" She is pregnant. Kay threatens to go to a village witch doctor and Nicholas begs her not to that he will somehow arrange the abortion in a clinical setting and that they will do it first thing in the morning. The following morning Nicholas tells Junju what has happened and he understandably freaks out and refuses to have the abortion done in the hospital as Amin is sure to find out and kill any doctors performing the abortion. Nicholas decides he will have to do it himself and raids the medical supply room for the necessary operation when goon #1 interrupts him and said Amin wants to see him right away.Amin is in hysterics furious over international newspapers labelling him a madman and a cannibal. He screams that ""these are all lies!"" and threatens to throw all foreign journalists out of Uganda. He starts in on Nicholas and angrily demands to know why Nicholas did not warn him not to throw the Asians out of Uganda. Nicholas furiously protests that he did precisely this and Amin throws back ""Ah but you did not persuade me!""Cornered Nicholas advises Amin not to throw the journalists out of Uganda but instead invite them where he can turn on the charm. Amin calms down and happily coos ""what will I do without my Nicholas."" But Nicholas only looks frightened and Amin asks if there is anything else. Nicholas says no. Amin grabs Nicholas by the face and asks again. Nicholas losing courage still says no. Amin lets go of him and says he has to stay for the press conference.By now we realise the two men's relationship is something of a bizarre love affair an on-then-off again romance with the heart of darkness. The irony is Nicholas left Scotland to escape a controlling father figure only to be captivated by another and has gone from the frying pan into the inferno.At the press conference Amin turns on his charm for the media to distract them and the world from what he's really doing. It works as nearly all the foolish journalists nod their heads in agreement with Amin's ridiculous explanations. Not surprising as many of history's great villains were charismatic enough to get people to go along with their actions. In this conference we find out why Amin calls himself the Last King of Scotland. He sees in Scottish devolutionary ambition a parallel to Africa's own struggle against the English and announces since he has successfully defeated the British he will do the same for Scotland and hence he will be their king.After the press conference Nicholas drives like a bat out of hell to Kay's house only to find weeping servants telling him Kay has already gone to the witch doctor and now has been taken to the hospital due to complications from the back-alley abortion. Nicholas rushes to the hospital only to hear creepy wailings. Following the noise he finds series of crying people in the hallway some appear to have gone insane. Going down to the basement he finds hordes of distressed people and goon#1 telling them this is what happens to those who betray Amin. Entering the morgue he finds Kay's dismembered body. Her legs have been sewn on in place of her arms and her arms in place of her legs.. Her son is in the same room. Nicholas cries over Kay's body and vomits.Nicholas goes to see Amin who is watching porn with his goons. He gloomily tells Nicholas that he did it to make an example of Kay because she betrayed him. Nicholas gives Amin a bottle of pills for his ""headache"" and rushes out. Outside he is stopped by the guards and brought back inside where Amin is gleeful and jovial and teases Nicholas for ""running away from me"". He tells Nicholas that Palestinian terrorists have hijacked an Air France plane and he has allowed them to land in Uganda. Amin feels this is an opportunity to both help his ""Palestinian brothers"" and show the world what a great leader he is.While riding to the airport with Amin and the goons Nicholas nervously eyes the bottle of headache pills still in Amin's hands indicating that the pills are actually poison. Amin Nicholas and the goons arrive at Entebbe airport where Amin assures the news media that the hostages will be looked after and sends in Nicholas. Nicholas notices that goon #1 now has Amin's bottle of pills but he can do nothing about it. Nicholas meets Junju and the nurses that are giving malaria pills to the hostages. While treating the hostages for shock Nicholas sees goon #1 going outside with the pills. Nicholas follows and sees goon #1 force a child solider to take the pill. Before the boy could swallow the pill Nicholas runs out and makes the boy spit out the pill.In the next scene the goons are dragging a badly beaten Nicholas in front of the horrified hostages to a shop out of sight from others. Amin tells Nicholas that he knows about the affair with Kay and tells him a story of a practice done in his village to purge a man of evil by hanging him by his skin. Every time the man screams a bit of evil is released. Amin tells Nicholas that he has ""grossly offended your father."" Nicholas reaches up to touch Amin and whispers ""You're a child. That's what makes you so scary.""The goons bring ropes and 2 hooks. Holding Nicholas up they proceed to pierce his chest with the hooks while Nicholas is looking straight into Amin's eyes refusing to scream. Nicholas is strung up and hangs from the ceiling by his skin (a couple of people in the movie theater passed out watching this scene). He never screams and appears to have died. Amin watches looking genuinely sad and sheds a tear. Amin goes outside and his public persona immediately returns smiling charmingly for the cameras. He announces that Israel is willing to negotiate and he has made arrangements for the non-Israel citizens to be safety transported away by plane.The goons take down Nicholas's body and proceed to the basement to unwind with cards and alcohol leaving the body on the floor of the shop. Junju sneaks in gives Nicholas a shot (probably adrenaline) to wake him up bandage up his body and face and wipe off as much blood as he can. Junju tells Nicholas that while he may deserve to die he is useless dead. Junju plans to have Nicholas escape with the non-Israelii hostages to a plane and tell the world the truth about Amin after all they would believe him since he is a white man. Junju gives Nicholas his blazer to better disguise him and pushes him out the door just as the hostages walking to the plane pass by. The hostages help him walk to the plane and comfort him once they are safely on board.The goons return and discover the body gone and go tearing through the airport looking for him. They find Junju trying to leave the airport and suspect that he has something do with the missing doctor. They take Junju back to the shop and shoot him in the head. The goons interrupt Amin's press interview where he has just explained that he has broken off relations with Israel. The plane is safely in the air and Amin watches it fly away.Knowing that he is finally truly out of Uganda Nicholas lets himself pass out.Epilogue reveals that 48 hours later the Israeli military force made a daring raid on the Entebbe airport and rescued all the hostages except one that died.World opinion permanently turned against Amin.(Personal note: Ugandans saw the Israeli's successful rescue of the Entebbe hostages as a sign of Amin's weakness and this was the turning point on Amin's hold on his power)Amin was overthrown for good in 1979. He died in 2003 while living in exile in Saudi Arabia. He is responsible for 300000 deaths in Uganda.The movie shows actual documentation reels of Idi Amin including a scene of a Ugandan marching army dressed entirely in Scottish garb."
Based on the events of the brutal Ugandan dictator Idi Amin's regime as seen by his personal physician during the 1970s.
In the early 1970s Nicholas Garrigan a young semi-idealistic Scottish doctor comes to Uganda to assist in a rural hospital. Once there he soon meets up with the new President Idi Amin who promises a golden age for the African nation. Garrigan hits it off immediately with the rabid Scotland fan who soon offers him a senior position in the national health department and becomes one of Amin's closest advisers. However as the years pass Garrigan cannot help but notice Amin's increasingly erratic behavior that grows beyond a legitimate fear of assassination into a murderous insanity that is driving Uganda into bloody ruin. Realizing his dire situation with the lunatic leader unwilling to let him go home Garrigan must make some crucial decisions that could mean his death if the despot finds out.::Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com)

As a writer who like Charles Dickens saw no part of society unworthy of his attention and scrutiny Emile Zola (Paul Muni) gradually rises through his novels as a moralist who semes to understand empathize with and appreciate people in all stations in life. His fame and credibility as a champion of the people give him the courage to intervene in the notorious Dreyfus affair in which Alfred Dreyfus a Jewish officer in the French army is despite the lack of evidence against him found guilty of the treasonous acts of another Army officer and exiled to Devil's Island. Within a year of Dreyfus' arrest it becomes clear to several in the French army that Dreyfus was innocent but they resolve to sweep the mistake under the rug rather than rectify it.When it later becomes evident to Zola that the Dreyfus affair is a coverup the resolution of which might impugn the honor of the French army he realizes that he won't have an easy time exposing the truth but he tries. He is incensed when the real perpetrator Esterhazy is found innocent in a rigged court martial hearing. Disenchanted Zola risks his career and fame by writing a letter to the President of France and has it published in a major newspaper. The article called J'Accuse is a direct accusation of the French army in covering up the innocence of Dreyfus to protect one of its own and the result of this unpopular letter is the arrest of Zola on a libel charge. To the army's dismay the court proceedings against him give Zola an even greater platform from which to publicly expose the weakness of the case against Dreyfus.In the courtroom the army has little choice but to try to bully and discredit the popular Zola and causes him to be shunned by many even in the country in which he is a revered novelist and moralist. Rather than remaining in France after his conviction Zola sees it fit to flee to England his courage and conviction in uncovering the truth unimpaired. The Dreyfus case is ultimately reopened and Dreyfus is offered a pardon which he accepts. Dreyfus is set free and promoted in the French army and Zola can now return to French soil his actions vindicated by the pardon.Sadly Zola dies before the French court fully exonerates Dreyfus but his valiant fight in the Dreyfus affair only added to his reputation of one of France's greatest men. Zola's courageous and zealous pursuit of the truth in his novels and in his life make him a symbol of morality and integrity for the ages.
The biopic of the famous French muckraking writer and his involvement in fighting the injustice of the Dreyfuss Affair.::Kenneth Chisholm
Fictionalized account of the life of famed French author Emile Zola. As portrayed in the film he was a penniless writer sharing an apartment in Paris with painter Paul Cezanne when he finally wrote a best-seller Nana. He has always had difficulty holding onto a job as he is quite outspoken being warned on several occasions by the public prosecutor that he risks charges if he does not temper his writings. The bulk of the film deals with his involvement in the case of Captain Alfred Dreyfus who was falsely convicted of giving secret military information to the Germans and sentenced to life imprisonment on Devils Island. Antisemitism played an important role in the real-life case but is hardly mentioned in the film. Even after the military found definitive evidence that Dreyfus was innocent the army decided to cover it up rather than face the scandal of having arbitrarily convicted the wrong man. Zola's famous letter J'Accuse (I Accuse) led to his own trial for libel where he was found guilty and forced to flee to England. Dreyfus was eventually exonerated and restored to his military rank.::garykmcd
The story of Emile Zola French writer and social commentator. We track his life from his days as a struggling artist sharing an apartment with Paul Cezanne to his first bestselling book and resulting elevation from poverty to his forays into social and political commentary through his books to his involvement in the Dreyfuss Affair.::grantss
Paul Cezanne and Émile Zola were friends when both were starting their careers. Through ups and downs Zola became financially successful long before Cezanne. He was married and had a successful career as an author. Paul Cezanne then decided to live in the country far away from the city and told Zola not to be part of the establishment but to fight for truth and justice again. He is approached by Lucie Dreyfus who's husband was unjustly court martialed and sent to Devil's Island because he was accused of betraying his country by disclosing military secrets.::Rosemea D.S. MacPherson
Struggling French writer Émile Zola is more concerned about exposing social and public injustices through his writing than he is about earning a living. However he does ultimately become a success as a writer and as a result lives a life of comfort and class. Late in his life he on the most part places his life as a social crusader behind him. Late in the nineteenth century French Captain Alfred Dreyfus adamantly professing his innocence is accused tried and convicted of treason against the French republic and banished to Devil's Island. New information comes to light of Dreyfus' innocence information suppressed by the French military in the name of protecting public morale and information which is brought to Zola's attention by Mme. Dreyfus. Initially not wanting to get involved Zola decides to reignite his social consciousness by defending Dreyfus in the court of public opinion at the risk of his own personal standing and safety.::Huggo

They kiss and seem to be about to have sex but she stops him. He has plans to study Medicine and Esther worries that in his plans there is no education for her. He says that she may go to college as well and goes back to the topic of what will happen when he will have his practice. She inquires about his previous love affairs - he has had several a waitress another woman. He says that for a guy it is different and sex may not always lead to have an emotional attachment. He assumes that she is still a virgin and she finds it offensive. She finally admits that she has never sex with any man; this secretly relieves and satisfies him. He asks whether she has ever seen a naked man and she says she hasn't. He asks her whether she would like to see one - referring to himself of course. She finally says she is interested in doing that. He starts to undress while she munches on something. She laughs when she sees him on his undies.

"The film opens with a carnival in Venice as a prelude to a series of erotic encounters that follow Giacomo Casanova through the cities of 18th-century Europe. The organizers of the festival attempt to raise a gigantic bust from the water; this fails which is taken as a bad omen. Casanova is then introduced as he visits one of Venice's islands to copulate with a fake nun for the pleasure of a rich voyeur; Casanova succeeds in entertaining him but is frustrated that the man finds no interest in his research into alchemy and his further scheming. As he rows back to the mainland Casanova is arrested judged and imprisoned by the High Court over his famed debauchery. During his time in prison Casanova reminisces of his affairs with a dressmaker and later on with one of her junior employees Anna Maria who suffers from frequent fainting and requires constant bloodletting. He eventually consummates his desire for Anna Maria. Back in prison Casanova escapes through the roof and exiles himself from Venice being taken into the Paris court of Madame d'Urfé. The Madame an aged woman enthralled by Casanova's apparent knowledge of alchemy wishes to transform her soul into a man's through ritualistic intercourse with him (an act that requires the presence of a younger woman in the room so that Casanova can get aroused). Fortuitously Casanova encounters his brother whose girlfriend he entices away. Casanova then moves to the court of a hunchback Du Bois in between taking charge of a beautiful girl-""the love of his life""-Henriette. Du Bois puts on a homosexual theatrical performance for his guests that unsettles some of them; Casanova is brought to tears as Henriette plays some music. The lovers vow fidelity to each other but the following morning Henriette has disappeared. Du Bois informs Casanova that an emissary of a far-away court has reclaimed Henriette and she's left a request that Casanova not attempt to follow her. While in London Casanova is robbed by two women and he attempts suicide by drowning himself in the Thames. A vision of a giantess and two dwarfs distracts him; he follows them to a frost fair where he arm-wrestles the giantess-a princess-and later pays to watch her bathe with the dwarfs. Casanova resumes his travelling the following day. He attends a deranged party at Lord Talou's palace in Rome where he wins a bet with a stagecoach driver Righetto over how many orgasms he can have in one hour. The competition brings him higher acclaim. In Switzerland he falls in love with an alchemist's daughter Isabella who fails to keep an appointment to go to Dresden with him; Casanova instead partakes in an orgy within the hostel he's been stranded in. In Dresden he has a brief chance encounter with his estranged mother in a theater. He then moves to a court in Württemberg where his desire to be taken seriously as a writer/inventor is frustrated by the court's orgiastic wild nature. It is here that he meets Rosalba a mechanical doll with whom he shares a dance and later on goes to bed with. Time goes by and an old Casanova finds himself librarian to Count Waldstein at his castle in Dux. Life at the castle is more than frustrating for Casanova as he is made to eat with other servants and does not get the respect nor the food he claims to deserve. Waldstein's manservant Faulkircher and his lover Vidarol make him an object of mockery and animosity. A portrait of him is hanged and defecated on. Later on during a fervent poetry recital a court member fails to suppress a giggle at Casanova who humiliated and disappointed goes back up to his room. The final scene has a weary bloodshot Casanova cringing in an armchair and recounting a recent dream. In this dream Casanova is back in Venice. He catches a glimpse of the giant bust seen in the beginning of the film buried under thick layers of ice in the lagoon. He chases the ghosts of his past lovers all of whom disappear. An ornate stagecoach beckons him to join its passengers. He finally meets with Rosalba the mechanical doll once again. They quietly dance with each other."

"November 13 1959.Perry Smith (Robert Blake) a dwarfish dreamy soft-spoken man of Cherokee Indian and Dutch descent has been paroled from prison for the past few months. He's on a Greyhound Bus drifting from an unknown location to Kansas City Missouri and strumming his guitar. A little girl is fascinated by his strumming but after he spots her she walks away. He is to meet up with an old prison buddy Willie Jay. But he's also expecting to meet with Dick Hickock (Scott Wilson) another former prison buddy from the local area that had written him a letter about a ""perfect score"" they could make in western Kansas and that he will meet him at the bus terminal.Dick Hickock is a charming young man from a simple farm family that own a small tract of land and live just outside of Olathe Kansas a suburb of Kansas City. His father is ill and dying of cancer. He informs his father that is coughing badly outside the outhouse that he will get them a better place. With his rifle in the backseat of his 1949 Chevrolet he is ready to pick up Perry and begin his journey.At the Greyhound terminal in Kansas City Perry phones the prison chaplain Reverend James Post (Sheldon Allman) inquiring about his friend Willie Jay. Perry is upset that he has not yet been released from prison and the chaplain warns him not to set foot into Kansas since his parole has a condition that he is not to do so.Out in western Kansas in the town of Holcomb near Garden City we are introduced of a prosperous farmer by the name of Herbert Clutter (John McLiam) and his family. He is a healthy vigorous kindly yet straitlaced man of 48 years of age that has never used tobacco alcohol or caffeine in his life and having a glass of milk for breakfast. His beautiful and sweet 16-year-old daughter gives him a morning kiss informing him of her busy day ahead and he finds his 15-year-old son Kenyon down in the basement who is sneaking a smoke and painting a box for his older sister's wedding. Herbert smells the smoke and pretends he doesn't know Kenyon is doing it but knows and dismisses it. Herbert's wife Bonnie is an ailing and frail woman suffering psychosomatic illness and bedridden much of the time.Back at the Kansas City bus terminal Perry is in the washroom treating his badly scarred knee that he got years ago from a motorcycle accident. Afterwards he looks in the mirror and imagines himself performing in Las Vegas in a nightclub with empty chairs but then Dick notices him and gets him out of his trance. They leave the terminal.Dick and Perry are on Interstate 670 entering Kansas. Perry has now broken parole entering Kansas. Dick informs him of the ""perfect score"" about a rich farmer in western Kansas named Herbert Clutter that he was tipped off on by a former prison buddy Floyd Wells. He was told that Clutter had a safe with probably $10000 in it and that they could rob it and leave no witnesses killing everybody in sight. We get to know these two people Perry a quiet introspective dreamy but mentally unstable young man and Dick less intellectual but more masculine and practical. Dick assures Perry that it was okay he didn't meet up with Willie Jay because he is ""a flaming faggot"".On November 14 after driving all night Perry and Dick stop at a hardware store in Emporia purchasing duct tape rubber gloves and nylon rope for their victims. At the checkout stand Dick steals a package of razor blades. They regret not having purchased nylon stockings (so they can use to put over their heads to disguise their faces) but Perry said maybe they could go to a Catholic church and get them after seeing nuns. Dick jokes and says ""yeah we'll just go barge in like it was a five and dime store"".During the long trip we simultaneously see the everyday life of the Clutter family and Perry and Dick traveling. Herbert is writing a check to an insurance salesman for $40000 in case anything happens to him and they have a television repairman come. Perry and Dick stop at a hamburger stand Perry dreams of his childhood growing up with his Dutch father and Cherokee mother having rodeos all over the southwest and they arrive in Garden City and stop at a Fina gas station to refuel. Perry is in the washroom gobbling aspirin and wincing from the pain in his leg and Dick steals some snacks at the counter while his car is being fueled. The Clutter family is about to go to bed and soon afterwards Perry and Dick arrive at the Clutter house in Holcomb. Perry said they should split and not do this but Dick talks him into it. They are both slightly drunk.The next morning (November 15) a friend of Nancy's and her parents are repeatedly ringing the doorbell at the Clutter home but nobody answers. They cautiously enter the home. The girls father finds a severed phone cord and the girl is screaming. Afterwards police cars and ambulances arrive at the Clutter home to take away the bodies. The postmistress Sadie Truitt is surprised at what's going on.Perry is asleep at a hotel in Olathe and Dick is at his parents modest home eating. He asks his father what happened to the basketball game and told it got interrupted because of a murder that happened in Garden City that's on the news. Dick jokes and declares he's never been so hungry in his life.FBI Agent Alvin Dewey (John Forsythe) has been in charge of the case and is a local resident. He and another agent Roy Church (John Gallaudet) have been dispatched to investigate the scene. They are trying to recover fingerprints and Dewey can't find a clue as to why they have been robbed because Herbert Clutter never kept large sums of cash on him and did everything by check. They are later at the courthouse in Garden City seeing a slide show of bloody footprints seen of two different kinds of shoes and Dewey informs the men that the press do not get the information. After reviewing the slideshow Dewey insists he will give only facts mainly that Herbert Clutter's throat was cut and that the women were not molested. He meets up with a stern but friendly and easygoing reporter named Bill Jensen (Paul Stewart) ( supposedly based on the writer Truman Capote). They converse alone in the courtroom and can't figure out the case but Dewey informs him the two older daughters will get the insurance even though it was written the same night of the murder. Agent Church is at the Clutter home with the housekeeper and she discovers that Kenyon's radio is missing.Back at the Olathe Hotel Perry and Dick are listening to the investigation on Kenyon's radio. Perry is disgusted that Dick's prison buddy Floyd Wells lied to him about the money and feels that the story is not true about no clues as to who did the crime. Dick tells him to quit worrying even though he's a witness.Prisoner Floyd Wells hears the report of the Clutter murders on the radio and is surprised at the $1000r reward for anybody that has any clue of them. But still the agents have no clue of it. Yet somehow they knew that over $40 in cash was stolen.Meanwhile about two days later Perry and Dick are shopping in Kansas City Kansas. Dick plans to write a lot of bad checks for a fitted suit for Perry whom he says is about to get married an expensive ring camera and a television set. Afterwards they leave and are on their way to Mexico to never come back hoping to score there.Over the next few weeks the investigation continues with men dragging a river near the Clutter home to search for the murder weapon. No success. Dewey and Agent Clarence Duntz go back to the Clutter home and find a man staying there they believe to be a suspect but instead he turns out to be an escaped mental patient occupying the place.Dewey and Bill Jensen meet at Hartman's Cafe a small restaurant in Holcomb managed by Bess Hartman a sassy no-nonsense woman. Dewey receives an immediate phone call there from Harold Nye another agent assigned to the case with a phone call from Lansing Kansas from Logan Sanford head of Kansas Bureau of Investigation. There is a confession from Floyd Wells Dick Hickcok's former cellmate about Floyd being a former hired man for Clutter and how he told Dick about Clutter's place and all the money and a safe that he had and that Dick wanted to rob the place. He explains how Dick was obsessed with the Clutter home but never took him seriously. Sanford insists on a pickup for parole violation for Hickock and that he's also wanted for passing hot checks.Perry and Dick cross the border from Laredo Texas into Mexico believing they are now safe and sound and off to live the good life.Somewhere in Nevada in an auto junkyard with a decrepit trailer Agents Dewey and Church meet with Tex Smith (Charles McGraw) a man nicknamed ""The Lone Wolf"" a reclusive eccentric yet courteous 60-ish man that is the father of Perry. They inquire of Perry's whereabouts and if he's seen him but he says he has not seen Perry since his stint in prison but they do the math and realize he hasn't seen Perry in years. Smith does most of the talking about Perry's background that he feels he learned his lesson and always taught his kids to be truthful enterprising sober and independent but that his wife that was a Cherokee Indian that took to drunkenness sleeping with young men and the kids living with that and that he put a stop to it. Also telling them of the story when Perry joined him in Alaska after getting out of the Army to prospect gold and building a lodge. The agents find the interview pointless in getting Perry captured and leave.Meanwhile Perry and Dick are living in a decrepit motel somewhere in Mexico. Perry believes that if they sell the car and buy some deep sea diving gear they can get the buried treasures in the Yucatan Peninsula to get the Cortez jackpot. However Dick being practical and realistic tells Perry to forget about it and that he's selling his car for $120 to pay their hotel bill bar food and get a bus ticket to Barstow California. Much to Perry's extreme disappointment Dick tells him to knock it off stop dreaming and that it's all made up.Dewey and Bill Jensen are back at the Clutter home still trying to find out the motive of the murders. Even with a newspaper article written about how such an incident could happen months before they still can't figure it out. But Dewey insists that once they are found they'll hang.In Mexico Dick is enjoying himself at the hotel with a prostitute while Perry is packing his belongings. Perry takes a glimpse of the prostitute and she reminds him of his own mother. He has flashbacks of his mother sleeping with a younger man and drunk while he and his siblings look on. His father catches his mother in the act throwing the man out slapping her bare back with a belt and pouring her alcohol all over her back. It's made evident Perry had a very traumatic and unhappy childhood despite his love and devotion for both of his parents and siblings.Another weeks or so later in mid December 1959 Perry and Dick are somewhere in the California desert hitching a ride. Dick comes up with a plan that Perry sit in the backseat and when Dick asks him to pass him a match Perry take his belt to garrote the driver and rob him. An elderly man in a jeep stops but then drives away and changes his mind. Then an African American man (Rosey Grier; a black football star of the Los Angeles Rams) and a friend of his offer them a ride in his pink Cadillac but they refuse (aware that the two ""negros"" will intend to rob them). They end up taking a ride with a traveling salesman they form a friendly relationship with. Dick asks Perry to pass him a match but just as Perry is about to garrote the salesman the man stops the car to pick up a soldier hitchhiking for Christmas.Agent Harold Nye is at the homestead of Walter Hickock father of Dick and discovers a 12 gauge shotgun he suspects is the murder weapon. Mr. Hickock tells the man he can't understand how Dick would ever commit such a crime and tells the detective about Dick's history that he's still a good man despite what has happened but the detective seems disinterested at the testimony and takes the weapon.Perry and Dick end up at a barn in a farmhouse somewhere in Iowa and discover a Pontiac convertible with the keys in it and steal the car. Afterwards they decide to pass a lot of bad checks in Kansas City and swap license plates to avoid detection. Agent Duntz is in Kansas City and got a report of them buying two tires with a bad check at an auto parts store from a worried clerk and tells Dewey about it. They intend to meet Perry and Dick at the Hickock farm. Duntz is going to meet them at the Hickock farm. Perry and Dick are just about to cross into Kansas through a toll booth but detect a police car. Perry turns the steering wheel around and he and Dick and go back before approaching the toll booth.Back in Garden City Alvin Dewey is studying a map of Kansas about their possible travel route then telephoned that Perry and Dick have eluded detection. He can't figure out why they came back to Kansas otherwise.December 30 1959.Somewhere in the desert southwest Perry and Dick pick up a boy and his grandfather. Dick is reluctant but Perry insists on doing it. They go through it and the boy tells them if they pick up a bunch of old soda bottles they can make some money. They end up picking up numerous bottles. By the time they drop off the boy and his grandfather in Las Vegas they make over six dollars from it. Perry and Dick are in good spirits and want to gamble the five dollars. Perry picks up his belongings from the local post office he has picked up from Mexico. Before they can go to the casinos they are pulled over and arrested by local police.Perry and Dick are in the Las Vegas jail and informed they have visitors. Church and Nye are interviewing Hickock and Dewey and Duntz and interviewing Smith. They are initially believed to think they are being charged with passing a series of hot checks and driving a stolen vehicle but subconsciously realize they are being investigated about the Clutter murders. Both of them are in separate interrogation rooms making up a story that Perry was to go to Fort Scott to get money from his sister but it turned out she moved then they slept with a couple of prostitutes in Kansas City that they don't remember the names of. After Dick is inquired about the Clutter murder case he flies off the handle. But they know Dick is lying about going to Fort Scott because Perry's sister never lived there and the post office is closed Saturday. Perry is told directly by Duntz directly he killed the Clutter family that day. Dick feels they are putting him on but after they show him proof of the footprints he spills the beans and admits Perry did all the killing. Dick faints afterwards.The next day Perry and Dick are taken from the Las Vegas jail to Garden City Kansas. Perry tells Alvin Dewey the story of what happened that night......In a long flashback to the early morning hours of November 15 Perry and Dick reluctantly entered the house and did not find the safe took Herbert Clutter and his son Kenyon down to the basement with Nancy and the mother upstairs tied up. After a lot of frustration and finding only a small sum of cash Perry's legs are hurting him and he has a flashback of his father pulling a gun on him saying ""I'm the last living thing you're ever going to see"". He cut Herbert Clutter's throat then shot him then Kenyon Bonnie and Nancy Clutter. Perry concludes that his murder of the Clutter's was not personal he just did it and thought Herbert Clutter was a very nice man.The next day they arrive in Garden City Kansas at the courthouse and both are jailed. Sometime later (in March 1960) their court case is presented by the prosecutor (Will Geer) as a motive simply for money and that they need the death penalty because life imprisonment would mean possible parole in seven years. He also quotes The Ten Commandments ""Thou Shalt Not Kill"". Both Perry and Dick are found guilty of murder and under state Kansas law (at that time) carries a mandatory death sentence by hanging.Perry and Dick are taken to Lansing Kansas to the death row section. They spend the next five years there living a mundane life of isolation from the other prison inmates entirely of sitting in their cell with a weekly shower and only reading and writing material to keep themselves occupied outside their own thoughts. Bill Jensen narrates about the mundane life on death row before execution and that neither one of them would have ever done the crime alone but together they formed a third personality which is the one that did it. Perry spends most of his time painting portraits and Dick doing research about his rights to not be executed. Three times their case went to the Supreme Court and all three of their appeals were rejected.After a little over five years of waiting Perry and Dick are executed by hanging on just after midnight on April 14 1965 at the gallows nearby. Dick is the first one and makes a final testimony that he has no hard feelings and is being taken to a better place. During Dick's execution Perry and Reverend James Post whom he talked to on the phone at the bus terminal is present. Perry tells the chaplain about the story of he and his father in Alaska prospecting and building a lodge but it was a complete failure and not a single client ever came and over time when food was running low Perry's father got cross and blamed him for being greedy when he was eating a biscuit. They got in a fight and he pulled a gun on Perry saying ""I'm the last living thing you're ever going to see"" from the vision he had before killing the Clutter's. Perry declares he hates his father but loves him as well.Dick has now died from hanging and his dead body is cut down. Bill Jensen declares to a young reporter that the executions are not solving anything except three families broken up and more speeches from politicians and everyone passing the buck over who is to blame for this crime; the criminals or society for rejecting them. Perry is brought over in a police car to be hanged. Right after being brought up to the gallows and before hanging he envisions the leathery and impersonal hangman looking like his father. The trap door opens and Perry is hanged."

"Laurens Iowa 1994. Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) is a 73-year-old frail old man who falls in his kitchen one day and waits for help from his slow-witted daughter Rose (Sissy Spacek). She takes him to a doctor from whom Alvin will heed no advice despite his many ailments (Alvin is a World War II veteran who is a diabetic and former alcoholic who continues to smoke cigars and is in the middle stages of emphysema). His only solution for his painful walking problems is to use two canes.One night during a raging thunderstorm Alvin gets news informing him that his 75-year-old estranged brother Lyle (Harry Dean Stanton) has suffered a stroke. The next day on the phone with a relative Rose says that Alvin and Lyle had a dispute ten years earlier and they have not spoken ever since.Determined to see his brother after all that time Alvin decides to visit him. The trouble is that Lyle lives 370 miles away in Mount Zion Wisconsin and Alvin is legally unable to drive a car due to his bad health and poor eyesight. To make matters worse Rose cannot drive either and no buses go to Mount Zion. Undaunted Alvin hatches a plan: he will drive his Rehd lawn mower all the way.Alvin gathers some supplies including a clapboard trailer that he hitches to the mower and prepares for his long journey. Rose is worried about him but the night before he departs he tells her to look up into the sky at the stars.Some of Alvin's old friends warn him on the way out of town that his journey is foolhardy but he continues on moving a few miles an hour for only a few hours until his tractor breaks down outside town. He and his tractor get towed back home where he promptly puts the Rehd rider out of its misery with a shotgun blast. Reunited with his daughter Alvin's determination knows no bounds. At the John Deere farm equipment dealer he purchases a newer replacement lawn tractor from a salesman (Everett McGill) who is generous but describes Alvin as being a smart man ""until now.""On September 5 Alvin sets off once more for Wisconsin. By day he travels on the road and at night he camps out in the fields off the road making a campfire for himself every night.The first person he meets along his route is a pregnant runaway hitchhiker (Anastasia Webb) to whom he offers some hot dogs and some inspiration after she explains that her parents would hate her for her condition. Alvin explains that his wife bore 14 children only 7 of whom lived and that Rose herself had 4 kids but they were taken away after a fire she was wrongly blamed for. He tells the girl that he used to ask his kids to each find a stick and try to break it which they could do easily; then he would ask them to each place a stick in a bundle and try to break it which they could not do. That bundle he says is family. The next morning the girl is gone having left behind a bundle of sticks.Alvin enjoys watching a rainstorm from the shelter of an abandoned farmhouse. The next scene shows Alvin as a huge group of RAGBRAI cyclists race past him. He later arrives at the cyclists' camp and he is greeted with applause. He speaks with them about growing old. When he is asked about the worst part of being old he replies ""remembering when you was young.""The next day Alvin is troubled by the massive trucks passing him. He then interacts with a distraught woman (Barbara E. Robertson) who has hit a deer and is being driven to distraction by the fact that she continually hits deer while commuting no matter how hard she tries to avoid them. She drives away in a tearful huff and Alvin who had started to run short of food cooks and eats the deer while an odd group of deer decoys looks on. Alvin then mounts the antlers above the rear doorway of his trailer as a tribute to the deer and the human sustenance it had provided.Five weeks into his trip as the landscape begins to undulate Alvin's trusty mower goes out of control and he speeds down a steep hill where a few people are gathered to watch the controlled burning of an abandoned house. A kindly middle-aged couple called the Riordans (James Cada Sally Wingert) welcome him to stay with them as he has his tractor fixed. Now beginning to run low on cash Alvin borrows a cordless phone from Mr. Riordan gently but resolutely refusing an invitation to come indoors and calls Rose to ask her to send him his Social Security check. He then leaves money on the doorstep to pay for his long-distance telephone call. A local motorist offers Alvin a ride the rest of the way to Lyle's but Alvin declines stating that he prefers to travel his own way. A local man about Alvin's age invites him to a bar (Alvin does not drink so he has milk). Alvin recalls his days in WWII when he returned from France as a heavy drinker until a preacher helped him. He explains that he drank so much because he kept seeing terrible things from war. The other man recalls how one night all of his buddies were blown up by Nazis in a tent while he was standing outside. Alvin recalls shooting one of his own men by accident and letting the rest of his men believe he was killed by a German sniper a secret he has not confessed since it happened.Alvin's tractor is fixed and he is presented with an exorbitant bill by the mechanics who are twins and are constantly bickering. Alvin successfully negotiates the price down and explains his mission which he calls ""a hard swallow to my pride"" but ""a brother is a brother."" The mechanic twins seem to relate to this realizing they should make peace.Alvin sets off again crossing the Mississippi River. Later Alvin camps in a cemetery and chats with a priest (John Lordan). The priest recognizes Lyle's name and is aware of his stroke. The priest says that Lyle did not mention he had a brother. Alvin replies that ""neither one of us has had a brother for quite some time."" Alvin wants to make peace with Lyle and is emphatic that whatever happened ten years ago does not matter anymore. ""I say 'Amen' to that brother"" the priest replies.The next day Alvin arrives in Mount Zion and stops at a bar where he orders a beer and drinks it... his first one in many years. He pays his tab and walk out.The next obstacle Alvin must overcome is apparent engine trouble just a few miles from Lyle's house. Alvin stops in the middle of the road unsure of how to proceed. A large farm tractor driving by then stops to help but fortunately this time the problem was evidently just a few drops of bad gas because the lawn-tractor's engine sputters to life again after sitting for a few minutes. The gracious farmer then leads the way on his own tractor and drives along slowly ahead of Alvin during the final leg of his journey to make sure he gets there okay.Lyle's house is dilapidated. Using his two canes Alvin makes his way to the door. He calls for his brother. At first Lyle does not appear and Alvin expresses relief when he does. The two brothers make contact Lyle with a walker and Alvin with two canes. Lyle invites Alvin to sit down. Lyle looks at Alvin's mower-tractor contraption and asks if Alvin has ridden that thing just to see him. Lyle is moved. The two men sit and look up at the sky at the stars as they had done as children.

John Hickam (Chris Cooper) the mine superintendent loves his job and hopes that his boys Jim (Scott Miles) and Homer (Jake Gyllenhaal) will one day join him in his mine. When it appears that Jim will receive a football scholarship to attend college this leaves Homer to fulfill his father's dream although his mother Elsie (Natalie Canerday) hopes for more for her son.In October news of the Soviet Union's rocket launch of Sputnik 1 reaches Coalwood. As the townspeople gather outside the night of the broadcast they see the satellite orbit across the sky. Filled with awe and a belief that this may be his chance out of Coalwood Homer sets out to build rockets of his own and enter the science fair. Initially his family and later his classmates think he has gone crazy and is wasting his time especially when he teams up with Quentin Wilson (Chris Owen) the school's math geek who also has an interest in rocket engineering. With the help of his friends Roy Lee Cooke (William Lee Scott) and Sherman O'Dell (Chad Lindberg) and support from their science teacher Miss Riley (Laura Dern) the four try out their new passion. While their first launches are failures they begin experimenting with new fuels and rocket designs. After several successful launches the local paper runs a story about them.The next day they are arrested accused of having started a forest fire with a rocket that had gone astray. After John picks up Homer from the police station Roy Lee is seen getting beat up by his stepfather Vernon. John intervenes and rescues Roy Lee warning the drunken man that even though Roy Lee's father is dead he will fight for Roy Lee as Roy Lee's father would have. In a rare display of emotion he tells Roy Lee that Roy's father was one of the best men who ever worked for him.The arrests along with John's lack of support crushes the boys' dream and they abandon rocketry.After a mine disaster John is injured while rescuing ""... a dozen men [who] would have died..."" though one other miner does die (Ike Bykovski). Homer drops out of high school and works the mine to provide for the family while his dad recovers.Later Homer is inspired to look at a rocket science book Miss Riley gave him and learns how to calculate the trajectory of a rocket. This reveals that an unrecovered rocket launched by the boys could not have caused the fire as it was unable to travel that far. Homer and Quentin calculate the precise distance of the missing rocket and find it in a stream. The boys present their findings to Miss Riley and the school principal Mr. Turner (Chris Ellis). Chagrined at the police Turner identifies the offending projectile as a flare from a nearby airfield.Homer returns to school the boys return to rocket making and soon win a school science fair. The school decides to send Homer to the national science fair in Indianapolis Indiana. That night John is almost shot by a man in a black car outside. John with Homer and Jim in tow exits the house to see who fired. John shouts ""Vernon!"" realizing this was apparently revenge for the threats John gave Roy Lee's stepfather earlier. Homer and Jim express their concern about this to their father but John passes it over bitterly telling Homer to go ""look for his suitcase"" (Homer had been doing so prior to the shooting). Fed up Homer confronts his father and a heated argument ensues. Homer storms out of the house vowing to never return or look back.At the national science fair Homer's display is received very well. Overnight someone steals his de Laval nozzle as well as his autographed picture of Wernher von Braun. Homer makes an urgent phone call home for help. Elsie implores John to end the ongoing strike so that Mr. Bolden can use the mine's machine shop to build a replacement nozzle. John initially refuses but relents when Elsie fed up with his lack of support for their son threatens that she will have to leave him. With the support of the town Homer wins the top prize and is besieged with scholarship offers from colleges. He is also congratulated by his inspiration Dr. von Braun but in the confusion does not realize the engineer's identity until after he is gone.Homer returns to Coalwood as a hero and visits Miss Riley who is now ill with Hodgkin's disease. He shows her the medal he has won and she responds touchingly. A launch of their largest rocket yet (called the Miss Riley) is the last scene of the film. (In the reality of which this scene is emblematic the rocket boys' most successful rocket reached an impressive altitude of 30000 feet (9100 m) higher than the summit of Mount Everest.) John finally shows up for a launch and is given the honor of pushing the firing button. As the rocket streams upward the film shows the view from the perspectives of many characters. As the group looks up to the rocket John slowly puts his hand on Homer's shoulder and smiles.A series of vignettes (including footage of a Space Shuttle launch and home movie footage of the characters in the 1950s) reveal the outcome of the main characters' lives."
