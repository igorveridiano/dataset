"The story is based loosely on real events and real people, drawing on David N. Thomas's book Dylan Thomas: A Farm, Two Mansions and a Bungalow.During the London blitz of World War II in 1940, nightclub singer Vera Phillips (Keira Knightley) runs into her first love, the charismatic Welsh poet Dylan Thomas (Matthew Rhys). Their feelings for each other are rekindled, despite the fact that Dylan is now married to and has a child with the spirited Caitlin MacNamara (Sienna Miller). In spite of their initial rivalry, the two women become best friends and, drinking heavily in wartime London, the three get along well.At this time, William Killick (Cillian Murphy), a British Army officer smitten with Vera, pursues her; both Vera and Caitlin are intrigued by his steadfast, gallant personality, although it contrasts with Vera's rebelliousness. William notices her closeness with Dylan, but doesn't seem particularly concerned by it; he and Vera even lend the struggling poet some of their savings. He and Vera fall in love and marry, but soon afterwards William is called up to join the fight against the 1941 German invasion of Greece.Vera discovers shortly after he leaves that she is pregnant; she's upset that motherhood will lose her independence, but cannot bring herself to abort William's child. She later gives birth to their son, and she and the Thomases move to the Welsh seashore to raise their children in two small neighbouring cottages, where Vera and Caitlin's friendship grows ever closer (almost intimate and romantic). One day, however, Dylan draws Vera into an affair. Dylan and Caitlin's marriage has long been distorted by their multiple infidelities, but Dylan (recalling a sexual encounter he and Vera had when she was 15 years old) sees her as his soulmate.William (now a Captain), scarred by the horrors of the war, eventually returns home where Vera notices his emotional distance and instability. In his disquiet, William comes to suspect his wife's infidelity and confronts her about it; Vera also confesses the truth to Caitlin, who is furious with her for lying to her. Severely drunk one evening, and angry with Dylan's friends and their ignorant remarks on the war, William wanders out at night and fires multiple shots into the Thomases' house, though he hits no one; Vera manages to talk him down, and the next morning he seems to return to his former self. However, he is soon arrested for attempted murder and taken to trial.During the trial, Dylan testifies against William by exaggerating the facts, stating he believed William was not only sober, but also that William intended to kill him, his wife, and his child. However, the jury finds William innocent of intent to murder, and he returns home. He accepts his new role as a father, and he and Vera forgive each other, rekindling their relationship. Soon afterwards, the Thomases move out of their cottage. During the farewell, Vera restores her friendship with Caitlin, but she never speaks with Dylan again, unable to forgive him for testifying against her husband."
"Two feisty, free-spirited women are connected by the brilliant, charismatic poet who loves them both.::Capitol Films"
"Two feisty, free-spirited women are connected by the brilliant, charismatic poet who loves them both. The passion and pathos of legendary poet Dylan Thomas is told through the lives of two extraordinary women. Vera Phillips and Dylan were teenage loves; fast forward ten years and the two reconnect in London. She's working as a singer whilst he's churning out scripts for government propaganda films and living off the last in a long line of infatuated women. The two former lovers feel the thunderbolt once more, but Thomas is now married to the adventurous Caitlin. Despite their love-rival status, the women form a surprising friendship. Caitlin indulges in her own infidelities, and recognises a similar adventurous spirit in her husband. But she knows his connection with Vera is something different, not to mention dangerous. Romantic turmoil continues in Vera's life. She marries her devoted admirer William Killick, but she can't deny the chemistry between herself and Dylan, nor does she want to - even if this means betraying Caitlin. When William is posted abroad, and a pregnant Vera returns to Wales with her married friends, the battle between her heart and head becomes more intense. William returns a changed man, but neither is Vera the carefree cabaret girl he married. Neighbourhood gossip fuels her husband's jealousy towards his rival. Enraged, William stages a violent attack on Dylan - an attack that forces Vera to choose between the men in her life and the friend that she loves. Desire and guilt are complicated by love and friendship in this real-life tale set in beautiful London and the majestic Welsh countryside.::paul@keiraweb.com"
A fictionalized account in four chapters of the life of celebrated Japanese writer Yukio Mishima.::Samovarkov
"A fictionalized account in four chapters of the life of celebrated Japanese author Yukio Mishima. Three of the segments parallel events in Mishima's life with his novels (The Temple of the Golden Pavilion, Kyoko's House, and Runaway Horses), while the fourth depicts the actual events of the 25th Nov. 1970, ""The Last Day"".::Nick Lopez <ntlopez@fas.harvard.edu>"
"The film sets in on November 25 1970, the last day in Mishima's life. He is shown finishing a manuscript. Then, he puts on a uniform he designed for himself and meets with four of his most loyal followers from his private army. In flashbacks highlighting episodes from his past life, the viewer sees Mishima's progression from a sickly young boy to one of Japan's most acclaimed writers of the post-war era (who keeps himself in perfect physical shape, owed to a narcissistic body cult). His loathing for the materialism of modern Japan has him turn towards an extremist traditionalism. He sets up his own private army and proclaims the reinstating of the emperor as head of state. The biographical sections are interwoven with short dramatizations of three of Mishima's novels: In The Temple of the Golden Pavilion, a stuttering aspirant sets fire to the famous Zen Buddhist temple because he feels inferior at the sight of its beauty. Kyoko's House depicts the sadomasochistic (and ultimately fatal) relationship between an elderly woman and her young lover, who is in financial debt. In Runaway Horses, a group of young fanatic nationalists fails to overthrow the government, with its leader subsequently committing suicide. Frame story, flashbacks and dramatizations are segmented into the four chapters of the film's title, named Beauty, Art, Action, and Harmony of Pen and Sword. The film culminates in Mishima and his followers taking hostage a General of the Japan Self-Defense Forces. He addresses the garrison's soldiers, asking them to join him in his struggle to reinstate the Emperor as the nation's sovereign. His speech is largely ignored and ridiculed."

"Based on the novel by Mika Waltari, Sinuhe the Egyptian, the film takes place during the reign on Akhnaton (around 1352 B.C.). The story, told in flashback, begins with an abandoned infant found in a reed basket on the Nile who is taken into the home of a talented physician, Senmut (Carl Benton Reid). Named Sinuhe, he grows into an idealistic young man. First he wants to become a soldier, but then his father talks him out of it, and Sinuhe undertakes studies to become a physician, just like his foster father.Sinuhe (Edmund Purdom) becomes best friends with the energetic and extroverted Horemheb (Victor Mature), who is training for the army at the same school run by the priests. Very different in character, the two friends go on an excursion hunting lions in the desert. They save the life of a strange lone man who they find worshiping a carved image of the sun. Unbeknownst to them, he is actually the new young Pharaoh Akhnaton (Michael Wilding), who is introducing a far less war-like type of rule into Egypt based on the worship of one god, the Aten.Akhnaton makes Sinuhe personal physician to the royal family and Horemheb a commander in his army. Enjoying the good life, Horemheb one night takes Sinuhe to the home of an infamous Babylonian courtesan Nefer (Bella Darvi), with whom Sinuhe becomes instantly infatuated. Nefer, however, only plays with men, and before too long, Sinuhe has sacrificed everything for her, only to be then cruelly rejected when she is tired of playing with him. Kaptah (Peter Ustinov) used to be a slave of Sinuhe's foster family, but he insisted in remaining with him, instead of going with Nefer. Kaptah and Sinuhe will remain in contact throughout the years, although they have a strange relationship based on equality; Kaptah will become a free man, a bar patron, and later, quite a rich merchant, with the help of Sinuhe, his initial investment, and his connections.Having neglected his duties, Sinuhe is a marked man and flees Egypt, spending many years in foreign countries practicing his medical genius. When he returns home, however, Egypt has slipped into serious trouble, as Akhnaton has lost the respect of the military, and his new religion is dividing the country. The fact that Queen Nefertiti (Anitra Stevens) has only been able to give birth to daughters is not helping either, but there may be other wives or a concubine who will finally succeed in having the heir the country needs so badly.Sinuhe finds Horemheb is plotting against the Pharaoh with the ambitious Princess Baketamon (Gene Tierney). In the rebellion that follows, Merit (Jean Simmons), who had always been a good friend of Sinuhe--and who may even be falling in love with him (and him with her)--is killed when Akhnaton's temple is sacked, and Sinuhe loses his young son Thoth (Tommy Rettig). When it is revealed he is actually the Pharoah's half brother, Sinuhe finally realizes how he has compromised all of his principles, and leaves to start a lonely existence on his own in the desert, bereft of family or love."

"The film opens at The Buddy Holly Hayride presented by radio station KDAV in Lubbock, Texas in 1956. During the opening credits, Holly (Charles Hardin Buddy Holley's last name was misspelled on his recording contract, so he simply adopted the misspelling as his last name) and his fellow band members (The Crickets' names were changed to avoid legal action from Jerry Allison and Joe B. Mauldin. The group's rhythm guitarist, Niki Sullivan, was ignored by the film, as was the groups manager, Norman Petty), drummer Jesse Charles (Don Stroud) and bass player Ray Bob Simmons (Charles Martin Smith), set up their music instruments and test their sound equipment at Parker's Roller Rink.As the radio station prepares to broadcast live, a recording of country artist Lefty Frizzell singing ""If You've Got the Money, Honey (I've Got the Time)"" is heard on the radio. Holly's first number is a cover version of Les Paul and Mary Ford's recording of ""Mockingbird Hill."" During a commercial break, some of the younger members of the audience beg Buddy to play some bop. After the commercial Buddy Holly (Gary Busey) announces they will be performing the next number for the boppers (""Rock Around with Ollie Vee""). The youngsters enjoy it, but the older audience members cover their ears from the loud tone and one of the radio station's sponsors demands that Buddy be taken off the air or he will pull his advertising. The station's owner/disk jockey, Riley Randolph (Bill Jordan), actually thinks they sound pretty good and he likes the response from the youngsters. So, the guys perform another of their numbers, ""That'll Be the Day.""The next scene is in a church where the choir is sings ""When the Roll Is Called Up Yonder."" Buddy, his girlfriend, Cindy or Cindy Lou (Amy Johnston), and his parents are in the congregation. The minister comments on what took place the previous night at the roller rink. He declares that this new ""jungle rhythm"" music is un-Christian and un-American. As the pastor's harangue against music that he considers a threat to society continues, Buddy and his parents drive home in their pick-up truck.During Sunday dinner, Buddy discloses that he has decided not to attend seminary. His mother feels she and his father have been more than patient about his decision and have even allowed him to sow his wild oats by playing his music, but they would like to know what he plans for his future. He readily admits he has no idea.Out on a date with Cindy, they listen to rhythm and blues music (""In the Still of the Nite"" by the Five Satins) on KWKH, a radio station from Shreveport, Louisiana. Some of his band buddies interrupt Buddy and Cindy's love making session to tell Buddy that Riley is looking for him.When Buddy goes to the radio station, Riley gives him some records by several R&B artists because he can't play them on his station. Riley calls the music ""rock and roll,"" a title that he says was devised by Cleveland DJ, Alan Freed. He also tells Buddy that a vice president of World Records heard the roller rink show and wants the band to come to Nashville.On the trip to Nashville, the car radio plays ""Lisbon Antigua"" by Nelson Riddle and His Orchestra. They quickly turn the dial to find a station that plays R&B, but, when they can't find one, they turn the radio off. In the back seat of the car, Buddy plays his guitar and works on a new song using his girlfriend's name (the song eventually becomes ""Peggy Sue"").In the Nashville recording studio, Buddy records ""That'll Be the Day"" in the hillbilly style that the record producer wants. Jesse and Ray Bob furnish the background vocals, but Jesse isn't allowed to play his drums (drums weren't permitted in country music at this time) and Ray Bob isn't allowed to play bass; instead, a country band accompanies them. When Buddy finally objects, the producer tells him there ""ain't no such thing as a hit record with just three guys playin' in any kind of music."" Since the record company refuses to listen to Buddy's objections, they pack up and head home.Back in Lubbock, Buddy is ready to hang it up. Riley has had more negative feedback about Buddy's radio show from his sponsors. He tells Buddy he must only play country music or he will be forced to fire him. Buddy is determined to play his music. Before he departs, Riley tells him he sent his tape to a record company in New York (Riley had recorded a couple of tunes from the roller rink show).In New York, Coral Records executive, Ross Turner (Conrad Janis) is considering signing Buddy and his band. When the company's A&R man heard the demo of ""That'll Be the Day,"" he assumed Ross had purchased the master from another label. He thought the group had the most unique sound he had heard in years, so he had it pressed and released. The A&R guy advises Ross that he had better sign them immediately because the disc is already selling.Back in Lubbock, Buddy, Jesse and Ray Bob record ""Everyday"" in his garage. Buddy is bothered by a sound that they eventually determine is being made by a cricket. Buddy asks Ray Bob to get a glockenspiel from the high school band to use on the recording. Buddy's mother interrupts the session to tell Buddy he has a long distance call from New York.A Buffalo, New York DJ, Madman Mancuso (Fred Travalena), telephones Buddy to tell him that he has been playing his hit recording of ""That'll Be the Day"" continuously for the past fourteen hours and intends to play it until he breaks the world's record. When Mancuso asks about the instrumentation of the band, Buddy explains that it is only a guitar, bass, drums and a cricket, so the DJ calls them Buddy Holly and the Crickets.At Coral Records in New York, Buddy is very impressed with Ross Turner's secretary, Maria Elena Santiago (Maria Richwine). The band members' interest in signing a recording contract is peaked when Mr. Turner tells them they should each make about $25,000 from ""That'll Be the Day."" However, when Turner mentions assigning a top notch producer for their recordings, Buddy balks. After their previous experience with the producer in Nashville, Buddy demands to be the producer. Turner tells him that no artist is allowed to be his own producer, but when Buddy and the guys threaten to go to another record company, Ross gives in to Buddy's demand.Buddy and the Crickets are booked for a concert at the Apollo Theater in Harlem. The short-sighted Sol Gitler (Dick O'Neill) had signed them sight-unseen and assumed from hearing their music that they were African-American. Even though no whites had ever performed at the Apollo, Gitler wasn't willing to pay them for doing nothing, so he apprehensively allows them to perform. As they prepare to go on in their country and western-looking duds, Sam Cooke (Paul Mooney) sings ""You Send Me"" from on stage. When Buddy and the Crickets are announced and the curtain opens to reveal a trio of white guys, the Apollo crowd grows restless. However, Buddy's songs, ""Oh, Boy!,"" ""It's So Easy,"" and ""Rave On,"" quickly win the crowd over. During ""Rave On"" several couples dance in the aisles. King Curtis (Craig White) and another African-American sax player join the Crickets during an instrumental break.During their next recording session, the guys record ""Words of Love."" Afterwards, Buddy overdubs another guitar and vocal part. When Maria comes into the recording booth, Buddy gets so flustered that he flubs his vocal. Buddy has been sending her roses, but when he asks her out, she reveals that her aunt, who works in the publishing department, will not allow her to date a musician or a non-Puerto Rican.Back in the recording studio, Buddy and the engineers listen to the final take of ""Listen to Me."" Buddy refuses to give up on Maria, so he goes to visit her aunt. He tells Mrs. Santiago (Gloria Irricari) that he is a music executive at Coral. Buddy impresses Maria's aunt by asking permission to court her niece. Once she grants her permission, Mrs. Santiago surprises Buddy by knowing who he really is and complimenting his performance on Dick Clark's TV show, 'American Bandstand'.On their very first date, Maria accepts Buddy's marriage proposal and they are soon married (although the film doesn't show the wedding). After Alan Freed moves to New York from Cleveland, Buddy and the Crickets perform on Freed's Moondog's Rock 'n' Roll Party along with Eddie Cochran (Jerry Zaremba). When the M.C. introduces Eddie, the crowd is still chanting for Buddy, so Eddie calls him back on stage to join him and his band in Jerry Lee Lewis' ""Whole Lotta Shakin Goin On."" Jesse and Ray Bob want to go back to Lubbock, but Buddy thinks they need to stay near the music business in New York City.Backstage while they're waiting to perform on the 'Ed Sullivan Show', both Jesse and Ray Bob have had too much to drink. They also get in a little fight and Buddy loses a cap off of one of his teeth, which he patches with some chewing gum. Once Sullivan announces them, they perform ""Maybe Baby."" Shortly after the Sullivan show performance, Ray Bob and Jesse return to Lubbock. All three agree that the name, the Crickets, will go with them, so Buddy becomes a solo act. Turner tells Buddy he needs to go on tour to promote his new identity and his new album, but Buddy doesnt want to tour.At Christmas 1958, a neighbor boy brings a guitar he had received as a present to Buddy because, he said, it was broke. After Buddy tunes the guitar, he teaches the boy to play some chords by playing and singing ""Well, All Right."" After the boy and his friend leave, Buddy admits to Maria that he is scared to go out on the road again without the Crickets. After admitting his fears, he decides to go on the tour even though Maria is now six months pregnant.On February 2, 1959 at the Clear Lake, Iowa stop on the Winter Party Tour, J.P. ""The Big Bopper"" Richardson (Gailard Sartain), a DJ from Beaumont, Texas, performs his hit, ""Chantilly Lace."" From backstage, Buddy calls Maria to check on her and her pregnancy. Shortly after she hangs up the telephone, Jesse and Ray Bob knock on her door. They want to rejoin Buddy, but they aren't sure he wants them back. After Maria reassures them that he would welcome their return, they decide to meet Buddy at the next stop on the tour.Back in Clear Lake, the Big Bopper introduces Buddy, who sings ""True Love Ways,"" which was inspired by something Maria said to him. He dedicates the song to Maria. After that slow ballad, Buddy performs a medley containing all of his songs: ""That'll Be the Day,"" ""Oh, Boy!,"" ""Peggy Sue,"" ""Maybe Baby,"" and ""Not Fade Away.""At the end of the medley, the screen freezes on a shot of Buddy and the following statement appears on the screen: ""Buddy Holly died later that night along with J.P. 'The Big Bopper' Richardson and Richie Valens in the crash of a private airplane just outside of Clear Lake... And the rest is rock 'n' roll."""

"The film opens in 1948. Young Ray Charles Robinson (Jamie Foxx), the blind son of a sharecropper, boards a bus at a rest stop in northern Florida. Ray lies to the racist bus driver about loosing his sight at Omaha Beach in 1944 during the war to get a free ride. He travels to Seattle, Washington where he uses his unexpected talent for the piano to get a job playing for a nightclub band. The club's owner (Denise Dowse) soon begins to exploit Ray, demanding sexual favors and controlling his money and career. After discovering that he is being lied to and stolen from, Ray leaves the band in disgust.In 1950, Ray joins a white country band who make him wear sunglasses to hide his damaged eyes from audiences. They go on tour, and Ray is introduced to heroin. He also suffers from traumatic flashbacks relating to his childhood. The elder of two brothers, Ray is raised by a fiercely independent single mother, Aretha Robinson (Sharon Warren). The family is poor, but young Ray finds solace in music. He learns to play the piano from a man at a local store. At age five, Ray is playing with his younger brother George in front of their house when George slips into their mother's full washbasin. Ray laughs at first, thinking George is goofing off, but becomes paralyzed with shock as his brother's limbs thrash violently in the soapy water, scrambling to escape. Aretha rushes to pull George from the water, but it is too late. Ray feels immense guilt over his brother's death, and begins to develop vision problems soon afterward. By age seven, he is completely blind. His mother teaches him to be independent despite his condition, and makes him swear that he will never let the world ""turn him into a cripple."" Eventually, she sends Ray to a school for the deaf and blind, weeping as her only remaining son boards a bus and disappears.As Ray travels on the road, he demands to be paid in single dollar bills so no one can cheat him (since he cannot see the paper notes of the cash). We see another flashback of Ray playing with a country band and the man counting single $1 notes by implying they are $20 to pay Ray. Luckily another band member steps up and demands Ray be paid fairly. As Ray is becoming more and more popular with his music, a man from Atlantic Records discovers him. The man has written a song and offers to let Ray sing it. The song, ""The Mess Around"" becomes Ray's first hit.Ray ends up meeting Della Bea (Kerry Washington), a preacher's daughter. He falls in love with her, and the two get married. Della is not happy about Ray mixing gospel and soul music, but realizes he's got undeniable talent.Ray goes out on the road, and meets up with Mary Anne Fisher (Aunjanue Ellis), a singer who teams up with Ray. On a trip home, Della Bea finds Ray's drugs in his shaving bag, and demands he stop using. Ray refuses, and walks out on a pregnant Della Bea.Ray begins an affair with Mary Anne. As Ray's popularity grows, Ray gets a girl trio to become ""The Raylettes"". Ray immediately falls for Margie's (Regina King), the lead singer's charms, and the two begin an affair. Mary Anne grows resentful and begs Ray to give her a solo, which he does. Figuring now she's got her name out there, Mary Anne leaves Ray and his band, but not before throwing a brick through the windshield of his car out of jealousy over Ray and Margie.Another few years later, Ray is out on the road as a headliner, and one night while doing a set, the band finishes early. The owner of the club demands Ray fill the 20 minute slot he has left, and Ray makes up the hit ""What I'd Say"" on the spot.During the 1960s, Ray is becoming more and more popular. Ray is offered a better contract with another record label, and although he is loyal to Atlantic, Ray leaves them, but on amicable terms. Ray goes to Atlanta to play a concert, and encounters civil rights protests. Ray protests by saying that he will not play if the black concertgoers have to sit in the balcony. Ray ends up being barred from the state of Georgia.Another year or so later, Ray then wants to try and do different things with his music, and incorporates classical and country into his sound. Some of his biggest hits come from this mixture, such as ""Georgia on My Mind"" which Margie says will be Ray's downfall. Ray also records ""I Can't Stop Loving You"", for which he receives a standing ovation at one concert.While sleeping in a hotel room, Ray's sleep is interrupted by the police who burst in and arrest him. They tell him that they are acting on an anonymous tip that he has drugs in the room and are there to arrest him. Although heroin is found and Ray is charged with possession, he gets off on a legal technicality because the police didn't have a search warrant.Later, while in a hotel room with Margie, Ray is tinkling on the piano while she gets sick. Margie is pregnant, and demands Ray leave Della and his three children with her. Ray refuses, and Margie is angry. Ray tells Margie to keep her anger, while he literally writes ""Hit the Road Jack"" complete with Margie's solo. Now that she's got her name out there, Margie leaves the Raylettes to try and make a solo career for herself.Flashing forward another few years later in the early 1970s, we see Ray and Della Bea move into a huge new house with their kids. Della is uncomfortable in the new house. Ray has to go to Canada for another concert. But when he gets off the plane, he is arrested for possession of heroin at the customs booth. As a result, the Canadian authorities deport Ray back to the USA and his concert there is canceled. The record company has trouble getting him out of this trouble and a judge sentences Ray to go to a treatment clinic. Della and Ray fight about this and the phone rings.Picking up the phone, Ray learns from someone on the other line that Margie is dead... from a drug overdose. Ray swears to Della that he never turned her onto it and wouldn't let her use it when she was around him. Della says she will start sending money to Ray's child with Margie, but Ray tells Della he already sends him money. Ray goes to a rehab clinic where he suffers from withdrawals and nightmares.Throughout the movie, in flashbacks, we see how a young Ray slowly went blind nine months after watching his brother die. We see how his fiercely independent mother forces Ray to make his own way in the world and never to let anybody cripple or tell him otherwise just because he is blind. While at the rehab clinic going through painful heroin withdrawals, a now-grown Ray has a conversation with his dead mother, who chastises him for letting drugs cripple him. Ray tries to apologize, but his independent mother won't hear of it. Then his little brother George shows up and tells him that he doesn't blame him for his death.The movie ends in the year 1979 with Ray getting off drugs for good and receiving his proudest accomplishment. That same year, the state of Georgia officially apologizes to Ray and makes ""Georgia On My Mind"" the official state song. The movie ends with Ray, Della, and their three grown sons receiving applause after Ray performs the song before a live audience.The closing title card reads:This movie is dedicated to Ray Charles Robinson, 1930-2004.

"The true story of the rise to power and brutal assassination of the formerly vilified and later redeemed leader of the independent Congo, Patrice Lumumba. Using newly discovered historical evidence, Haitian-born and later Congo-raised writer and director Raoul Peck renders an emotional and tautly woven account of the mail clerk and beer salesman with a flair for oratory and an uncompromising belief in the capacity of his homeland to build a prosperous nation independent of its former Belgium overlords. Lumumba emerges here as the heroic sacrificial lamb dubiously portrayed by the international media and led to slaughter by commercial and political interests in Belgium, the United States, the international community, and Lumumba's own administration; a true story of political intrigue and murder where political entities, captains of commerce, and the military dovetail in their quest for economic and political hegemony.::L.

"""Good-Time Charlie"" Wilson, a flawed and fun-loving Congressman from the piney woods of East Texas, deftly operates the levers of power to funnel money and weapons to the Mujahideen of Afghanistan following the Soviet invasion of their country in late 1979. Charlie finds assistance in the oddest of places -- a renegade CIA agent whose outsider status and womanizing ways endears him to Wilson; a Houston socialite who leads Wilson to the cause; the willing Pakistani dictator fascinated by the socialite; the Israelis who modify and manufacture Soviet weapons to maintain the wink-and-nudge illusion of American neutrality; and the women -- ooh the women.Based on the story (and the excellent book of the same name) that is so true and engaging that artistic liberties are not needed, even if they are taken in the film."

"In the early 1980s, Charlie Wilson is a womanizing US congressional representative from Texas who seemed to be in the minor leagues, except for the fact that he is a member of two major foreign policy and covert-ops committees. However, prodded by his major conservative supporter, Houston Socialite Joanne Herring, Wilson learns about the plight the people are suffering in the brutal Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. With the help of the maverick CIA agent, Gustav ""Gust"" Avrakotos, Wilson dedicates his canny political efforts to supply the Afghan mujahideen with the weapons and support to defeat the Soviet Union.

"Congressman Charlie Wilson represents the second congressional district in Texas. For those few who know or know of him, he is seen as a lightweight congressman, who is more than willing to sell his votes in the house. As such, he has collected more IOUs than any other congressman. He is also an illicit drug user and womanizer, who staffs his office with attractive young women. He is able to get away with all this behavior since little scrutiny is placed on him because no one pays any attention to him. In 1980, he begins an interest in the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan after seeing network news reports and speaking to one of his women friends, the wealthy Joanne Herring, a right wing, fundamentalist Christian zealot. He is dismayed to learn that the US has no official policy on the Afghan situation, only supporting the Afghan side of the war - the mujahideen - with a meager $10 million. And within the CIA, there is only an unofficial and clandestine policy of wanting to bleed the Soviets at the expense of the Afghan people. Charlie wants to speak to a high ranking CIA official about the situation, but instead is sent Gust Avrakotos, a committed but disgruntled CIA operative working the Afghan file, whose appointment was not meant to be meritorious. Charlie and Gust end up working together on a covert mission toward the common goal of arming and training the mujahideen to defeat the Soviets. Gust works the strategic side within the CIA, and Charlie, calling in whatever favor he can, works the political and diplomatic side. Charlie's tasks are not easy as he has to bring together not only disparate but often hostile opposing political and religious forces to achieve his goal. Charlie learns that his personal life may come back to haunt him, and that winning the war may come with unexpected consequences.::Huggo"

"A highly fictionalized account of the life of George Armstrong Custer from his arrival at West Point in 1857 to his death at the battle of the Little Big Horn in 1876. He has little discipline at the academy but is prepared to stand up to the senior cadet, Ned Sharp, who makes his life miserable. While there he catches the eye of the commandant, Col. (later General) Phil Sheridan and also meets his future bride, Elizabeth Bacon. Graduating early due to the Civil War, it is only through a chance meeting with General Winfield Scott that he finally gets assigned to a cavalry regiment. He served with distinction during the war and when he is promoted to Brigadier General in error, he leads his troops in a decisive victory. He has little to do after the war turning down lucrative positions in private industry and it's his wife who arranges with Gen. Scott for him to be appointed a Lt. Colonel and given command of the 7th Cavalry. He is depicted as a friend of the Indians who will fight for injustice, in the form of his old nemesis Ned Sharp who is taking advantage of them and trying to provoke a war with his own financial gain in mind.

"The EIGHTH and final movie featuring Errol Flynn and Olivia De Havilland is definitely not an accurate History lesson; it is, instead, a retelling of the Custer myth - with the added sheen of magnetic stars, colorful (and even distinguished) character parts and rousing action sequences. Most of the first half of this long movie has a refreshing comic element as Custer bungles and brawls his way through West Point; the start of the American Civil War introduces some well shot and convincing battle scenes; the final part of the picture covers Custer's achievements with the fabled 7th Cavalry in the Dakota Territories. The romantic relationship between Flynn and De Havilland's characters touchingly links the different segments - both were instinctively aware that this was their last picture together and it gave their shared scenes a special poignancy. Throughout the movie, Custer is represented as a noble and heroic figure - so devoid of cunning and guile that he is almost bound to make a less than brilliant strategist. A completely ficticious plot-line turns him into a defender of Native American lands as unscrupulous businessmen conspire to start a war between the USA and the Sioux Nation. Ultimately, Custer and his regiment are forced to intercept the Sioux and their allies. Destiny awaits them at The Little Big Horn.::Deadlypen"

He asks Chris to partner with him in the drug business; Chris is not interested and declines.Charlie Boyce (Pat Hingle), Chris's father, pulls strings to get Chris a job at RTX, a large telecommunication company.

After a security review, Chris is assigned to the Vault, a classified area of RTX that is responsible for transmitting encrypted messages among CIA agencies worldwide.

Chris admits he was wrong, that the Russians are just as paranoid and manipulative as the U.S. Daulton tells Christopher he agrees; he's finished and he'll do jail time for his crimes if he has to.

"Copying Beethoven is a period drama about the last year of Beethoven(Ed Harris)'s life. The opening scene shows a dying Ludwig van Beethoven. Anna Holz (Diane Kruger) is witness to that moment. Immediately the emotional intensity of their relationship becomes clear. The story takes us back to the moment Wenzel Schlemmer (Ralph Riach), Beethoven's publisher, is desparate for a good copyist to help Beethoven complete the score in time for the first performance of his Ninth Symphony. Anna Holz (a fictional character, probably named after a good friend of Beethoven at the end of his life: Karl Holz), being the best copyist available is introduced to Beethoven. And although he is shocked at first expecting a male copyist they start working very well together and Anna helps Beethoven to conduct the impressive premiere of his last symphony. Meanwhile Martin Bauer (Matthew Goode), the love interest of Anna, is working on the design of a new bridge. Martin works with his brain. Beethoven is devoted to the human heart and soul. Anna is caught in between. When Beethoven helps Martin to 'improve the design of his bridge' by smashing the maquette in pieces and comments very rude to one of Anna's own compositions she leaves him. He begs her to come back appologising to her. She gives in recognizing that art and love cannot be controlled by ratio. They keep working together on Beethoven's as well as on Anna's compositons until his death. As a subplot we see Beethoven struggling with his nephew, Karl van Beethoven (Joe Anderson). Karl avoids contact with his uncle because he cannot live up to Ludwig's hope for a worthy successor. But he also avoids Beethoven because he steals money to pay off his gambling depts."

"Vienna, 1824. In the days before the first performance of the Ninth Symphony, Beethoven needs help with copying out the charts, so a promising student of composition, Anna Holtz, 23, is sent to assist him. She not only aids the transcription of the notes, she provides guidance from the orchestra pit as Beethoven conducts the work's debut. During the next two years, the final ones of Beethoven's life, Anna provides assistance to the deaf, temperamental, ailing man. In return, he tutors her in composition and explains to her the ideas and principles of Romanticism. He tries to speak for God.::<jhailey@hotmail.com>"
"Anna, a talented and idealistic young, music student, is sent to transcribe orchestra music for her favourite composer just days before his performance of the 9th symphony. Shocked when she finds the man Beethoven to be over-bearing and crude, Anna only begins to understand the impetus of his genius, passion, and drive for music thru the music itself, and his often difficult mentoring style. Set in 1824 Vienna, this imagined story is both 'ugly' and beautiful as we are given a glimpse into the amazing mind during the last days of the master composer.::signlady"

"The opening scene is in the throne room of the King of Poland, which has a floor resembling a giant chess board. The costumes are rich and ornate, and Polonaises, the music of Poland, play in the background throughout. Prince Andrei Kurbsky (Mikhail Nazvanov), formerly a best friend to Ivan, enters to hand his sword to the King, who receives it, then returns it, symbolizing a new vassal to lord relationship. Some of Kurbsky's formerly Russian lands are thus passed to Polish control. The courtiers in attendance are all smiles and welcoming faces. Many good looking ladies are sizing up Kurbsky. The ladies use their eyes to show interest either in the man or in the words he says.The happy atmosphere is interrupted by a disheveled courier who arrives and breathlessly announces that Ivan has returned to Moscow as Tsar. At this news, the party is over, and all present quickly leave the throne room.Ivan (Nikolai Cherkasov), back in Moscow as Tsar, looks older and more tired, and there is even a glint of madness and fear in his eyes. Stung at having had one boyar, namely Kurbsky, defect and put Russian land in foreign hands, he wants a new system where the land is always part of Russia and the boyars are caretaker managers of their districts with no power to transfer the land to outsiders. Since this increases his power at the expense of the hereditary landowners, the boyars, they unite in opposition to his plans, and he is alone and friendless.When he laments that he has no one to trust, the only he could trust was his wife and companion, now dead, the chief of his landless supporters, Czar's Guard Aleksei Basmanov (Amvrosi Buchma) tells Ivan that he is a true friend who can be trusted. Ivan immediately scolds him, telling him he cannot be a friend, since he is a hired servant.Basmanov and the Oprichniki help Ivan consolidate his power over the boyars with terror, arranging for the elimination of some of them.Needing friendship, and wanting to have somebody around to trust, he brings to court his old friend Kolychev, who has become Philip the monk, and makes him metropolitan bishop of Moscow. Philip is not willing to help Ivan in any way, insisting that the Tsars role must be to guarantee that old traditional ways of doing things will be maintained. Ivan is so sad and obsessed to have company that he even begs Philip on his knees to remain his friend.Philip agrees, but his intent is to try to bend Ivan to the will of the Church, and exacts a promise that he will have the right to intercede for anyone condemned to death. Philip is frustrated by what he sees as Ivan's misuse of power, as he takes his cues from the boyars.Meantime, Ivan has become used to using executions to consolidate his political power, killing not only those who openly defy, plot or disobey, but even people that he guesses might resent one of his upcoming decisions, such as the person Philip replaces in Moscow.Ivan faces down Philip and lets loose his private force, the Oprichniks, on the boyars. Although as Tsar he must keep his word, he circumvents his promise to Philip by executing those condemned so quickly that they are dead before Philip has even the news that might lead to a plea for intercession. In this way he has three boyars executed. About this time his nickname the Terrible begins to be used.As a sort of explanation of Ivan's relentless will to crush the Boyars, we see a flashback to Ivan's childhood. His mother was poisoned by boyars, and her last words to him were ""Don't trust the boyars."" Although young Ivan (Erik Pyryev) is given to wear the trappings of authority in Muscovy, decisions are made by a couple of old boyars who mock him when he asks questions. A bit later he learns that even very young he can assert his authority if he persists and has the will.The boyars, close to desperation, plead their case to Philip and win him over. He vows to block Ivan's abuse of power. In the cathedral a mystery is in process, the songs and representation telling about the terrible torments of fire that await those who refuse to do the will of God. Philip confronts Ivan, and as the argument heats up, Ivan, angry, proclaims that he will be exactly what the boyars call him, the Terrible, and has Philip seized.Fyodor Basmanov (Mikhail Kuznetsov), the first of the Oprichnina, helps Ivan figure out that the Tsarina was poisoned, and both suspect Ivan's aunt Efrosinia (Serafima Birman) of poisoning the wine cup. Ivan orders Fyodor not to say anything about it until he (Ivan) is certain beyond doubt of her guilt.Led by the Tsar's aunt, Efrosinia, the boyars now decide that their only option is to assassinate Ivan and enthrone her son, Vladimir (Pavel Kadochnikov). The novice Pyotr is selected to wield the knife.Ivan, wanting to ascertain Efrosinia's guilt, invites Vladimir to a banquet with the Oprichnina. Vladimir doesnt want to go, but Efrosinia insists that he go and take Pyotr with him, thinking that a magnificent opportunity for the murder has arisen.Ivan gets Vladimir drunk while the Oprichnina sing and dance around them. Ivan manipulates Vladimir, telling him he is a dear cousin, that its too bad they aren't good friends who tell each other confidences. The drunk Vladimir mentions that his mother wants him to be Tsar, even though he himself doesn't want it. Later he lets on that there is a plot to kill Ivan. With this, Ivan is now absolutely sure that Efrosinia was his wife's poisoner.Fyodor Basmanov notices Pyotr leaving, someone who did not belong in the party, and signals Ivan.Ivan, pretending surprise at Vladimir's revelation, suggests to Vladimir that being Tsar is not so bad. He convinces Vladimir to try being Tsar for a while, and has the Oprichnina bring throne, orb, scepter, crown and royal robes. Vladimir is dressed up as Tsar and they all bow down to ""Tsar Vladimir.""Then Ivan tells Vladimir to lead them, in full regalia, to the cathedral to pray, as a Tsar should lead. With much hesitation and fear, Vladimir does. In the cathedral, the assassin runs up and stabs the mock Tsar, and is immediately seized by Fyodor and Malyuta.Ivan orders them to release Pyotr, and thanks him for killing the tsar's worst enemy. Efrosinia arrives, jubilant at the apparent death of Ivan, until she sees Ivan alive. Rolling the corpse over, she sees it is her own son, screeches in desperation while holding Vladimir in a pose reminiscent of Michelangelo's Piet.Ivan sentences her. Then, in a final soliloquy, Ivan proclaims that all his enemies within Moscow are vanquished so he can now concentrate to those outside."

Philip, however, takes his cues from the boyars and tries to bend Ivan to the will of the church. Ivan faces down Philip and lets loose his private force, the Oprichniks, on the boyars.

"In 1547, Ivan IV, then Archduke of Muscovy (Nikolai Cherkasov), crowns himself as Tsar of all the Russias in the cathedral. We see the crown, and then the elaborate ritual of coronation. In the sidelines, aristocratic attendees, the boyars, whisper expressing discontent at his elevation. Among them is Ivan's aunt, Efrosinia Staritskaya (Serafima Birman), who wants to advance her son Dmitri, a simpleton.Ivan proclaims his will to recover lost territories, unite and protect Russia against foreign armies outside her borders, and the enemies within, announcing that absolute rule with an iron fist will be imperative. In a series of reaction shots, we see that boyars, officials and clergymen wanted a puppet ruler, and are unpleasantly surprised.Soon Ivan marries Anastasia Romanovna (Lyudmila Tselikovskaya), and a wedding celebration takes place. The marriage causes him to lose his two best friends, Prince Andrei Kurbsky (Mikhail Nazvanov), a warrior who wanted both power and the hand of Anastasia, and Fyodor Kolychev (Andrei Abrikosov). The latter receives Ivan's permission to retreat to a monastery, while Kurbsky insinuates himself to the Tsarina, who repels his advances.The wedding feast is interrupted by news of the burning of several boyar palaces, carried into the Tsar's palace by a mob of the common people who also complain that the Tsar is being led astray by the Tsarina's family, the Glinskys and the Romanovs.Ivan calms the crowd. Fyodor Basmanov (Amvrosi Buchma), a commoner who acted as spokesman for the unruly crowd, is impressed by the Tsar and becomes his loyal supporter.The scene is interrupted by two envoys from the khanate of Kazan, who deliver to Ivan an insulting message and present him, as a gift, with a ceremonial knife with the suggestion that he do himself a favor by using it to commit suicide.Ivan proclaims at once that Russia is at war with Kazan. At the siege of Kazan, A group led by Basmanov digs a tunnel under the city wall and fills it with gunpowder.Kurbsky, nominally in command, is reprimanded by Ivan for senseless brutality: Kurbsky has tied Tartar prisoners within earshot of the walls of Kazan and orders them to shout to the city to surrender. The defending archers immediately kill the prisoners with their arrows. The attack order is given, the gunpowder charges are detonated, and the city of Kazan is captured.After the return from Kazan, Ivan falls seriously ill and is thought to be on his deathbed. Orthodox priests come to give him the last rites. He holds a lit candle over his chest, and a Bible is placed over his head. The elaborate ceremony convinces him he is about to die. With a last burst of energy, Ivan orders those around him to swear allegiance to his son, the infant Dmitri, reminding them of the need for a single ruler to keep Russia united. They demur, with Ivan's aunt, Efrosinia, openly urging others to swear allegiance to her son Vladimir instead.Emotionally overwrought, Ivan collapses and is thought dead. The relatives, celebrating, all begin to swear allegiance to Vladimir, the ""boyar tsar"" they have hoped for.Meanwhile, Kurbsky is uncertain of his own loyalty, trying to decide between the two sides. Kurbsky believes Ivan dead, so he approaches the Tsarina about joining forces with him, becoming his wife, in exchange for his swearing loyalty to Dmitri. A huge face of Jesus painted on the wall appears to be watching them. The Tsarina runs away from him back to Ivan's bedroom.When the Tsarina returns, she says, ""Do not bury a man before he is dead."" Kurbsky realizes that Ivan is still alive, and publicly swears his allegiance to Ivan's infant son, Dmitri. Ivan reappears, crediting the anointing for curing him miraculously.Kurbsky is appointed army leader as a reward for his loyalty, and sent to the western border of the kingdom to defend against the Livonians and Poles. At the same time, Ivan dispatches Alexei Basmanov (Amvrosi Buchma), the commoner he sympathizes with, to the south to take care of the Crimean border.The Tsarina now falls ill, and while Ivan is receiving bad news from all fronts, the boyars plot to kill her. A staring duel takes place between the aunt and the wife. Efrosinia comes into the palace with a cup of wine hidden in her robes, into which she puts poison. Just as the royal couple receive word that Kurbsky has defected to the Livonians, Efrosinia slips the cup of wine into the room and listens from behind a wall. The Tsarina has a convulsion and Ivan, looking around for a way to help her, takes the poisoned wine and gives it to her.The dead Tsarina is lying in state in the cathedral, with Ivan mourning below her bier. While a monk reads biblical verses over the body, Ivan questions his own justifications and ability to rule, wondering if his wife's death is God's punishment for him.However, he pulls himself out of it, and sends for Kolychev.At this point, Basmanov arrives, suggesting that Ivan surround himself with men he can trust, ""iron men,"" the Oprichnina, and offers his rather startled son, Fyodor, for service. Ivan accepts the idea, and sets about reorganizing his power base.Town criers announce to the populace that Ivan has quarrels with the Boyars, but not with the commoners or tradesmen. The commoners , led by Basmanov, who become Ivan's loyal retainers cannot understand why he simply does not kill all the boyars who are plotting against him. He abdicates, leaves Moscow and retires to nearby Alexandrov monastery, waiting until the people beg him to return.Not long after, a popular movement organizes a mass march, and an enormous broad line of people walk to Alexandrov to request him to reassume his position of Czar again. He sees them coming from afar, receives their plea, delivers a speech, and becomes stronger with the support of the common Muscovites."

"During the Last Bastion of the Spanish Inquisition, 1790-1810, An Inquistador named Lorenzo (Javir Baldem) is being painted on various visits by artist Fransisco Goya when his fellows say Goya is painting whores as angels. Lorenzo tries to defend his work, saying it is those people--the whores and maimed --who the church needed to reach, to keep them from committing acts against God, not the artist just painting what he saw; then tells younger church leaders to pick up the Inquisition, search for those secretly practicing other religions.
Into this hyped -up search for heathens, a rich merchant's young daughter out one evening (Natalie Portman as Inez) is said to have refused to have eaten pork , making her practicing Jewish rituals secretly...Incidently she is a model Goya used who was an angel on a church ceiling; Lorenzo displayed an interest in her by asking if long hours with such models made Goya think of other things, and what was her name. Goya ignores the last but says ""You have too acute an eye, Brother Lorenzo."" When the girl's father comes to him and says Inez is a Church prisioner, Goya is angry but refuses to ask Lorenzo about her freedom.
The father donates all his gold to the church for his daughter. Goya allows him to leave the gold , pay for the painting of the Brother, and tells Brother Lorenzo the deal. She is kept by the Catholic Church for trial, and ""put to the question"" ,which brother Lorenzo has learned for her family but believes in the sanctity of--if you were innocent, God gave you the fortitude to withstand torture and you didn't sign guilt to a lie. Lying to escape torture went against God. If you lied you were just as much a heretic as if you'd done the act. The girl has admitted she did it after extreme torture and Brother Lorenzo tries to take leave of her family when her father has his sons and servants hold him. Goya, also present, is telling the father,"" you don't treat Brother Lorenzo like that !"" when they grab him and bar the doors. They will let Goya free alone. After torture, Brother Lorenzo signs a rediculous paper that he had to be tortured pretty bad to sign. The father says he will produce it if Lorenzo does not get his daughter out.
Lorenzo is next seen walking slowly down the Church's prison hall, looking into cells. He finally finds the girl, younger and dressed in rags that show her more sexual than even the artist had made her in sheer angel gowns. He tries to look away and put his overcoat on her but as she leans to him to pray with him and he watches the sharp little mind love his Lord so much and speak so fast and earnestly, he suddenly pulls her to him and says ""I do care about you, I do"" and ""that's alright"" as she struggles. His new discovery is a selfish one (it doesn't mattter if she cares about him, he hasn't asked if he can hold her tight, he is only learning that the real girl in the painting, so infatuating, was someone he also actually cared for.) He may also have meant that in matters of the flesh he had not expected to care about his target. So he'd go to her , say do you want to pray with me, at which she'd fall into his love, say ""Love me"".Obviously he did--years later he learns they had a child.
Meantime the rich merchant has brought the Catholic Tribunal or whatever the signed statement and they are searching for Lorenzo, who has fled. Goya is visited by the church who takes his painting of Lorenzo away as part of a heresy trial they're working up on him. Lorenzo's signature showed the merchant and townspeople that torture did not work and was unfair; it showed church heads that people were in danger of not trusting ""The Question"" and that God gave His people fortitude to withstand torture--only bad people signed, making Lorenzo a false man of God.
Although Lorenzo was alone in Inez's room with her at least several times, he never tried to help her escape, even when he ran, himself--he left her there. He ran to France where the French Revolutionaries got him into a Spanish Revolution. He comes back as a leader of the Spanish uprising., and has fun sentencing to death the old Church leader who wanted him killed. He has a nice office into which Goya comes, now fully deaf. He tells Lorenzo that Inez was finally released, after Lorenzo says he could never forget the family--they were what changed him. Lorenzo has him bring her in.
She's a mess. She's just found no one waiting for her on release, walked home, and her family was dead around the stripped house. She has not combed her hair or looked in a mirror, has a ""mad"" twist to her mouth, but lights up at sight of Lorenzo and runs to him and begins to kiss his hand all over. Lorenzo kind of sits where she can't keep it up and asks gently what he can do for her. She says they took her baby. She says ""our baby."" He tries, looking at the deaf artist, to correct her. She says he's the only man she's been with. He asks if she knows how long she was locked up. She has no idea. (The baby would be 20). She's still looking for a baby she can raise. Lorenzo has a wife he loves, he's told Goya, and children, and can make 10 paintings, his family is so big now.He tells Inez two men will take her to her baby and she leaves happily. Goya demands to know where he really sent her. ""She is out of her mind, she'll always be safe,"" Lorenzo says."" Part of her insanity is to think he could have fathered a baby with her; Sorry she's changed to this.... Goya doesn't buy it and tracks down the baby and finds it is a hooker in a hooker park.
On his own Lorenzo has already tracked babies who were born in the Catholic dungeons and found she had run from an Catholic orphanage at age 7 and has cautiously also asked if the parents' names were written anywhere and told no. He has a soft, smiling manner of asking and it doesn't seem he is collecting very important information . He fondled a young girl's head in the orphanage, whom he seemed to hope was his, asking which one in the room was her, looking at all these girls under 18. But that's when they said none; she ran off at age 7. Her given name was Alicia. Now Goya comes to see him again. He has found the daughter. Where? Lorenzo demands. Goya bitterly tells.Lorenzo says in his calm way, "" How do you know this is Inez's child?"" ""Because she looks exactly like the face I saw whenever I shut my eyes, the face that's haunted me all my life,..."" As Goya goes on Lorenzo says ""You are obsessed with Inez!"" and Goya defends himself. He's looking out for her, which Lorenzo knows in his heart he is not. Goya has seen Alicia get in a rich man's carraige and go off for the night; the old lady peddling her say Goya can have her next. What he doesn't know is that Lorenzo is on that carraige, one time we are unexpectedly happy to see actor Javier Baldem, and when Alicia (Natalie Portman, also) tries to move on him, slaps her away angrily. This is his daughter. He offers to send her to America, he wants her to leave Spain (so Goya can't force a meeting). The girl gets sassy and attacks and is out of there like a bobcat while the big heavy Lorenzo is left asking her to please come back. Later Goya tries to arrange for the two to meet, after Lorenzo warns him with deep anger that there is no way he is going to help a mother learn that her daughter is a harlot and asks why he won't leave it alone. Goya has Inez, who he bailed out of a home for the insane, in his carraige and is in the bar trying to get Alicia to come out and meet her. Alicia says""Why would I care?"" but then a counter-revolutionary attack with the Bitish involved enters the bar and arrests the harlots, dragging Alicia away so that she looses her baby she was holding. Another girl has handed it to her while going off on a date, but we never know if it is really Alicia's or not. It is left crying under a table. Inez has gotten out of the carraige and walks upon the carnage, used to it, and picks up the baby. She later talks to the shocked Goya like it's hers. He has seen Alicia carted off.
Alicia's group are freed by some handsome British , one who Alicia catches the eye of with a winking smile.
Goya is in Lorenzo's office . They are accusing each other of whoring to be there. Lorenzo went from church to revolution-- -well, Goya paints for the king, paints for the new leadership when the King is deposed, paints for anyone, paints for money, Lorenzo spits. At least, maybe he didn't see the light at first, but Lorenzo has morals. Just then there is news that the British are advancing , no one is stopping them, and Lorenzo runs out and gets his wife and kids hurriedly in a coach and is following them on horse when the Brits reach him. He turns off to let the coach get away, and mobs reach him and drag him into town, where the Catholics are reinstated in power and try him instantly, find him guilty, and sentence him to death. If he repents he will be spared. He looks at them, throws their pen down. He did not pass this test last time.
This time he is not going to be tortured, just have his neck cleanly broke. As he looks at a world where the man who sentenced him to death called him ""my son"", and few know him by name--Lorenzo--he can only look at a mob of strangers and see the new leadership walk out --his granddaughter now part of the inner royal circle as she stands thereon the courtly balcony with what appear to be the new King , Queen, and prince, Alicia at his side like royalty, never noticing Lorenzo as she smiled at the crowd and danced as his neck broke. But Lorenzo saw that she was doing all right for herself--that she knew how to ""whore"" through life. And that her days of abuse by men were over. Then he hears his name out of the crowd and, sweat filling his eyes with salt, just makes out the young face he'd ""cared for"", twisted and stark-raving mad, smiling broadly as she holds up a baby. He manages to give her a smile. I felt something was left out here as the baby should have confused him, made him think, oh, oh. And I felt a scene where he had to acknowledge he'd known her was in order , and should have been between all his dismissals of her as nuts while not really meeting her eyes, and this smile as if the sight of her (as she then was, out of her mind) pleased him . Only two times did it seem he cared about her--when he said ""I do care about you"" and when he said tersely that he'd never tell a mother that her daughter was a harlot. Nothing explained the kind of smile she evoked from him except if he had once loved that face while it smiled and to see it again was a present, a gift. It beat seeing her fighting for him, yelling no, getting pushed down,as he died--but her simpleton-manner, ""everything's great now, I have a baby"", would not have been enough to make me smile--I'd rather have seen her in her real mind, knowing what was going on , that I was about to die . But that out-of-it smile got him to smile as he watched the world be wrong about its need to murder him for being a heretic. In the end, children dance and sing around his body being dragged, head down , on a cart; the crazy girl joins them, picking up his hand and kissing it as Goya brings up the rear yelling ""Inez!""
You don't want to talk about anything else after it's over, and it keeps popping up as you go about the next 6 or 8 hours, heavier fare than the things you are usually involved with. You keep thinking. Was he good to her? That smile, that was the one time, that she knew of, as she had no idea he'd talked to her baby , that it had grown up.But she thought he was her love. She'd kept a candle lit for him. The smile was a gift to her. He was ultimately, finally, good to her. But never enough--for his part in creating her crazed mind, a baby raised in an orphanage, etc.He never took on that guilt, unless in trying to make the harlot daughter go away."

"The story opens in New York City where Benjamin Siegel, an organized crime boss whose partners are Charlie ""Lucky"" Luciano and Meyer Lansky, visits the office of one of their lesser partners and kills him for stealing from the organization. Ben does so in full view of the man's workers, knowing his reputation will protect him. Often called ""Bugsy"" but hating the nickname (and willing to beat or kill someone for using it), Siegel is being sent to Los Angeles to broker a deal with another gangster, Jack Dragna, in an effort to expand their operations.Siegel boards a train after saying goodbye to his wife Esta and their two girls. He's visited by Harry Greenberg, an old friend who is irresponsible with his end of Siegel's organization and asks Siegel for money. Disgusted, Siegel gives Greenberg a large sum and dismisses him to sit under a UV lamp and work on his tan.Arriving in Los Angeles, Siegel is met by another old friend, the actor George Raft, who takes Ben to a studio where the movie Manpower is being shot. On the set, Ben notices a woman, Virginia Hill, who has a job as an extra. Ben is attracted to her immediately and talks to her briefly before she walks off, seemingly uninterested and insulting his ego. George drives Ben back to his hotel through Beverly Hills, pointing out the houses of famous Hollywood people. When George mentions opera singer Lawrence Tibbett, Ben asks George to leave him there. Ben meets with Tibbett himself and mildly coerces Tibbett into selling his house, offering straight cash and settling on an amount several thousand dollars more than Tibbett paid for the house. Tibbett agrees. A few scenes later, Siegel buys a luxury car from a random person on the street.Siegel meets with Dragna and his associates at Dragna's office. Dragna isn't interested in Siegel's offer to expand his own business, much less aid Siegel & his associates. Siegel counters, saying that if Dragna won't do business, he'll have to shoot Siegel himself, and even hands Dragna a pistol. Everyone ends up laughing, however Dragna still points out that Siegel's reputation for being a psychotic hothead precedes him and agrees to the deal. When one of Dragna's associates asks why Dragna didn't shoot Siegel when the had the chance, Dragna tells him that all-out war with Siegel's partners, Luciano & Lansky, isn't worth it.Virginia Hill shows up at Ben's new house and the two begin a torrid love affair. Ben receives a call from Dragna who tells him that his office had been robbed by a small-time gangster, Mickey Cohen. Though no one could see Cohen's face, they knew it was him. Ben asks Raft to have Cohen meet him at a spa. When Cohen arrives, Siegel politely demands the return of the money Cohen stole. Cohen unleashes a torrent of verbal insult and also tells Ben that he'd stolen a lesser amount than Dragna reported. Siegel recognizes that Cohen possesses a larger talent for collecting and enforcement and hires Cohen on the spot after Cohen agrees to give back the money he stole. Cohen also reveals that Virginia has a reputation for being promiscuous in LA, something that Ben jealously takes notice of immediately.At home, Virginia makes an elegant dinner for Ben, who acts aloof, dropping subtle hints about Virginia's past love life. Virginia is insulted and throws an ashtray at Ben, hitting him in the head. The two are still arguing loudly when Cohen shows up with the money. Ben waits for Jack Dragna to arrive a few minutes later and shows him the cash. Ben then tells Dragna that he gave the job of running Siegel's operation in LA to Cohen, a job he'd intended to let Dragna have. Siegel then turns furious, accusing Dragna of stealing the difference in funds from the Cohen holdup for himself. After a moment of Russian Roulette and then making Dragna crawl around and bark like a dog, then oink like a pig, Ben gives Dragna the money, ordering him to return it to the the safe in the office, along with the cash Dragna himself misappropriated. Back in the dining room, Ben begins to indifferently eat the meal Virginia had prepared. Virginia, having eavesdropped on Ben's berating of Dragna, is sexually turned on and the two have sex.Bugsy continues to make plans and snap decisions on everything - he meets a countess whose husband is in immediate contact with Benito Mussolini, and plots to kill the dictator. Bugsy begins bringing Virginia on his trips, but she refuses to fly. In the Nevada desert near the small roadside stop of Las Vegas, Ben checks out a small diner with a few slot machines that does turn a small profit but is too small to keep open. Ben closes the place and the trio heads back to LA. In the desert, after an short argument with Virginia about his family back in New York, Ben has an epiphany. He goes back to the car and tells Cohen and Virginia about it. Virginia is unimpressed and drives off with Ben's car, leaving the two stranded.When Ben goes to his home in New York and tells his mob buddies about a new venture, The Flamingo casino/hotel, which will be located in a state where gambling is permitted, he tries to juggle the search for Virginia, the proposal to his partners, and his daughter Millicent's birthday party. His proposal is successful, but his family life is disintegrating. His business dealings intrude on Millicent's birthday, leaving her upset. Despite a promise to Virginia, he fails to ask his wife Esta for a divorce. Lansky says that he likes Ben's idea about the hotel/casino, though it will need final approval from Luciano. Ben also tells Meyer about his plans to kill Mussolini, an idea that Meyer nixes immediately. Meyer is afraid that the rest of their mob won't take Ben seriously if he talks about the plot. Bugsy also talks to another of their associates, Joey Adonis, who'd once dated Virginia. Bugsy apologizes for stealing Virginia away from Joey. Joey hits him and states emphatically that he was never in love with her and that she's a slut.Bugsy returns to Hollywood to convince Virginia of his dream -- he flies into another psychotic episode when he finds her entertaining another man. Ben throws the man through a patio door, ordering him to leave before he kills him. Virginia yells at Ben telling him that the man is her brother Chick. Ben tries to make amends by promising to buy Chick a new Cadillac. Virginia is disgusted at the thought of Ben trying to buy Chick's forgiveness and stalks off. Ben is able to talk to Virginia, telling her that the hotel he's planning to build will be named after her, ""The Flamingo"".Design begins on the hotel, with Bugsy exhibiting his mania -- he seems unconcerned at first with the ballooning budget when he orders several expensive changes. Bugsy also believes Virginia is flirting with the younger of the two architects and jealously tells Mickey and George.Harry Greenberg arrives at Ben's home in LA, having escaped from prosecutors, previously planning on informing on the mob. Bugsy takes Harry for a ""drive"", and Virginia insists on coming along. Bugsy and Harry get out of the car and Virginia, still in the car, hears a couple of faint gunshots. Only Bugsy returns, muttering his mantra, ""Twenty dwarves took turns doing handstands on the carpet."" Virginia looks nervous. At a retirement party for one of the partners, Bugsy finds Joey Adonis and beats him almost to death over insulting Virginia when Adonis hit him. Esta finally realizes why Bugsy is spending so much time away, and demands that he ask for a divorce.Construction on the Flamingo begins, and costs skyrocket. Bugsy gets arrested for the murder of Harry Greenberg. He's held without bail, but is afforded many luxuries, like a butler and telephone, where he continues to organize the build. Virginia runs the construction onsite, and travels back to brief Bugsy in jail. Bugsy continues to make rash decisions, and costs escalate. Meyer tries to reason with him, telling him he can help with some of the costs, and Bugsy says he'll sell his shares of the casino, just to get it built. He sells everything he can to raise money.Bugsy is released (Ben had arranged for Mickey Cohen to send the cab driver witness out of town unharmed), and returns to Las Vegas. Cohen tells Bugsy that Virginia has been skimming money from him. One day Virginia sees Ben talking to a young woman about being a coat-check attendant and Virginia interprets his conversation as flirting. She rushes upstairs and the two have a loud argument. Virginia is fed up with Ben's grand scheming and has decided to leave him. During the argument, Ben confronts her about a private bank account she's taken out herself. More furious than ever, Virginia walks out on Ben.The mob meets in Havana, where Charlie Luciano lives in exile, to determine whether Bugsy knew about the skimming and about the inflated cost of the hotel, which is estimated to come in at at total cost of $6 million and will open on Christmas Day with several famous guests and a grand event to mark the occasion. Meyer defends him, but knows he'll have to handle Bugsy if the hotel fails.The hotel opens on Christmas, and is a failure. The night is severely stormy, water leaks in through the light fixtures, some of the more famous guests haven't shown up and the power goes out. Ben announces to the crowd that the hotel will be closed for an indeterminate period until it can be reopened.Meyer orders Bugsy to fly back to LA. Before he leaves, he talks to Meyer on the phone, asking Meyer to protect Virginia no matter what happens. He also tells Meyer never to sell his shares in the hotel because the place will one day pay off. Virginia returns before he leaves and gives him back some of the money she skimmed. He refuses to take the money but forgives her. He returns home, and is assassinated in his own living room by snipers. The mob takes over the Flamingo and tells Virginia that Bugsy is dead. Title cards before the final credits state that Virginia returned the money she skimmed to Meyer and committed suicide while living Austria. However, Bugsy's investment generated billions of dollars of revenue, and Las Vegas grew into a massive entertainment capital."

Obsessive manhunt to identify and capture a despicable serial killer.::Anonymous
"The movie opens in November 1941 with a British submarine-launched commando raid on the shores of Libya. The target of the raid is General Erwin Rommel of the German Afrika Korps, who is enjoying considerable success against British troops in North Africa. The daring raid produces plenty of casualties but misses Rommel. Rommel is gaining legendary status with his British enemies.A captured British Lieutenant Colonel, Desmond Young, soon has a chance encounter with the celebrated Rommel in the midst of a desert artillery barrage. Rommel treats Young with respect and chivalry, inspiring the British officer after the war to investigate the life and mysterious death of the great general.Rommel's story is told in retrospect, beginning with the defeat of German forces at El Alamein in late 1942. Rommel, by now a Field Marshal, had been away from the front on medical leave, but he is forced to return in an attempt to stem the British tide. Rommel fights gallantly but becomes increasingly disenchanted with Hitler's interference and maniacal insistence on victory or death.Shortly before the total defeat of German forces in North Africa in the spring of 1943, Rommel is again invalided back to Germany. In the hospital, Rommel is visited by his wife Lucie (Jessica Tandy), his son Manfred, and Dr. Karl Strolin (Cedric Hardwicke), the Lord Mayor of Stuttgart and an early conspirator against Hitler. Strolin's presence arouses the suspicion of the SS and Gestapo. Rommel confides to Strolin that Hitler has accused him of cowardice and hinted at having him shot, and that Hitler had callously abandoned his beloved Afrika Korps. He further confides that Hitler no longer believes victory is possible, and that he only fights on because the Allies would never make peace with him. That can only mean that Germany and her people will be forced to fight to the death. Strolin provides Rommel with a dire warning about Hitler's unstable and vindictive nature.Rommel returns to active duty in November 1943, overseeing the defensive preparations for the expected Allied invasion in the West. Rommel works tirelessly to improve the woefully weak German fortifications. Reporting back to Field Marshal von Rundstedt (Leo G. Carroll), Rommel learns that Hitler himself is directing most aspects of the war. Von Rundstedt further warns Rommel that he will be under constant suspicion from Berlin.While Rommel is home on leave in February 1944, Dr. Strolin makes another attempt to enlist him in the growing conspiracy against Hitler. Rommel is offended and horrified at the thought of a military coup, and the discussion becomes heated. Strolin leaves without a commitment.Rommel soon returns to France and continues his defensive preparations. When D-Day arrives and the Allies gradually manage to expand their beachheads, Rommel frets over misallocated troops while von Rundstedt ridicules Hitler and his arbitrary decisions that tie their hands. Seeing an opening, Rommel tries to enlist von Rundstedt in the conspiracy to remove Hitler. But Rundstedt begs off, saying that while he agrees with them, he is too old to revolt. Rommel requests a final meeting with Hitler before firmly committing to his overthrow. The meeting is a disaster; Hitler blasts Rommel as a defeatist and promises miracle weapons that will soon turn the tide in Germany's favor.Rommel now resolves to join the other conspirators, remove Hitler, and sue for an honorable peace. But then, his staff car is caught on an open road by Allied fighter planes and badly strafed. Rommel is seriously injured. While he is recuperating in a French hospital, the failed July 20, 1944 assassination attempt against Hitler takes place.Three months after the assassination attempt, General Keitel phones Rommel, who is still convalescing at home. Keitel supposedly wants to inquire about Rommel's health and readiness for another command. When Rommel explains that it will be another few weeks before he is ready, Keitel offers to send someone down from Berlin to discuss a future command with him. The next day, General Wilhelm Burgdorf and another officer arrive at Rommel's home. Ominously, a truckload of armed soldiers waits on the main road.Rommel and the two officers retire to a private room to talk. Rommel is suddenly presented with a list of treason charges against him, stemming from the bomb plot. Rommel initially chooses to stand trial and address the charges, but it soon becomes apparent that he will not get the chance. Burgdorf makes it plain that Rommel's family will be in jeopardy should he not accept the only real option left to him- a poison capsule. In return, his family will be taken care of and Rommel will be publicly hailed as a national hero who succumbed to his war wounds. This deception will serve to prevent embarrassment for Adolf Hitler.Rommel bids a sad farewell to Lucie, his son Manfred, and his loyal aide Aldinger (Richard Boone). He then climbs into a staff car with the officers for a short and final ride. The film ends with a heartfelt tribute from Winston Churchill, who honored Rommel as a worthy adversary and decent man who came to hate Naziism."

"An understated chronicle of events with a brilliant cast. American actor Nick Nolte portrays Thomas Jefferson during the five year period from 1784 to 1789 when Jefferson served as a diplomat stationed in Paris. In 1785, Thomas Jefferson became the United States Minister to France, at the dawn of the French Revolution.The story begins decades later in the Midwestern United States where a journalist has traveled considerable distance to interview Jefferson's wayward son Madison Hemings (James Earl Jones). Hemings reveals many details, primarily that Jefferson died bankrupt. His mother Sally and his uncle James were actually the half siblings of Jefferson's late spouse Martha.Although not depicted in film, Jefferson's father-in-law John Wales was a Virginia slave trader, attorney and statesman. Wales had bequeathed his estate and his slaves to Jefferson upon his death in 1773. Also not depicted, Martha and Thomas Jefferson had six children of which only two daughters survived to adulthood.Jefferson arrives in Paris with his eldest surviving daughter, Martha ""Patsy"" Jefferson (Gwyneth Paltrow) and enrolls her into the care of an academy for girls. The academy is part of the Catholic Church and as a Protestant, Jefferson's daughter Patsy is regarded among other Non-Catholic girls to remain of her own beliefs and free will.Jefferson's presence in Europe finds him representing the United States with an insolvent Congress and significant debt to the French military for their support and alliance during the American Revolution. He is introduced in time to many dignitaries including the adversarial Ambassador to Britain (Anthony Valentine), and the Monarchs of France, King Louis XVI (Michael Lonsdale) and Queen Marie Antoinette (Charlotte de Turckheim). Jefferson also appeals to Dutch bankers and requests substantial loans to keep the American Government viable.The costumes and pageantry of the French elite seem to be rather parody at times but the film supports the pivotal moments, of the one individual who achieved most of America's success in world history. This film would be superb viewing for high school and college students. A challenge of maturity to look beyond the prissy male aristocrats and search for the more important political victories and failures.The pageantry emphasizes stark contrast between the French elite and the common people. Most of the subjects of the French Empire are starving and frustrated peasants. The king and queen appear frequently at intervals, but appear to remain alive in France during Jefferson's tenure as a U.S. Ambassador. The common people also appear often while the French Revolution progressively gains momentum.James Hemings (Seth Gilliam) is an educated slave and manservant. He is assigned to work among scholar chefs in Jefferson's kitchen and home. His young French colleagues introduce him to distilled spirits which he rejects at first claiming to have no money, but is offered anyhow.As there are no slaves in France. James approaches Jefferson about being compensated and Jefferson agrees. James continues to indulge and soon has a reputation for spending all of his money. United States laws prohibit the education of slaves but James proves already to be highly learned. James follows his ears as his duties to and from the presence of Jefferson and other statesmen increase his knowledge that he is not a slave in France.Patsy becomes homesick and depressed like her father. She pleas for Jefferson to send for his younger daughter Polly. Patsy vows to care for Polly as would a sister and a mother. Polly (Estelle Eonnet) arrives in Paris with Jefferson's teenage slave and maidservant Sally Hemings (Thandy Newton).Nick Nolte performs a superb portrayal of Thomas Jefferson as a vibrant statesman and a passionate human being. He is attracted to and pursued by Maria Cosway (Greta Scacchi), the wife of nobleman Richard Cosway (Simon Callow). Jefferson's flights of fancy with Maria result in his sustaining injury (broken wrist) while horseback riding.Director James Ivory brings the audience intimately into Jefferson's dreams, nightmares and human nature. Jefferson is a widower battling with depression who's physical and emotional pain are dynamically illustrated in cinema. Sally's loyal servitude and tenderness build an undeniable love and affection between these two human beings.Time and circumstance arise up toward confrontation among all the women in Jefferson's complicated life. As a motion picture, ""Jefferson in Paris"" is a strong, meaningful and amazing visual experience.Many viewers of this film may jump to the obvious conclusions of slavery, polygamy and children born out of wedlock, particularly the multi-racial children of American slaves. But Thomas Jefferson confronts everything from family to politics with courage and charisma.Jefferson's stature is invincible. When he is confronted with Sally's pregnancy by her brother James, he calls in the presence of his eldest daughter Patsy to hold the Holy Bible while Jefferson swears a solemn oath to eventually emancipate James and Sally in due time, after they return to Virginia.The film ends with printed credits about Jefferson's political future and his controversial relationship with Sally Hemings.The remainder of this synopsis is not depicted in film but is important to consider...Jefferson returned to Virginia in 1789 with his two daughters: Patsy and Pollly; and his two slaves Sally and James.Immediately upon his return, President Washington wrote to him asking him to accept a seat in his Cabinet as Secretary of State. Jefferson accepted the appointment serving from 1790 - 1793. Jefferson ran for President in 1796. As the Democratic-Republican presidential candidate, Jefferson lost to John Adams, but had enough electoral votes to become Vice President (1797-1801).A new revolution in 1800, Thomas Jefferson and Arron Burr were elected in a tied number of electoral votes. In February of 1801, after thirty-six ballots, the House elected Jefferson President and Burr Vice President. Jefferson owed his election victory to the South's inflated number of Electors, which counted slaves under the three-fifths compromise. Jefferson was sworn in by Chief Justice John Marshall at the new Capitol in Washington DC.Unlike Washington, who arrived at his inauguration in a stagecoach drawn by six cream colored horses, Jefferson arrived alone on horseback without guard or escort. He was dressed in plain attire and, after dismounting, retired his own horse to the nearby stable.As president, Jefferson used his influence to bring Ohio into the Union in 1802, the first state under the Northwest Ordinance prohibiting slavery. In Congress, Jefferson had authored the Ordinance of 1787 in Congressional committee under the Articles of Confederation. He was therefore instrumental in prohibiting slavery not only to new territories, but in the new states to come beginning with Ohio.In 1803, Jefferson authorized the Louisiana Purchase, a major land acquisition from France that doubled the size of the United States. His diplomatic and missionary duties to the United States of America while serving five years in Europe created a catalyst that solidified the new world.President for two four year terms. Jefferson was a peaceful leader, but as Commander in Chief he responded swiftly against the Ottoman Empire. He refused to pay the high tributes demanded by the Barbary states while they were seizing American merchant ships and enslaving the crews for high ransoms. It was the first declared war the United States fought on foreign land and seas. The United States Marine Corps conquest on the shores of Tripoli were under the command of President Thomas Jefferson.Jefferson rose up to many challenges for which he struggled financially both in government and in person. Standing nearly 6 foot 3 inches, Jefferson was a big, tall and compelling man who's physical presence and academic genius made him a powerful and respected acquaintance, friend and ally in the enlightened free world.Biographer James Parton said Thomas Jefferson could ""calculate an eclipse, survey an estate, tie an artery, plan an edifice, try a cause, break a horse, dance a minuet, and play the violin (which he does repeatedly in this film)."" Actor Nick Nolte's cinematic image sustains well in everything ever wrote about Thomas Jefferson, the most incredible man of his time.Thomas Jefferson epitomized revolutionary ideals. The film ""Jefferson in Paris"" presents Thomas Jefferson as a very elegant yet simple man who's diplomacy and rhetoric, prevailed masterfully above and beyond his character imperfections.Thomas Jefferson was the most talented copywriter and calligrapher of his time... maybe of all time, considering his eloquently beautiful compositions. He was the principal author of The Declaration of Independence.One of the most amazing visualizations of the film ""Jefferson in Paris"" is his use of an ingenious linkage of hinged wood armatures, which accurately follows his writing on a second page, with a second pen and inkwell.

"One of the obsessive speculations in American history is whether Thomas Jefferson, in the years before he became president, had an affair with (and fathered a child with) his 15-year-old slave Sally Hemings.

"Reading of the brutal murder of an entire family on a farm in Holcomb, Kansas, startles Truman Capote, a reporter for The New Yorker magazine, and he goes there to cover the story. What he finds is a murder without an identifiable motive, and, shortly thereafter, two men on death row for the murders who couldn't be more different. He befriends Perry, one of the two, and is befuddled to find an erudite, sensitive man, and Capote struggles to understand how such a man could be guilty of such crimes. Still, there is little doubt of Perry's guilt, for Dick, Perry's far less cultivated accomplice,has spoken of the murders in Capote's presence, though not admitting the murders were premeditated, and Perry makes no attempt to deny his participation.Capote is so troubled and fascinated by the murders that he resolves to write a book about the incident. The problem is that the quality of his book will suffer unless he can learn what really happened on the night the crimes took place, as he would be unable to answer the very question that compelled him to devote so much time and effort to studying the murders.Capote grows closer and closer to Perry, and their growing relationship and Capote's obsession with the successful completion of his project appear to motivate his attempt to intervene in the case and delay Perry's execution. In his prison visits to see Perry, he must delude him into believing that he is trying to get him a new trial and a fresh chance at acquittal. In truth, Capote's actions are self-serving, but the result is that he and Perry grow closer, and, eventually, Perry relates what really happened the night of the murders. An armed robbery went wrong, and the murders had been committed in the rage of the moment by Perry, who had been goaded by his accomplice, Dick, to kill all possible witnesses to their crime. Now in possession of the truth, Capote withdraws from the scene, perhaps understanding that the executions will now provide the final chapter of his book.Not long after, Perry and Dick are executed, but Capote has already succeeded in understanding the Holcomb murders, and is ready to write a novel that will be celebrated as a masterpiece."

"Famed writer Truman Capote, southern born and bred but now part of the New York City social circle, is growing weary of his current assignment of writing autobiographical type pieces for the New Yorker. After reading a newspaper article about the just occurred November 14, 1959 cold blooded murders of the Clutter family in their rural Kansas home, Truman feels compelled to write about that event as his next article. So he and his personal assistant Nelle Harper Lee, also a southern born New Yorker and an aspiring writer of her own, head to Kansas to research the story first-hand. Truman hopes to use his celebrity status to gain access to whomever he needs, such as to Laura Kinney, a friend of the Clutter daughter she who discovered the bodies, and to Alvin Dewey, the lead police investigator and also a Clutter family friend. If his celebrity doesn't work, Truman will grease the wheels by whatever means necessary. When the police eventually charge suspects, two young men named Dick Hickcock and Perry Smith, Truman uses those same tactics to gain access to them. Truman's fascination with the story makes him believe that he can revolutionize writing by expanding the germ of the article into what he calls a non-fiction novel. His personal involvement also changes as he grows emotionally attached to Perry, the seemingly sensitive and thus probable submissive in the criminal pairing, thus Truman becoming part of the story itself. Article or non-fiction novel, Truman knows that he has to take it to its natural conclusion, something which he cannot force. But also missing are the details of the November 14, 1959 event itself, something that neither Dick or Perry have divulged even in testimony.::Huggo"
"In 1959, Truman Capote, a popular writer for The New Yorker, learns about the horrific and senseless murder of a family of four in Holcomb, Kansas. Inspired by the story material, Capote and his partner, Harper Lee, travel to the town to research for an article. However, as Capote digs deeper into the story, he is inspired to expand the project into what would be his greatest work, In Cold Blood. To that end, he arranges extensive interviews with the prisoners, especially with Perry Smith, a quiet and articulate man with a troubled history. As he works on his book, Capote feels some compassion for Perry which in part prompts him to help the prisoners to some degree. However, that feeling deeply conflicts with his need for closure for his book which only an execution can provide. That conflict and the mixed motives for both interviewer and subject make for a troubling experience that would produce an literary account that would redefine modern non-fiction.::Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com)"

One of those specific incidents is at his deathbed where he is with his long time companion Jerusaleme. Caravaggio demonstrates what is important in his life as he makes a definitive choice in a symbol into his death. The other incidents are largely framed by the other major relationships in his life, including with: Cardinal Del Monte, his main conduit with the Catholic church with which he had a financially lucrative relationship; Ranuccio, a street fighter who was one of his frequent models; and Lena, Ranuccio's lover who also acted as his model.

"An opening crawl states that in the Victorian era of the early 1860s a young Englishwoman accepted the post of teaching English to the children of the King of Siam that strange and still half-barbaric country.Anna Owens (Irene Dunn), a proper widowed Englishwoman arrives by boat in Siam with her son Louis and her servants. She talks with the boat's captain about the country. He tells her the King's palace is known as the Universe, a single Sun with a thousand moons - the sun being the King and the moons being his many women, including a harem. Chow Koon (Lee J. Cobb), the Prime Minister, arrives at the dock to meet her and through his translator, asks her about her late husband and what he did. She tells him his only concern should be with her capacity as governess. His translator tells her she will be taken to the palace. She argues that she was promised a house of her own upon her arrival. He responds if she won't go to the palace, she can go wherever she pleases. Then they simply leave. Anna is offended and says he was rude, but the Captain explains that in Siam they ask personal questions to be polite. And the fact that he came to meet her in person was a sign of respect - women ""do not exist"" in this country. He suggests she tells him she didn't understand and apologize to him in the morning.She stays the night on the boat and arrives on foot at the palace the next morning, politely asking to see the Minister. She apologizes for her behavior the night before. He asks through the translator if she is really sorry or just being polite to ask for a favor. She admits it's both - she needs his help to get started in her job. Her son Louis comments that he's not wearing a coat and that he's afraid of him. Chow Koon laughs and begins talking to them in English. He admits he likes the boy and acts more friendly. He asks why she cannot live in the palace instead of having her own house. She replies that she needs time alone with her son after her duties are done. Chow believes that the King promised her a house, but says the King does not always remember his promises, and that if he reminds him it might make His Majesty angry. Anna says she will be glad to tell the King about it herself. The Minister tells her the King's busy schedule and that she might have to wait for days to see him. He will arrange the meeting, and comments it should be very interesting.She begins to unpack in the palace and her female servant is concerned that she was told her husband Moonshe cannot stay with her. When Anna tries to leave for dinner, there are female guards blocking the door. She discovers she is being housed in the harem of the palace.A month or so passes and the day of her meeting with the King finally arrives. Chow Koon has her shown the method of greeting the King - descending on the floor and then crawling on her hands and knees. Anna refuses and shows him how she and her son will bow. He tells her she can do what she wishes, but remember she is not the only one with a temper. After waiting for a time she is brought in, only to be told the King will not have time to see her. She refuses to wait and barges up to him along with Louis. ""Who, Who, Who?"" asks the irritated King (Rex Harrison) upon seeing her. She is announced as the governess. He says she does not look like a scientific person to teach a school and asks her how old she is, so she responds 150. He tries to challenge her on that comment with other questions like when she was born and how long she's been married. Finally he stumps her by asking how many grandchildren she has, which she cannot think up a quick answer to. ""I make better questions that you make answers"", he laughs, almost like an amused child. He asks if she is not afraid to tell him something is not his business. She says it would not be a compliment to His Majesty to be afraid of him. Not being afraid is good in a scientific mind, he agrees. He is pleased and brings her into another chamber to meet his wives and children - he has several wives and 67 children in all. He tells her to begin teaching his children and any of his wives who have sense to learn on the next Thursday. Then he asks Chow Koon why she was not presented to him sooner!The next day as she prepares for school, the king arrives upset. He complains that the newspaper called him a spare man, but he insists he is very necessary. She explains that spare has two meanings - one is thin. Instead of being relieved, he is upset that a woman has corrected him. ""How can King be wrong and woman be right?"" he chides. He decides to cancel the class, so she instead asks about the house he promised her. He tells her she is just a slave and it is his pleasure that she resides in the palace. She storms off, even as he angrily tells her to come back. She packs to leave, only to have one of the King's men arrive and tell her that the King has decided to give her a house. But the place she is taken to is little more than a run-down shack. She refuses it, but she decides to stay in Siam anyway, insisting he will give her a real house before she leaves if she has to stay there the rest of her life!She starts teaching the children the next day with the help of Lady Thiang (Gale Sondergaard), a woman who learned English from missionaries. A month passes, and as the king examines his daily assortment of gifts, one of them turns out to be a beautiful young woman named Tuptim, (Linda Darnell) a gift from the governor of Lao Province. He also finds a model of a house marked ""Made in England"" with the inscription ""A man's house is only less dear to him than his honor."" He also finds that his children are learning sayings like ""A promise deferred is justice delayed"", and Miss Owens is teaching them to sing, ""There's no place like home.""Later, his Prime Minister tells him they have lost Cambodia. France has made a treaty with the country and declared it independent of Siam and under their protection. The King realizes that outside forces are trying to break up his country, but he does not wish to fight; he wants to hold the country together and keep what is left safe. Chow Koon laments that he never should have asked his friend to leave the monastery he was living in and become King. He wonders what they should do. When the King hears ""Home, Sweet Home"" being played again he tell his minister thats a sign to never give up on anything. He orders Chow Koon to find Anna a house.The house the governess is given now is much nicer and she is pleased with it. But she tells Chow Koon that now that she has been given the house she was promised, she is leaving. She won't stay in a country where promises mean nothing. She tries to leave for the boat, but Chow has her dragged away to his house. But there he asks her politely to stay. He tells her the King is two men - one a king, one a man trying to modernize his country quickly and being rejected by some of his people as he does so. The conflict between the two makes it hard to know how to act. He says someone like her is needed because she can speak to the King both as a woman and someone he respects, and he will listen to her because she is not trying to gain his favor. Anna is touched by his concern and agrees to stay.At a class later on, Tuptim arrives with a monkey on her shoulder. Anna insists that she take the monkey away, threatening to report her to the king. She takes the monkey outside, but challenges her to report her anyway. Lady Thiang warns Anna that Tuptim is the King's new favorite now. The teacher later finds out that Lady Thiang is the mother of one of her best students - the King's eldest son Prince Chulalongkorn. When she goes to find Louis, she discovers he is having a disagreement with the prince, who heard him apologize to his mother and thought this was unmanly. Anna explains that she is like a father to Louis, and thus he does not resent being corrected by her just as the prince accepts criticism from his own father. The prince admits he is glad it is not like that is his country, but he respects Louis once again.One night, Anna is summoned by the King in the middle of the night. But he only called her to complain that he thinks Moses is a fool, because he said the world was created in only six days. While walking back to her house, she hears a baby crying and sees Lady Tuptim's slave chained to a post with her baby in her arms. Anna speaks to Tuptim the next day on the slaves behalf, explaining that the woman tried to buy her freedom and she does not understand why she refused to let her go - even though the law of Siam says she must. Tuptim is unhappy about her own situation so she does not see why her slave her slave should be allowed to be happy. Anna goes to the king to talk about it, but he has already heard about it from Tuptim and doesn't wish to be bothered. She explains that no one, even the King, is above the law - it must apply to all people, even if they are the King's favorite. Otherwise the word of the King would mean nothing and could be overturned by his successor. They talk about Queen Victoria and President Lincoln, but he will not comment any further on Tuptim's slave. However, the next morning, Tuptim shows Anna a gift the king gave her in exchange for freeing the slave. But when Anna lets it slip that she talked to the king, Tuptim realizes he gave her the gift at the teacher's suggestion. She feels she is no longer the King's favorite and angrily smashes the gift.Again Anna is summoned by the King, this time while eating lunch. Sir Edward Ramsey is coming to visit and His Majesty wants the Englishwoman to prepare his prettiest women for presentation in the European fashion, in order to have Ramsey report back to Queen Victoria that he is not a barbarian as other visitors to England have claimed that he is. She suggests that he set up consulates in his country so that other country can see for real what the Siamese are like, instead of hearing stories from sea captains and such. He rejects the idea, but then later summons her with the same suggestion, except he adds that they should all meet over dinner first. The dinner is held the following Saturday. The people are impressed with the King's knowledge of America and Abraham Lincoln. He tells them Siam is aware of what is happening all over the globe. Afterward, he has Anna summoned late that night. He is eating now and tells her he was too nervous and afraid to eat at the dinner, but feels fine now that everything has gone well. He gives her a gift as a reward, and shares his meal with her.At class the next day, no one is there. Curious, Anna asks Lady Thiang what is happening. Lady Thiang tells her that Lady Tuptim had escaped from the palace but has been recaptured fleeing from a monastery along with a young man. She says her trial is already taking place, and Anna goes to help her. At the trial (which is more of an inquest), Tuptim tries to explain that the young monk is indeed a young man she was once betrothed to her as a young girl, but that he did not know who she was and she had remained dressed like a man at all times. She had just wanted to be near him again. They insist instead that he knew who she was and that she made him break his priestly vows. She insists her story is true and they begin to flog her. Anna makes them stop and insists she will get the King to release her.She goes to the King but he does not care what happens to Tuptim anymore, since she offended him by running away. She begs him not to take revenge against this girl. She says if he does so, he will prove that all his improvements meant nothing. When he will not relent, she tells him that he is a barbarian. He tells her how would she like it if he made her watch what he does to Tuptim. Anna runs off, fearful of the King for the very first time. A short time later, Tuptim and the young man are burned at the stake together. She dies screaming that he had not sinned and neither had she.Soon after, Anna prepares to leave and says her good-byes to all the children. But the king's wives, whom she also taught, read a letter they wrote begging her to stay. She goes to see Lady Thiang, asking why she had been avoiding her. The Lady points to her wallpaper showing several pictures depicting her own life. First there are two trees representing her and the king, as she was his first wife. Then other pictures show other trees coming between them - his other wives. The king tree grows tall to reach the sky, but loses all its leaves and casts no comforting shadow. Her tree ends up drooping and small; she is unable to help him. Finally a smaller tree grows beside her that she tries in vain to protect from the harsh sun; this represents her son. She says she knows now that her son will become the same as the King, vain and arrogant, rather than a kinder, gentler person as Anna could have taught him to be. Lady Thiang will now remember Anna's failure every time she looks at her son.Shortly afterward, Louis Owens is out riding when his horse stumbles causing the boy to fall and be killed. Anna is devastated. The King sends his consolations to Anna via the Prime Minister, writing that September the 12th will be declared a national day of mourning for her son, and that Anna is to be appointed as Lady Kroo Yai. Chow Koon explains that the letter is an apology not only about her son, but about Tuptim as well. This is the first time he has ever tried to say he is sorry. She tells Chow to please thank the king for her. Prince Chulalongkorn comes to see her and shows her the jackknife Louis gave to him as a parting gift. He offers to return it, but she tells him he can keep it. He says he did not give Louis anything but wishes to give her a gift in his place - a white elephant. He says it is strong and will look after her. She says if he gives her the elephant, who will look after him? ""You really need someone to look after you,"" she says tearfully. They hug, and she realizes she cannot leave him.The King again summons Anna, concerned that she is not taking her medicine. She thanks him for all he has done since her son's death. He asks if she will help him with important correspondence that he has no time to read. She says tearfully that shed like to just stay on with her school. It's the children she wants to help. He agrees.She returns to teach school and stays afterward to answer any questions. One of the King's men comes by saying the King is begging for her help with his correspondence. She goes to see him and sees how frustrated he is, so she agrees to help him as well. Years pass, where consulates are set up for other countries and the Prince becomes a full-grown man with Anna there helping through it all. One day the king's man, now very old himself, summons her very despondently. The Prime Minister tells her that the King is very ill, likely dying. She goes into the library, where he is collapsed on a small bed. He has a letter to read to her, but then tells her in his own words instead. He is glad that she always told him the truth even when he didn't want to hear it. She has helped raised his children to be better men than he was, and he is grateful. He doesn't want to die without telling her of his gratitude, great respect, and confidence in her that grew larger every day. Then he dies peacefully.""He tried so hard,"" she admits, ""but he was afraid to ask for help."" She wonders what she will do now. The Prime Minister suggests that she should stay and help the Prince. She stays on. The Prince is crowned the new King. His first message is that the ancient national custom of people being on their knees before the King is abolished and that all should stand in front of the king instead as men should do. His subjects all rise up gratefully, as he promises this will be the first of many positive changes to help unite his country. Lady Thiang looks at Anna with gratitude, as does the new King."

"The story focuses on Scottish writer J. M. Barrie, his platonic relationship with Sylvia Llewelyn Davies, and his close friendship with her sons, who inspire the classic play Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up.Following the dismal reception to his latest play, Little Mary, Barrie meets the widowed Sylvia and her four young sons in Kensington Gardens, and a strong friendship develops between them. He proves to be a great playmate and surrogate father figure for the boys, and their imaginative antics give him ideas which he incorporates into a play about boys who do not want to grow up, especially one named after troubled young Peter Llewelyn Davies. His wife Mary, who eventually divorces him, and Sylvia's mother Emma du Maurier, object to the amount of time Barrie spends with the Llewelyn Davies family. Emma also seeks to control her daughter and grandsons, especially as Sylvia becomes increasingly weak from an unidentified illness.Producer Charles Frohman skeptically agrees to mount Peter Pan despite his belief it holds no appeal for upper-class theatergoers. Barrie peppers the opening night audience with children from a nearby orphanage, and the adults present react to their infectious delight with an appreciation of their own. The play proves to be a huge success.Because Sylvia is too ill to attend the production, Barrie arranges to have an abridged production of it performed in her home. She dies shortly afterward, and Barrie finds that her will is to have him and her mother to look after the boys; an arrangement agreeable to both."
The story of Sir J.M. Barrie's friendship with a family who inspired him to create Peter Pan.::Kenneth Chisholm
"1903 London. Renowned playwright J.M. Barrie (James)'s latest effort has garnered less than positive reviews, something he knew would be the case even before the play's mounting. This failure places pressure on James to write another play quickly as impresario Charles Frohman needs another to replace the failure to keep his theater viable. Out for a walk with his dog in part to let his creative juices flow, James stumbles upon the Llewelyn Davies family: recently widowed Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (the daughter of now deceased author George L. Du Maurier) and her four adolescent sons. James and the family members become friends, largely based on he and the boys being able to foster in each other the imagination of children, James just being the biggest among them in this regard. Sylvia also welcomes James into their lives, he who becomes an important and integral part of it. Among the six of them, the only one who does not want to partake is Sylvia's third, Peter Llewelyn Davies, who is still grieving the reality of their lives, where his father was there one day planning an outing for the family, and gone the next. Two other people who don't appreciate James in the Llewelyn Davies' lives are: his wife, Mary Barrie, who always feels the need to be the responsible one in their relationship and who feels threatened by his friendship with an unmarried woman; and Emma du Maurier, Sylvia's overbearing mother, who sees him as an obstacle to Sylvia moving on with her life with another potential husband, and an impediment to maintaining discipline within the boys. James still hopes to bring Peter out of his self-imposed shell, but in the process comes up with an idea for another play based on an amalgam of himself and Peter, that play which eventually becomes what Charles sees as a largely unmountable and thus doomed production called ""Peter Pan"". This process of helping Peter could take a step backward when it looks like Sylvia may imminently befall a similar fate to that of her late husband.::Huggo"
"This charming account of a period in the life of author J.M. Barrie reveals the real relationships and events that served as the basis for the author's most iconic work, ""Peter Pan."" After Barrie develops a platonic relationship with the widowed Sylvia and her four sons, he is inspired to write a play about a group of children who don't want to grow up. The work proves a hit and winds up bringing Barrie and the children together in a way he had never expected.::Jwelch5742"
"The movie details the experiences of ""Peter Pan"" author J.M. Barrie, which lead him to write the children's classic. He got to know four children who have no father. Drawing from his time with the kids, he writes a story about children who don't want to grow up.::Jan Wilm"
"London, 1903: four lads, three women, and J.M. Barrie in the year he writes ""Peter Pan."" After one of his plays flops, Barrie meets four boys and their widowed mother in the park. During the next months, the child-like Barrie plays with the boys daily, and their imaginative games give him ideas for a play. Simultaneously, a friendship deepens with Sylvia, the lads' mother, to the chagrin of his wife Mary, with whom he spends little time (separate bedrooms); the widow's mother; and high society, which gossips about his attraction to the widow and to her sons. As Sylvia's health worsens, Barrie's ties to the boys strengthen and he must find a way to take his muse to Neverland.::<jhailey@hotmail.com>"
"In this drama, we are told the story of how J.M. Barrie came up with the play Peter Pan. After some failed attempts at creating a well written play, Barrie finds himself in a park playing with his dog. Several moments later he will come to meet the inspiration for his next play, four small boys and a widowed mother, who seems to be growing weaker by the day. Soon, the whole town is talking about Barrie and the Davies family, which causes some rough waters in his marriage. But what comes from his experiences is the play that comes to be known as Peter Pan.::thexotherxchris"
"In 1903, in England, the play writer J.M. Barrie has a complete lack of inspiration, and his last work was a deceptive play. When he meets the children of the widow Sylvia Llewelyn Davies, he becomes friend of the family and Sylvia becomes his muse and her children the source of inspiration. James writes the successful play about ""Peter Pan and Neverland"".::Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"
A reporter hired to write the 'official' biography of Ty Cobb discovers just how dark the baseball legend's real story is.::Jean-Marc Rocher <rocher@tss.yh.nec.co.jp>
"Al Stump is a famous sports-writer chosen by Ty Cobb to co-write his official, authorized 'autobiography' before his death. Cobb, widely feared and despised, feels misunderstood and wants to set the record straight about 'the greatest ball-player ever,' in his words. However, when Stump spends time with Cobb, interviewing him and beginning to write, he realizes that the general public opinion is largely correct. In Stump's presence, Cobb is angry, violent, racist, misogynistic, and incorrigibly abusive to everyone around him. Torn between printing the truth by plumbing the depths of Cobb's dark soul and grim childhood, and succumbing to Cobb's pressure for a whitewash of his character and a simple baseball tale of his greatness, Stump writes two different books. One book is for Cobb, the other for the public.::Tad Dibbern <DIBBERN_D@a1.mscf.upenn.edu>"
