"The opening crawl reveals that Han Solo's friends are engaged in a mission to rescue the smuggler from Jabba the Hutt and that the Galactic Empire is building a new armored space station which is even larger and more powerful than the first Death Star.Near the forest moon of Endor the new Death Star is being constructed in orbit and a command star destroyer arrives and launches a shuttle with a fighter escort -- a shuttle bearing the Dark Lord of the Sith. Fearing his arrival the commander of the new Death Star informs Darth Vader (David Prowse voice: James Earl Jones) that the station will be operational on schedule but when Vader challenges this ""optimistic"" appraisal of the situation the commander admits that he needs more men to accelerate construction. Darth Vader however informs the commander that the Emperor (Ian McDiarmid) will be arriving soon and that he is most displeased with the commander's progress. Shaken the commander commits to redoubling construction efforts. Vader pleased remarks ""the Emperor is not as forgiving as I am.""Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) return to Tatooine to rescue Han Solo (who was encased in carbonite at the end of Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)) from the gangster Jabba the Hutt (voice: Larry Ward). Luke sends C-3PO and R2-D2 to Jabba's desert palace to deliver a message: In a hologram projected by R2 Luke offers to bargain with Jabba for Solo himself -- if Jabba does not he will be destroyed. Jabba laughs at the message and refuses to give up his ""favorite decoration:"" Han frozen in carbonite hangs on a wall in Jabba's court. The two droids are sent to EV-9D9's workshop where C-3P0 is given the job of Jabba's translator and R2 will be a drink-server on Jabba's sail barge.Disguised as a bounty hunter named Boushh Leia arrives in Jabba's court with Chewbacca in cuffs. She offers him to Jabba for a sizable bounty. After Leia dickers with Jabba over the amount and threatens him with a small thermal detonator Jabba happily agrees to pay impressed with the bounty hunter's nerve and Chewbacca is imprisoned.That night Leia sneaks into Jabba's court and frees Han from the carbonite. However she and Solo are both captured by Jabba. Solo is imprisoned with Chewbacca and Jabba keeps Leia on display in a metal bikini and chains. Luke arrives with a final ultimatum to release Solo. Jabba again refuses and drops Luke through a trap door into a pit below his throne that houses the rancor a fearsome beast that Jabba keeps for executions. As Leia watches in horror she sees Lando Calrissian disguised as a palace guard. After a brief battle Luke defeats the rancor enraging Jabba who declares that Luke Solo and Chewbacca will be slowly consumed by the sarlacc -- a huge shark-toothed tentacled maw at the bottom of the Great Pit of Carkoon.The group is taken to the pit on Jabba's sail barge fleet and Jabba sadistically attempts to draw out the spectacle by inviting them to grovel for their lives. Han and Chewbacca refuse but Luke calmly notes to the gangster that he is about to pay dearly for his arrogance to Jabba's scoffing amusement. The group is prepared for execution: Luke is the first pushed out onto a thin plank over the pit. Luke gives R2 a short salute and drops off the plank only to spin and grab the plank to launch himself back on board. At that moment R2 catapults a small object Luke's new lightsaber to the Jedi's hand. A battle erupts with Luke steadily taking the fight to Jabba's men. During the battle Leia strangles Jabba with the chain around her neck and with R2-D2's help escapes from her bonds. Solo accidentally knocks Boba Fett (Jeremy Bulloch) into the sarlacc pit. Lando is also thrown off one of the skiffs hanging by a few cables until he's rescued from the sarlacc itself by Han and Chewbacca. Luke having fought his way onto Jabba's sail barge has the escaping Leia aim the deck cannon at the vehicle and sets it on automatic fire; the sail barge soon blows apart. Our heroes manage to escape before it explodes retrieve R2 and C-3PO and zip off into the desert. Luke flies off Tatooine in his X-Wing fighter and the rest of the band fly away in the Millennium Falcon to rendezvous with the Rebel fleet near Sullust.A massive fleet of fighters completely surrounds the boarding bays of the Death Star at the arrival of the Emperor. As Red Guards slowly descend from the Imperial shuttle and flank its ramp Vader and the Death Star commander kneel to their master the last to enter the hangar. He insists that Lord Vader will soon capture Luke Skywalker and Luke will learn of the dark side of the Force when brought before Palpatine himself.Luke returns to Dagobah to complete his Jedi training but he finds Yoda (voice: Frank Oz) is ill. He tells Luke that no further training is required and all that remains to be done is to confront Darth Vader. Luke attempts to get independent confirmation of Darth Vader's claim to be Luke's father but Yoda is evasive. Finally Luke begs Yoda to tell him the truth and Yoda emotional torture clearly evident on his normally serene features confirms Luke's darkest fears. He correctly infers that Vader has used this information as an emotional weapon against Luke and criticizes Luke for having faced Vader prematurely with nearly disastrous consequences. He reminds Luke of the true nature of the Force and of the soul-corrupting nature of the dark side. Yoda then issues a dark warning telling Luke how his father fell to the shadow: he was corrupted by the powers and influence of the Emperor. If Luke allows himself to be manipulated by this dark mind then he too shall become what he most fears.Finally Yoda charges Luke with keeping alive the teachings and knowledge of the Jedi and the Force urging him to start with his own family with whom the Force is unusually strong. With his final breath Yoda tells Luke that there is ""another Skywalker."" Yoda dies at peace and before Luke's astonished eyes his body vanishes passing with his spirit into the Force. The spirit of Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) confronts a distraught Luke confirming that Vader was once Anakin Skywalker a Jedi who was turned to the dark side of the Force. Obi-Wan confesses to Luke that he made mistakes in Anakin's training especially by not deferring to Yoda and takes responsibility for indirectly creating the evil Darth Vader. Luke counters that even now all is not lost that some part of Anakin remains if only someone can reach it. When Luke asks about the other Skywalker Obi-Wan tells him that Luke has a twin sister hidden from Anakin and separated from Luke at birth to protect them both from the Emperor. Luke intuits that his sister is Princess Leia. Obi-Wan confirms it but warns Luke that in the eyes of the Empire all bonds of love and caring are potential weaknesses to be exploited.Meanwhile the entire Rebel Alliance fleet is massing their near Sullust meeting to devise an attack strategy on the uncompleted Death Star. As part of the attack Han and his companions must land on the forest moon of Endor and deactivate the generator that projects a protective shield up to the orbiting and incomplete Death Star. The team led by Han will use a stolen Imperial shuttle and confirmation code to infiltrate the heavy security measures protecting the construction site before the rest of the Rebel fleet arrives. Luke arrives at the meeting and tells Han and Leia that he'll join them on the dangerous commando mission. The fleet's assault on the Death Star will be lead by Lando Calrissian piloting the Millennium Falcon which will fly into the core of the space station and destroy the main power generator.The team arrives at Endor in the stolen shuttle and uses the confirmation code to sneak past the Imperial fleet. Luke senses that Vader is aboard the Imperial fleet's largest ship the super-star destroyer Executor and believes he's endangering the mission. Han tells him not to worry.When they arrive on the moon the team happens across a small unit of Imperial biker scouts. Han tries to sneak up on the scouts to disarm them but draws their attention when he steps on a branch. Leia and Luke jump on speeder bikes and pursue two more scouts through the forest at high speed. They overtake them both but are separated; Leia's bike crashes into a tree after she jumps off and she falls unconscious. Luke jumps off his own bike and battles with the the scout he'd been pursuing forcing him to crash using his lightsaber. When Luke rejoins the team he finds that Leia hasn't returned. The team looks for her but is captured by indigenous creatures called Ewoks -- short furry intelligent forest dwellers. An Ewok called Wicket (Warwick Davis) befriends Leia but the other Ewoks who captured the rest of the Rebel party decide to sacrifice them to C-3P0 who they believe is a god. Luke having mastered the Force levitates C-3P0 to impress the Ewoks with the droid's power and scare them into giving up the sacrifice. With the help of C-3PO Luke and his party form an alliance with the Ewoks whose stone-age technology has unexpectedly effective military applications.Later Luke decides that the time has come for him to face Vader. He confesses to Leia that he is her brother and that he has to try to save the man who was once their father. She tells him to ignore his feelings and leave but Luke tells her that he must face his destiny and if necessary in the event that he falls she must learn the ways of the Jedi to help oppose the Emperor. Luke surrenders peacefully to Vader but fails to convince his father to abandon the dark side even though Vader is left subtly shaken by his matured son's own mind games.They go to the Death Star to meet the Emperor who reveals that the Rebel Alliance is walking into a trap. On the forest moon the Rebels led by Solo and Leia enter the shield generator control facility only to be taken prisoner by a large legion of Imperial troops. Once they are led out of the bunker however the Ewoks spring a surprise counterattack. In a desperate ground battle the Rebels and Ewoks fight the Imperial forces. Aboard the Death Star the Emperor attempts to seduce Luke with the powers of the dark side. The Emperor reveals his plan: the information that Rebel spies had stolen was part of an elaborate plan to draw out the Rebel fleet and command so they could be eliminated in one battle. As Luke's anger builds he attacks the Emperor with his lightsaber only to be stopped by Vader's crimson blade.During the strike team's assault the Rebel fleet emerges from hyperspace for the battle over Endor only to discover that the shield of the Death Star is still functioning. An intense space battle takes place as the Imperial fleet in a second part of the Emperor's plan appears and attacks the Rebel fleet. During the battle the Death Star is revealed to be operational; its superlaser revealed to be relatively rapid-fire on a low setting compared to its predecessor is fired at the Rebel fleet and obliterates a Rebel star cruiser. Though Admiral Ackbar wants to abandon the attack Lando convinces him that they must give Han and his party more time on Endor. The fleet regroups and begins to engage the Imperial fleet of star destroyers directly.On the Death Star the Emperor taunts Luke to give in to his anger. A ferocious lightsaber duel has erupted between Luke and his father. In the midst of combat Vader reads Luke's feelings and learns that Luke has a twin sister. When Vader toys with the notion of turning Leia to the dark side Luke gives in to his rage and furiously gains the upper hand in the battle slicing off Vader's right robotic hand in a rage in one swift cut and makes his father succumb to defeat at the mercy of his son's blade. Despite the Emperor's goading Luke refuses to kill his father realizing that he is traveling down his father's path towards the dark side and declares himself a Jedi. Realizing that Luke cannot be turned the Emperor uses Force lightning against him to torture and attempt to kill him. Deeply affected by the sight of his son dying before him Vader repents and turns on the Emperor throwing him down a reactor shaft to his death. At the same time however the Emperor's Force lightning causes fatal injuries to Vader (Anakin) and short-circuits his breathing system. Stopping momentarily in a landing bay Anakin asks Luke to take his mask off knowing that he'll die but desiring to look at his son's face with his human eyes. Luke removes the helmet revealing the pale and scarred face of his father (Sebastian Shaw). Anakin says that Luke was right about him and asks Luke to tell his sister. With those final words Anakin dies.Back on Endor the strike team finally destroys the shield generator. The Rebel fleet seizes the opportunity to launch a final assault on the Death Star in space. Meanwhile to by the attackers more time Admiral Ackbar orders a concentrated attack on the Imperial fleet's flagship the Executor. With a crashing rebel pilot ramming into the ship's bridge not only is Admiral Piett killed but the ship goes out of control and collides with the Death Star. Lando leads Wedge Antilles (Denis Lawson) and his fighter group into the bowels of the Death Star where they fire at the main reactor causing its collapse. Luke with the body and armor of Anakin escapes the Death Star in an Imperial shuttle. Moments later Wedge in his X-Wing and Lando in the Millennium Falcon emerge from the Death Star just as the space station explodes. On Endor Han tries to reassure Leia that Luke was likely not on the destroyed station but Leia already senses that is true. Guessing Leia's feelings for Luke Han offers to step aside for him to court her. However Leia reassures Han Solo of her love and reveals to him that Luke is actually her brother who obviously will support their own romance to Han's astonished relief. That evening Luke cremates the remains of his father in a funeral pyre on Endor. The entire galaxy celebrates the fall of the Emperor and the Rebel victory over the Empire. Luke Leia Han Lando and the rest of the rebels along with the Ewoks celebrate the victory as well. During the celebration Luke catches sight of the spirit figures of Obi-Wan Kenobi Yoda and the redeemed Anakin Skywalker who look proudly upon him."

"It has been long few months of missions for the Enterprise and they are now scouting out possible sites for a general shore leave for the crew.Sulu and McCoy are down on the surface of a planet along with Lt. Angela Martine and her boyfriend Mr Esteban and all are taking normal readings until they stumble upon WHAT?? Rabbit tracks but human sized! Kirk on the ship is asking McCoy WHAT THE HELL then McCoy sees 'Alice in Wonderland' and the 'White Rabbit' right out of the Lewis Carroll story. Harmless? We shall see.Up on the ship Spock is insisting that Kirk report for Shore Leave so he beams down with Yeoman Tonia Barrows a very pretty Yeoman with brunette hair. When they arrive Sulu is running down the hill like a madman claiming that he is being chased by a Samurai. Suddenly Yeoman Barrows screams from the bushes and runs out with her uniform half ripped down the shoulder saying it seemed like her attacker was 'Don Juan'.Spock sends an emergency call and beams himself down. He tells them that they are temporarily trapped on the planet due to a huge 'damping field' of electricity and they are stranded.Kirk meanwhile has spotted an old enemy from school named Finnegan who punches the guts out of Kirk.Then Kirk smells a nice flower and suddenly there is Ruth.""Ruth"" he says ""How can you possibly be here""? (Ruth is a very favorite love of Kirk's from his school days). She has golden hair tied in a circle of rings above her head and a chubby face and smile.McCoy and Barrows find a princess gown like those worn by medieval ladies and McCoy suggests she try it on.He is trying to answer a staticky security call from Sulu but is distracted by the sight of Yeoman Barrows changing her clothes. Suddenly there is the sound of a horse charging toward them with a black knight.McCoy refuses to believe that it is real. ""It simply cannot be real"" he says but LOOK OUT the black knight kills McCoy with his lance and Sulu who found an old Colt 45 gun shoots the knight. McCoy is dead.They examine the knight but he is made of cellulose like a plant and McCoy's body is gone!!On the hillside Esteban is pointing out to Angela a Japanese ZERO fighter plane of the type which attacked Pearl Harbor thereby forcing the U.S.A. into the Pacific Theatre of World War II in the sky. LOOK OUT!He tells her not to worry unless it begins a 'strafing' run then IT DOES!! and Angela is killed by the machine guns.Kirk sees Finnegan again and beats the brains out of him. Spock finds him and says ""Are you happy?"" Kirk smiles and says yes. Spock has an idea. He tells them all of these illusions are things that the crewmen desired to see or enemies from the past that they wanted to beat up.In order to protect themselves they must stop imagining and thinking. They gather in the field at attention.
Suddenly McCoy walks up to them (what the hell?) with an old man and a two lovely feathered dancers The old man explains to them that this is a 'pleasure planet' and he is the caretaker a Robot.As long as they guard their imaginings it is perfectly safe to have shore leave on the planet. Yeoman Tonia jealously grabs McCoy away from the feathered dancers and Angela who is also still alive grabs Esteban away too. Kirk is about to go go back to the ship when suddenly he sees Ruth and decides to stay.Spock is left to mind the ship and the entire crew is allowed to take shifts of shore leave. At the end everyone is very happy and Spock says ""illogical"". Everyone laughs and all is resolved."
The past three months has left the crew of the Enterprise exhausted and in desperate need of a break but does this explain McCoy's encounter with a human-sized white rabbit or Kirk crossing paths with the prankster who plagued his days at Starfleet Academy?::Steve Green

"This film is loosely based on H. G. Wells' ""The Invisible Man"" with Dr. Sebastian Caine (actor Kevin Bacon) taking the place of Doctor Jack Griffin (actor Claude Rains) and updates the story to the 20th Century. In this version of Wells' story the doctor is a brilliant but megalomaniacal molecular biologist and is working on an invisibility serum for the U.S. military as well as a serum that will return the subject back to visibility. Sebastian has been attempting to perfect the formula for the last four years and he conducts his experiments on animals kept inside a top-secret hidden military lab accessible only to him and his staff. His current project is reversing the invisibility effect on his test subject a female gorilla named Isabelle. Working late one night on re-configuring the molecular model of the irradiated protein that will restore Isabelle to visibility he solves the problem and immediately reports his success to the top members of his staff.Although work on the serum occupies nearly all of his waking hours Sebastian becomes obsessed with his ex-girlfriend Dr. Linda McKay (Elisabeth Shue) who is a scientist on his team. Unbeknownst to him she has become involved with Dr. Matt Kensington (Josh Brolin) another member of their research group. Sebastian and his colleagues who also include veterinarians Sarah Kennedy (Kim Dickens) and Carter Abbey (Greg Grunberg) and technicians Frank Chase (Joey Slotnick) and Janice Walton (Mary Randle) eventually enable the serum to work on the gorilla. In celebration the team goes out for a fancy dinner where Sebastian makes a toast to the greatest research group in the world. To Sebastian however it feels like the end as reversion was the last big breakthrough.Instead of reporting his success to the military Sebastian inexplicably lies to the oversight committee including his old teacher Dr. Howard Kramer (William Devane) and talks Linda and Matt into lying to the other four and going right into human testing. The subject: Sebastian himself. Despite a painful shift to transparency the procedure is successful. After being unconscious for about 17 hours due to shock Sebastian wakes up in pain and recoiling from the ambient light realizing that he can see through his eyelids. He then conducts some clinical tests on himself. But when it comes time to return to visibility after three days the reversion fails and almost kills him.The researchers construct a latex mask for the scientist to wear around the lab crudely approximating a human appearance. During this time Matt discovers a promising way to make Sebastian visible again. A computer simulation however fails. Over the next several days isolation and virtual imprisonment in the lab begin to wear on Sebastian's patience. Disobeying Carter and his own rules he heads back to his apartment to grabs some books CDs and Twinkies to take back to the lab. There temptation gets the best of him and he first spies on his neighbor (Rhona Mitra) and then rapes her while fully invisible. Linda shows up at the apartment and finds the mask and clothes but no Sebastian.Sebastian returns to the lab just as the others were planning to go after him. Linda warns him that if he leaves again she and Matt will tell Dr. Kramer what they did. Ignoring their threat he assembles a device that runs a video loop of his heat signature in his quarters; the repeating image fools Frank into believing that Sebastian is still in the lab when in fact he is out spying on Linda and Matt.Sebastian is furious that Matt and Linda are together and smashes their bedroom window. The two call Frank who tells them that Sebastian is still in bed. Meanwhile an enraged Sebastian returns to the lab frustrated and angered at the thought of Linda and Matt together. Unable to stand the annoying barking of an invisible dog Sebastian approaches the dog reassuring it that he means it no harm then kills it with his bare hands by brutally smashing it against the cage wall. The team soon discover that they have been watching a recording and that Sebastian has been leaving without their knowledge.Linda and Matt go to Dr. Kramer's house and confess about their experiments with Sebastian. Dr. Kramer is disappointed and tells them that they are fired from the project. Dr. Kramer then attempts to call the military and inform them about Sebastian but Sebastian has actually followed Linda and Matt to the house. Sebastian tricks Kramer into leaving the house and then drowns him in his own swimming pool.The next day Sebastian waits until all of the team is in the lab and then disables the phones and all of the elevator codes except for his own. He removes his clothing and latex mask and invisible begins to hunt them all down. Janice falls behind while the team searches for Sebastian and he strangles her with an IV line and stuffs her body in a locker.Linda Matt Sarah Carter and Frank learn what Sebastian is up to realizing that they are the only ones who know what he has become and therefore he is planning to kill them all. Linda Sarah and Frank hide in the lab while Matt and Carter take tranquilizer guns to go hunting for Sebastian in the empty hallways using thermographic imaging goggles. Matt shoots at a heat signature that turns out to be from a steam vent. When Matt turns around Carter has been yanked into the air by Sebastian who is on top of a pipe. Matt tries to shoot him but Sebastian throws Carter down toward a steel bar which cuts his carotid artery causing massive blood loss. Sebastian almost kills Matt but Linda drags him to safety.Sarah and Frank find the barely conscious and severely injured Carter. Sarah runs to the freezer to get blood for a transfusion despite Frank's wishes. There Sebastian corners her. She splashes the blood all over the room rendering him visible however Sebastian tackles her and shoots her with her tranquilizer dart then breaks her neck.Linda and Matt find Frank tending to a dying Carter. Carter bleeds to death and the three go to find Sarah. They find her dead in the walk-in freezer. Frank sprays a fire extinguisher to expose Sebastian but Sebastian comes from behind impales Frank with a crowbar. He then stabs Matt with the hook end however non-fatally. Sebastian locks Linda and Matt in the freezer turns the temperature control all the way down and leaves them to freeze to death.Sebastian puts on his latex mask and clothing spending much time to ensure he looks near-human. Meanwhile Linda dresses Matt's wound with duct tape and then works out a way to escape from the freezer. Linda constructs an electromagnet using a defibrillator and other lab equipment and uses it to open the door. She lights a fire to warm Matt and gathers the parts needed for a flamethrower. Sebastian goes to the lab and produces nitroglycerin to blow up the lab. He puts the nitro in a centrifuge starts a timer and destroys the keyboard so it can't be stopped. Just as he is entering the elevator to leave Linda appears and fires her crude blowtorch at him. His latex mask and clothes burning away Sebastian barely manages to escape the flames. Linda uses the flamethrower to start the ceiling sprinklers partially revealing him. The two fight; just as she is about to lose Matt appears and hits Sebastian with the crowbar. Sebastian recovers but while wet he swings the crowbar and connects with a fuse box electrocuting himself. As the electricity courses through his body Sebastian is rendered partially visible: his muscles bones and organs can be seen but his skin and what's left of his hair remain invisible.Linda and Matt find the nitro about to explode and decide to abandon the lab climbing up the elevator shaft. The lab explodes filling the shaft with fire. The two are almost out when Sebastian appears. He fights with Linda and kisses her one last time ""for old time's sake"" before she finally kills him by grabbing the elevator cable and knocking the car loose sending Sebastian plummeting into the inferno below. Eventually both Linda and Matt emerge from the burning laboratory and medics whisk them away in an ambulance.

"NOTE: Sequel to John Carpenter's Vampires (1998).Los Muertos picks up after the vampires went south into Mexico and Father Guiteau stashed the Bersier
cross in a monastery. Vampire hunter Derek Bliss [Jon Bon Jovi] has been commissioned to seek and destroy
some vampires in northern Mexico before they can move north to San Diego
and other places in the U.S. The only problem is that the unnamed client
wants to hire a team not someone working solo. Getting together a team is
a bit difficult for Derek because everyone on Chief Brody's recommended
list keeps turning up dead. Father Guiteau who was a member of the
original team lead by Jack Crow died last month. All the priests at the
monastery where he moved the Bersier cross were killed by vampires only a
day or two after Derek came looking for Guiteau.Eventually Derek manages to put together a team unlikely as it is.
It consists of Zoey [Natasha Wagner] (a woman he met in a diner who was bitten by a vampire
but who has been able to keep the turning in remission by taking some
anti-HIV pills she got in Mexico City) Father Rodrigo[Cristian de la Fuente] (the only priest
who escaped the massacre at the monastery) Sancho [Diego Luna] (a 15-year old boy who
accompanied Derek on a vampire hunt and who found that he had a penchant
for it) and Ray Collins [Darius McCrary] (a tall muscular black ex-military ""tough as
nails"" guy recruited in Memphis by Brody). To help with the hunt Rodrigo
offers Derek the use of Guiteau's vampire-hunting bus which is outfitted
with all the winches and gizmos that are needed to hunt vampires (or
""suckers"" as the team calls them).The attack on the monastery Rodrigo explains was led by the new
female master Una [Arly Jover] in order to get
back the Bersier cross. It looks like she intends to again perform the
ritual which the suckers believe will allow them to walk during the day.
After meeting up with Collins in Nogales they cross over into Mexico.
Zoey due to her blood connection with the vampires has a vision of Una
performing the ceremony but it doesn't seem to have worked. The sun still
hurts her. Given a map of Mexico Zoey is able to pinpoint where she
thinks the bloodsuckers are hiding...someplace called Salina near some
old Toltec ruins. They stop for the night to sleep but Collins is getting
claustrophobic in the little bus and chooses to sleep outside. During the
night he is unknown to anyone bitten by Una. The next day is spent
driving further into Mexico. They know that they are getting close when
they stop for gas and cold drinks and find that everyone in the diner has
been slaughtered.The next morning they near Salina. Rather than going directly to the
ruins they stop in Salina where the residents are celebrating the Day of
the Dead (""Los muertos"" means ""the dead""). When Zoey goes to take her
meds she finds them missing and says that she must go immediately to
Mexico City. Actually Una has them and she's downed every last one. This
gives Una the ability albeit it temporary to move about during daylight
and she uses that opportunity to find and kidnap Zoey. Rodrigo puts 2+2
together and concludes that Una took Zoey's meds. But the only ones who
had access to them were the rest of the team so Derek holds them all at
gunpoint trying to find the culprit. Turns out that it was Collins who
is shot by an old man they just met that morning in Salina. With his dying
breath Collins reveals that the client who hired them is none other than
Una.Although they now know that this entire vampire hunt is a set-up the
remaining team members plus the old man filling in for Collins go to the
ruins to rescue Zoey. Zoey has fallen into a deep shaft and needs to be
lifted out. Derek tosses her a rope telling the old man to stay far
enough behind him to watch his back while still keeping his eye on Rodrigo
and Sancho who are closer to the exit. While they are so separated Una
attacks Derek. Just as she's about to bite his neck Fr Rodrigo offers Una
a deal. Let his friends go and he'll offer himself as a priest to
perform the ceremony. In addition he points out he is also a hunter--two
of the necessary elements of the ritual. Una agrees.Rodrigo stays with Una while the others go to a clinic where Zoey is
transfused with blood while her infected blood is removed in hopes that
this will slow her turning. Then Derek gets a brainstorm. He asks the
nurse to transfuse Zoey's tainted blood into him so that he can slow his
heartbeat and infiltrate the vampires without being noticed.
As the sun sets the team goes back to the ruins where the ritual is
taking place. Una has slit Rodrigo's leg and drunk a cup of his blood when
Rodrigo mentions that the ritual won't work because he was merely a hired
hand at the monastery not a priest at all. Ha ha fooled you! Derek
whose plan to lurk is working shoots several suckers saves Rodrigo from
being burned alive and fires an arrow through Una. Unfortunately the
winch is on the fritz and they can't pull her out into the sun.So they
fix the winch and go back into the ruins. Sancho ropes Una Una grabs
Derek Zoey pulls both Una and Derek out into the sun Derek shoots off
Una's head and Una burns up. [I wonder whether they'll get paid now that
they've killed their client?]Epilogue: Rodrigo stays in Salina Sancho is sent home to his mother and Derek
and Zoey drive off together into the sunset headed for Mexico City as
they are both in need of those meds. [Original synopsis by bj_kuehl]"

"Synopsis - Superman and the Mole-Men
The differences between this movie and the two-part episodes on television are noteworthy not subtle but possible mitigation is accepted due to time constraints with the television episodes. The movie was fifty-eight minutes in length whereas two thirty-minute television episodes do not leave sufficient room for commercials even in the early 1950's. Looking at the movie now allows the viewer scope to include critical scenes in the TV episodes shave scenes elsewhere in order to leave less questions to be asked of the viewer. Critical scenes showing why no outside assistance was ever brought in to help law enforcement or why the entire nation was not alerted to the events in Silsby are important to be shown letting the viewer understand why things occurred the way they did. The movie was successful and it launched the television series therefore critical questions answered are most appropriate. The following synopsis includes mention of scenes omitted in the television episodes shown at the end of season one two years after the movie was made.Eddie is first to speak in the movie as rig supervisor Bill Corrigan is ordering men including Eddie to toss nearly-new tools and parts into a pit with one such part being wrapped up and tucked into the shed adjoining watchman Pop's shack. Just before our reporters get to the site something is afoot as men are not working on the rig of the deepest oil well ever drilled. Edited was Corrigan hiding something in a wrap(never did find out the item) putting it into the shed next to Pop then jumping Pop for interfering afterward apologizing saying he was just nervous about the events at hand.
Reporters arrive with news from Pop the well is closing explaining it was a company decision per Corrigan.
Clark starring at the discarded items mentioning ""I'm not so sure we won't get a story"" is a lead to a later conversation with Corrigan alone. The man escorting Clark and Lois to the site is oil company publicity man John Craig. Craig is in the dark as far as the well closing; he offers the Silsby hotel to the reporters at the oil company's expense and his car. Note Craig and Corrigan are with the reporters throughout the movie.
Back at the hotel Clark is thinking about Corrigan as he speaks to Lois about something not sitting right with Clark questioning Corrigan's demeanor that afternoon. He and Lois decide to take a drive out to the well to take another look around and maybe talk to the watchman.
The creatures release the latches from the well cap and climb out of the casing onto the platform from there they venture about before coming to Pop's shack. Edited from TV the music seemed more intense as the creatures emerged from the well; they took a longer route to Pop's shack showing them watching Pop eat while reading his magazine although the movie never did actually has Pop look at the creatures nor shows them in the shed Pop hit the floor off-camera. Pop went from his orange to a sandwich when the creatures look at him through the shed window just as the reporters are driving up in Craig's car.
Clark sees through the door and Pop lying on the shed floor. ""Great Scot"" he exclaims as he and Lois run to Pop's side. Clark confirms Pop is dead kneeling before him requesting Lois get a hold of Craig also summon Corrigan and the Sheriff. Clark goes outside of the shed notices the cap off the well examines it while Lois calls Craig and lets out a scream witnessing the creatures. Clark runs to her side comforting her he tells Craig on the phone to come to the well site with Corrigan and the Sheriff.
Everybody gathered in the shack nobody quite believing Lois' story but Pop was pronounced dead by the doc-coroner. The Sheriff says all clear around the area Lois tells Craig what she saw pleading with them to believe her. The doc-coroner declaring Pop's death a probable heart attack autopsy to confirm while Clark asks could Pop have been frightened to death? Yes responds the doc-coroner. The inquest will be on Wednesday says the Sheriff Clark says we'll be there. Lois wants out goes with Craig Clark sticks around to talk with Corrigan.
Corrigan showed Clark the sample drill cores he pulled they glow the last sample showed life the cap was off Clark tells Corrigan. The undertaker Jeff Reagan is on his way until Corrigan gets a call saying Reagan lost control of his car seeing the creatures on the road the car turned over and he was injured. Pop's death Lois' sighting Reagan's sighting all lead to the same conclusion that the creatures whatever they are are around the area and the glowing oranges spilled on the floor are more than enough for Clark and Corrigan to get back to town.
The creatures watching through the bushes men heading to town was not in the television episode. The two visitors from the well roam the area inspecting a flower dropping it leaving it to glow. They come to a house where a child is playing in her bedroom they climb in the window roll a ball among them.
News gets around when the two men pull up to the hotel and Luke Benson's hounds are identified by Corrigan speaking to Kent. A meeting of townsfolk in the hotel lobby angrily forming a vigilantly group lead by Luke Benson prompts Clark to tell all them not to act in that manner and Corrigan chimes in with ""they came up from the drill shaft out of the oil well from six miles underground"". Clark tells the crowd you reacted because you were frightened. He asks them to trust him that he will take care of it when Lois questions his sanity.
The crowds leaves the lobby when the child's mother enters and screams at the sight of the two strangers. The crowd heads toward the sound of the screams. Clark hearing the screams departs as Lois expounds to Craig and Corrigan ""he always does that gets himself in a jam and runs away.""
Superman appears at the child's house goes in exits the little girl was scared she is alright fights off Luke and the crowd disperses.
Superman Lois Corrigan and Craig go to the house window where the creatures entered. He directs the other men to wrap the two bring them to the hospital for routine decontamination explaining to Lois about the glow caused by the creatures' touch. Edited from television Lois wants to call the Planet Superman advises otherwise for the panic set forth could be devastating a nationwide form of hysteria hold off until more facts are known stop this here in Silsby before it spreads. Craig says he is right Miss Lane Lois reluctantly agrees.
The creatures are on the dam's precipice with Luke Weber and Eddie hunting them; Eddie shines his light at them aerial shots of the water below with the concrete walls were edited from the movie. Superman lands in front of the vigilantes warning about their possible radioactivity contaminating the water supply Luke fire shots at Superman knocks down Luke Weber shoots a creature he lets out a scream falls with Superman catching him mid-air. Superman lands with the wounded one and says ""I'm going to get you to a hospital.""
The chase for the other one is on with Matt getting the hounds on the scent. There is considerable more footage of the lone creature escaping from the dam encountering a vagabond at a campfire sipping water until he sees the creature and flees the area. The creature meets up with a chicken wire fence he sifts through as the mob finds a distant gate for the dogs to pass with them. The footage from leaving the dam to the tool shed is minimal in the television edit no vagabond no chicken wire less travel altogether. They did show the creature lying prone taking a breath and leaving glowing brush; Luke warning the men not to touch it. The creature comes to a tool shed rips boards away to enter and finds himself being nearly burned to death in the shed. Miraculously escaping through the floorboard as the shed is engulfed in flames.
Eddie shoots at the window while the flames are roaring but Luke is not sticking around to see the kill.
Footage seen only in the movie is the Sheriff leaving a call for the state police asking for help in controlling the mob in town as it is only he and deputy Jim available as law enforcement. Craig tries talking him into doing it himself with the help from Superman and Corrigan agrees with Craig. The Sheriff says he hasn't seen Superman since he went to the hospital with the wounded creature. Corrigan says Kent is at the hospital hasn't seen Superman but Craig says Kent and Lane are from the largest newspaper in the country think about the publicity you would get from their story if you handled yourself. The operator calls back saying still a busy signal the Sheriff says he will try them in the morning Craig tells he did the right thing.
Luke comes into the Sheriff's office bragging they got the creatures the Sheriff disagrees Superman took one to the hospital. Luke is determined to rid the town of the creatures and forces the men at gunpoint to back off he is going to hunt the creatures down once and for all.
The Sheriff and deputy are off to stop Benson and his mob Corrigan and Craig don't think they will be able to without help they go to find Kent. The Sheriff gets slugged by Luke on the hotel steps as he tries to arrest Luke the mob hauls away the Sheriff Luke and mob head to the hospital.
Clark and the doctor walk out of the operating room as Lois barks ""Clark where have you been? And what are you doing in that outfit?"" ""What are you hiding?"" she chirps at Clark. ""... you're leading a double life.""
Clark tells Lois Craig and Corrigan are running up the street she can't see them. Corrigan says Luke is on his way to get the creature Clark says he will be right back Lois accuses him of being scared to death.
A confrontation erupts between Luke and Lois Corrigan gets pistol whipped by Luke Superman appears Craig helps Corrigan in side the hospital Lois is almost struck with a shot fired she steps inside Superman relieves the mob of its weapons.
Three more creatures emerge from the well weapon in tow seeking revenge and their companion more than likely. They walk through the empty streets weapon-ready to defend themselves as the disarmed townsfolk head into the hotel. They encounter Superman weapon pointed one gesticulates cradling another Superman goes into the hospital telling all present they communicated he was the person saving their friend by the cradling motion. Superman brings out the wounded one handing over to another and blocks the weapon discharge of a pulsating light beam at Luke Benson. Luke says you saved my life and Superman retorts that's more than you deserve.
Superman helps carry the wounded one to the well entrance helping them down the casing weapon included. Corrigan tells Superman he got hold of a Geiger counter checking the woman and child and Kent was right it was just harmless phosphorescence confirmed. A light ray pulses from the capped well suddenly an explosion the derrick is burning the well and casing is being destroyed so no one will be able to get to them again. Superman Lois Craig and Corrigan stand back as the fire burns Lois says ""...you live your lives and we'll live ours."" No credits were listed at the end of the movie only those at the beginning."

Bourne gets out and holds Paz at gunpoint before sparing his life and continuing on to 415 East 71st Street memories of which were triggered by the false birthday he was given by Landy. Vosen also figures out Landy's code and warns Dr. Albert Hirsch who ran Treadstone's behavior modification program that Bourne is coming.Landy meets Bourne at the building where Bourne gives her the Blackbriar files before going inside. Vosen arrives in minutes and starts searching for Landy afraid that she might release the classifed information only to find her faxing the files to an unknown receiver just as the last page is being sent. Bourne encounters Hirsch in an upper level and with Hirsch's help remembers that he volunteered for Treadstone. He then states that he is no longer Jason Bourne and flees to the roof from Vosen's pursuing CIA team. Bourne is confronted on the roof by Paz who asks Bourne why he did not kill him. Bourne asks Paz if he even knows why he is supposed to kill him and repeats the dying words of The Professora Treadstone assassin Bourne had killed years earlier""Look at us. Look at what they make you give."" Paz lowers his gun as Bourne runs to jump off the roof but Vosen appears and shoots at Bourne as he leaps into the East River below.

Ari sees them but Leo manages to convince Ari to join a human rebellion against the apes. General Thade (Tim Roth) and Colonel Attar (Michael Clarke Duncan) send ape warriors to pursue the humans. Leo discovers Calima (the temple of ""Semos"") a forbidden but holy site for the apes.Calima it turns out is a corruption of a partially obscured sign which reads ""Caution Live Animals"" within the wreck of the Oberon Leo's former space station. It has apparently crashed on the planet's surface and appears to have been wrecked for a long time. The ship is powered by inexhaustible fuel cells and Leo is able to access computer logs. The logs show that the space station crashed thousands of years ago while searching for him. Leo deduces that when he entered the vortex he was pushed forward in time while the Oberon searching for him was not crashing on the planet long before he did.The Oberon's log reveals that the apes on board led by Semos organized a mutiny and took control of the vessel after it crashed. The human and ape survivors of the struggle left the ship and their descendants are the people Leo has encountered since landing. The apes arrive and attack the humans who have gathered to see Leo. A familiar vehicle descends from the sky and is identified immediately by Leo. The pod is piloted by Pericles the chimp astronaut. Pericles was pushed forward in time as Leo was and had just now found his way to the planet. When Pericles lands and the pod opens the apes interpret his arrival as the return of Semos the first ape who is their god. They bow and hostilities between humans and apes suddenly cease.Pericles runs into the wreck of the Oberon and Leo runs after him followed by General Thade. Thade and Leo fight. Pericles tries to help Leo but Thade throws him hard against a wall. Thade takes Leo's gun from him and tries to fire the weapon at Leo. Leo sees that Thade is within the pilot's deck and closes the automatic door trapping Thade inside. Thade fires the weapon repeatedly at the door but the ricochets create sparks that cause Thade to huddle afraid under a control panel. Leo decides to escape the Planet of the Apes and return to earth. He gives Pericles to Ari who promises to look after him. He says goodbye and kisses Daena. Leo climbs aboard Pericles's undamaged pod and travels back in time through the same electromagnetic storm. Leo crashes in Washington D.C. on Earth in his own time. He looks up to see the Lincoln Memorial is now a monument in honor of General Thade.

"By 2017 the world economy has collapsed and food oil and other natural resources are all in short supply. Unable to meet the needs of the general public the U.S. government has likewise collapsed and given way to an iron-fisted police state divided into paramilitary zones.The media is controlled by the state and all forms of communication are subject to rigid censorship. Despite the jack-booted no-tolerance suppression of dissent a resistance movement continues to survive and operate underground.A police helicopter flies through the night sky near Bakersfield California. A decorated officer and captain Ben Richards (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is piloting. Investigating a disturbance he reports a food riot composed of 1500 unarmed civilians many of them women and children. Police command issues orders for Richards to open fire on the rioters and to slaughter as many as possible. Stricken with disgust and shock Richards refuses to carry out the orders and announces a mission abort. The lieutenant that serves as second is ordered to detain Richards and proceed with the orders. Richards battles with the other officers aboard the chopper and is handling them all until he is pulled toward the back of the copter and throws an officer forward against the controls. The chopper pitches over and Richards falls out of the helicopter hanging on to the outrigger. Under orders to detain Richards alive the other officers pull him back in and bash him with a rifle butt telling him he's going to fry for this. The attack on the crowd commences and Richards is framed as the ""Butcher of Bakersfield.""Eighteen months later in the Wilshire detention zone prisoners are forced to toil at hard labor. Each inmate is fitted with a collar containing a small explosive that will detonate if the collar is tampered with or if the inmate attempts to cross beyond sonic boundary posts. Detonation of a collar is instantly fatal causing a prisoner's head to explode with the collar. Ben Richards is an inmate at the prison; the state has pinned the Bakersfield massacre entirely on him as a bloodthirsty rogue officer who disobeyed orders. A work crew is being moved to go beyond the sonic perimeter. A perimeter guard enters an access code to deactivate the perimeter just long enough for the inmates to pass through safely. Behind the guard a prisoner named Weiss (Marvin J. McIntyre) carefully looks at the guard's monitor and notes the code.A few moments later Weiss nods to Richards and a fellow inmate Laughlin (Yaphet Kotto) who start a fist-fight as a distraction. The inmates all riot killing several guards and seizing the control device for the sonic perimeter. Weiss enters the deactivation code he'd memorized but other perimeter guards have become alerted to the revolt and are using another control device to override and prevent the code from being accepted. More gunfire is exchanged as the guards try to hold the line. Weiss manages to get the code in but the sonic deadline is not up and one inmate who makes a mad rush for freedom is killed when his collar detonates. Finally the perimeter guard manning the control device that is blocking the code is also killed and the sonic perimeter is deactivated completely. All the inmates run out of the detention zone to freedom.Richards Weiss and Laughlin are walking through a barrio in Los Angeles on the outskirts of the working- and wealthy-class districts of the city. A large television screen shows a reporter droning about various zone pass regulations and a midnight curfew. The screen then switches to a game show known as 'The Running Man' which has become the most popular television program in history. The Running Man is a savage sadistic gladiator-style program where criminals are thrown into a 400-square block area of ruins left over from a major earthquake as contestants. The game zone is further divided into four quadrants that the contestants must pass through. As they struggle to run through the zone the contestants are ruthlessly pursued by 'stalkers' -- gladiators armed with lethal high-tech weaponry -- who hunt the contestants down and slaughter them. The program runs three hours each week and is co-produced by the Department of Justice broadcast on the state-run television agency known as ICS.Richards Weiss and Laughlin meet up with a contact named Stevie (Dweezil Zappa) who is part of the underground resistance movement. Stevie and his cohort Mic (Mick Fleetwood) have the technology to remove the explosive collars and disposal units that contain the detonations once they're removed. As they work everyone listens disdainfully to state-provided propaganda used to brainwash young children into believing in and following the behaviors that the state wants them to. The resistance is searching for an uplink to the satellite network that the media uses to broadcast the propaganda that will let them take control of the satellite network and broadcast the truth of the state.Mic recognizes Richards and is reluctant to remove his collar. Richards has been branded 'The Butcher of Bakersfield' after being framed for the food-riot massacre. Weiss argues that it's all network propaganda and that they owe him their lives though Laughlin argues back that Richards definitely isn't part of the resistance movement. Mic believes that Richards has seen too much of this movement but Richards silences them all by saying that all he's seen is talk and dreams which he knows isn't going to get anything done. He tells them that if they want to change things they need to 'put up or shut up.' Mic is impressed and consents to removing Richards' collar.The next morning Richards joins a truck ride ferrying barrio workers into the city proper. Richards' brother has agreed to help him get somewhere safe so he can try to start a new life in anonymity.We get a glimpse of the wealthier parts of Los Angeles as a limo arrives at the ICS television headquarters delivering Damon Killian (Richard Dawson) and his personal assistant Brenda (Karen Leigh Hopkins). Killian is the host of The Running Man and a much-beloved figure for the state. Killian's charming persona merely being a front for his actual crude holier-than-thou personality quickly shows through as he shakes the hand of a janitor whose mop he stumbles over telling him he's doing a good job but making note of his name and once in the elevator warning Brenda that she'll be mopping the floors all week if the janitor still has a job the next day. Arriving at his offices Killian consults with a 'talent agent' Tony (Kurt Fuller) for potential contestants for The Running Man.Walking through the upper-working class neighborhood of the city Richards arrives at his brother Edward's apartment. Knowing the security code to open the door he lets himself in and promptly notes something very wrong... the furniture isn't how he remembers it... and there are women's garments strewn about. It isn't long before the woman to whom these garments belong shows up... a working class woman named Amber Mendez (Maria Conchita Alonso). Mendez quickly sets about changing into exercise clothes and tuning into ICS channel 1 where a workout program is playing hosted by ten-time national champion Running Man stalker Captain Freedom (Jesse Ventura) now retired from stalking. As Mendez is doing sit-ups on her exercise bench the program is interrupted for a special news report on a door to door search being conducted by police for Richards reminding viewers that he's the infamous Butcher of Bakersfield who massacred innocent civilians eighteen months ago. Mendez starts resuming her sit-ups only to find Richards himself standing over her.Richards orders Mendez to tell him who she is and why she's in his brother's apartment. Mendez says she moved in last month knowing only that the last tenant was taken away by the state for 're-education...' Richards' face changes to show he knows that his brother has met with a very harsh fate. In the distraction Mendez tries to run away but she doesn't get far.Meanwhile at ICS Killian and Tony are looking through Justice Dept. profiles on convicted criminals and enemies of the state for potential contestants. Unfortunately Killian isn't satisfied with the latest potential prospects as they are physically unimposing and wouldn't last long enough to give the audience watching the show an entertaining experience. Then Killian sees a video feed of the prison break where Richards escaped from the Wilshire detention zone. Instantly his eyes light up with ratings points. Brenda reminds Killian that military prisoners are excluded from eligibility due to his department's contract but Killian is undaunted and has some influence with the right people... he places a call to the president's agent.Richards has tied Mendez down to her exercise bench and is taking some time to learn about her... Mendez writes music and sings theme songs for the ICS media network. Richards is amused to find that her closet has a box filled with music and clothing that's all on the censored list and only available on the black market; something Mendez says everyone does on the side. Mendez watches distastefully as Richards scans her travel pass into the Cadre Infonet to book a trip for both himself and her to Hawaii-- he plans to use her as a hostage and as a traveling companion who has the necessary clearance to travel. Of course Mendez doesn't see any reason why she should comply with Richards' plans... until he takes hold of the exercise bench which is bolted into the floor and using only one arm tears it loose from its moorings lifting the foot of the bench four feet into the air with her still tied to it. He gives her an unsettling smile and says that this is how he says 'please.'At the airport Richards uses a distraction and idle prattling and the line of travelers behind him to get past the front security checkpoint with Mendez despite the two of them having only one travel pass. He maintains control of Mendez with a hand around the back of her neck having warned her that he can easily break it. However as they walk through a crowded airport corridor Mendez sees a police/military soldier on a balcony above her and makes a move pounding a fist into Richards' groin and screaming for help yelling his name to everyone. Richards makes a break for it running out onto the airstrips as the airport security goes into full alert. A police cruiser and several motorcycles give pursuit and take him down with a device that launches a heavy weighted net.Richards is thrown into a holding cell where he finds himself face to face with Killian and his hulking burly bodyguard Sven (Sven-Ole Thorsen). Killian wastes no time going into his 'sales pitch' talking about how he created The Running Man but has a contract with the government who sends him felons to put on the show. Killian was fortunate to be able to pull a few strings to get Richards as a potential contestant after watching a video of the prison break. Killian wants Richards to volunteer as a contestant but quickly shows he's ready to blackmail him into it; Laughlin and Weiss have also been recaptured and Killian is ready to put them on the show in Richards' place if he refuses to volunteer. As Killian points out Laughlin and Weiss would be ""B-list"" contestants that would be fortunate to get far into the first zone in one piece.Richards is prepped for the show with several painful chemical injections that will allow show agents and stalkers to track him through the zones. He's then tossed into a holding cell that's quickly filled with knockout gas.The next morning Mendez is watching a TV broadcast of Richards' capture. She's stunned as the report shows the ticket agent and security guard they passed bloody and unconscious and the reporter says that Richards shot them at point-black range as he entered the airport. Both men are at Cadre Memorial Hospital in 'guarded condition.' Mendez of course knows Richards didn't shoot either of them and she's not at all pleased at the thought of who else could have.It's Friday night; time for the Running Man to go on the air. Large crowds assemble at the ICS game show stage various social gathering spots around the city and in the barrios all eager for a thrilling show. Beautiful costumed young women dance to opening music as the pre-show begins. A crowd outside cheers fanatically as one of the favored current stalkers 'Buzzsaw' Eddie Vatowski (Gus Reithwische) arrives in a limo and demonstrates his strength by pressing a special-made motorcycle he rides as a stalker over his head.Mendez is on duty at the ICS headquarters with a co-worker at a soft drink vending machine as Richards is escorted past; a court-appointed 'theatrical agent' reading a legal contract/waiver out loud. Richards and Mendez lock eyes as he is escorted past her; Mendez looking badly unnerved. She politely excuses herself telling her co-worker she has some paperwork to finish.Killian is introduced and comes out on stage easily milking the crowd for fanatical cheers and applause. As he opens the show Mendez is seen entering a room and showing her employee pass to a guard. Killian has the main show announcer Phil Hilton announce tonight's guest runner. A monitor plays a carefully doctored video recording from the helicopter Richards was piloting at the time of the Bakersfield massacre making it look like the dispatch ordered a mission abort but Richards overpowered the guards and used the helicopter's machine guns and rocket launchers to slaughter over sixty civilians including women and children. People watching the show all around the city bow their heads in numb silence as the doctored video is re-played and Killian gives a well-crafted closing to the video aimed at stirring the audience and all viewers into a frenzy and desire to see Richards butchered. Everyone responds appropriately as Richards is brought onto the stage.Mendez walks through a control room for the show and quietly slips into an information retrieval room as Killian continues with show dialogue; that Richards appearing on the show as a volunteer entitles him to various perks if he should win. Three running men from the previous season named Whitman Price and Haddad are shown in Hawaii with beautiful women; as winners from the last season they've received full pardons and are now living a good life. Making sure the blinds are closed completely Mendez starts looking through media folders in a cabinet.Richards is placed into a sled-like vehicle on the stage that will be launched into a tube-tunnel that will ferry him from the main game show stage into the start of the first actual game zone. No sooner do the heavy manacles close locking him into the sled when Killian announces a special surprise: Richards' cohorts from the prison break Laughlin and Weiss will be sent into the zone as contestants along with him. Richards stares in outrage as two other launch tubes open to reveal Weiss and Laughlin similarly fettered into launch sleds.As Killian continues his monologue going over more game rules (runners have three hours to cross through all four game zone quadrants while the stalkers hunt them down) and working the crowd into a near-rabid state Mendez continues looking through various media information folders. The sleds are launched through the tubes into the first game zone quadrant. Meanwhile back in the private media information room Mendez makes a curious find: two folders for the Bakersfield massacre. One media card is edited for television and the other is raw footage. She secretes the raw footage card into her clothing and puts back the other one closing up the cabinet... and a hand comes down onto her shoulder spinning her around.Richards Laughlin and Weiss arrive at the start of the first quadrant; their sleds halted by special tension barriers as ground crew get them out of the sleds so they can start running. Killian pulls a randomly selected audience member to choose the first stalker to send in after them. As she's given ten seconds to think it over a small barker crew in the barrio ruins is working a betting board taking wagers on who will go in and how fast they'll make the kill. The audience member chooses 'Professor' Subzero (Professor Toru Tanaka) a heavily built but squat man in a high-tech hockey outfit complete with helmet and ice skates and a hockey stick made out of heavy metal that can chop through solid steel.The ground crew both on foot and motorcycles herds the contestants through the start of the game zone as various other show staff are seen in a backstage room including Captain Freedom who does guest commentary on the show from time to time.Richards Laughlin and Weiss are herded into the first part of the first quadrant; a huge indoor area where the air is very cold. A gate drops down behind them and lights come on cameras coming to life as Subzero moves in for the kill. His skates giving him more control on the floor of the chamber than the running men Subzero bashes them about and then pushes Weiss across the chamber like a human hockey puck... right into a 'hockey goal' that quickly snaps closed like a Venus flytrap around him. The audience and viewers around the city eat it all up. The audience member who chose Subzero as the killing stalker is given a number of prizes including a 'Running Man' home board game.Richards and Laughlin try to get to Weiss and free him only to find Subzero ready. Knocked against a chain-link fence Richards tears loose a piece of pipe to which a coiled length of razor-ribbon wire is attached. He pulls it along with him as Subzero pursues him. Suddenly Richards dives off to one side pulling the razor ribbon taut across the narrow corridor... and Subzero's charge carries him right into it; the razor ribbon wrapping around his neck. Richards yanks on the piece of pipe mooring digging the razor ribbon deeper into Subzero's unprotected neck. Viewers all around the city watch aghast and numb with shock as Subzero falls. Richards and Laughlin mock Killian over their victory before freeing Weiss and moving on. Killian appears at a loss for words as he says a great champion has fallen... and then quickly cuts to 'important sponsor messages.'Back in his office however on the phone with an agent from the Justice Department Killian is rather dismissive of Subzero's death saying a stalker being killed by running men was inevitable and part of the violent element of the show that keeps people in front of TV sets instead of picket lines.Back on stage Killian is getting the crowd incited again and has picked a new audience member to select the next stalker. He's torn between two of them and can't decide... so Killian offers a big surprise; to send in both stalkers together as a tag-team. Buzzsaw who was the previous year's champion with the most kills racked up wields an oversized Durasteel chainsaw that can cut through almost any man-made compound. Dynamo (Erland van Lidth) is likewise big and burly clad in a metallic suit covered with multicolored lights with electrical generators that let him discharge electric surge... and he has a penchant for singing opera.As the stalkers are introduced Killian takes a brief backstage break where Brenda tells him that ratings are up eight points... and she has more news: ICS security caught Richards' airport hostage pulling classified Bakersfield video files.Killian comes back on stage to announce another surprise for the audience a special guest running man-- or running woman. Mendez is dragged on to the stage to be thrown into the game. Phil Hilton the game show announcer has wasted little time fabricating a whole propaganda story of Mendez as a school cheater and a lifetime lawbreaker culminating with having been a secret lover of Richards. Mendez is instantly disgusted at the lies spouted about her but she has little time to berate Killian about it before she's fettered into another sled and launched through the tube and hustled through the start of the first zone.Richards Laughlin and Weiss are crossing into the next quadrant when Weiss notices a camera relay that strikes him as odd; because it's pointing into the zone instead of straight up. Hurrying to investigate he sees a number of camera relay dishes all pointing toward the middle of the game zone. This means that the uplink center to the satellite network is there... a perfect spot to hide it a place where nobody ever goes. Richards is immediately at odds with Laughlin and Weiss; he wants to focus on surviving the game while Laughlin and Weiss now have a new mission; to find the uplink center crack the code and give Mic and his people the means to jam the state TV network and broadcast their own transmissions.As Buzzsaw and Dynamo are given a relay by the trackers on the runners' position Richards Laughlin and Weiss are trying to hide from a sweeping light underneath one of the cameras. As they're hiding against a ruined piece of wall Mendez catches up with them... just in time for Buzzsaw and Dynamo to reach the scene.All four contestants scramble for cover. Richards hefts a big thick piece of timber as a weapon but Buzzsaw's chainsaw cuts it clean in half like a toothpick. Weiss and Mendez get separated from Richards and Laughlin; Dynamo pursuing the first two while Buzzsaw goes after the latter two. Weiss and Mendez manage to hide from Dynamo and stumble across the uplink center for the satellite relay. Insisting to Mendez that the resistance movement has spent five years trying to find it and that it's more important than any of their lives Weiss hurries toward it.Laughlin and Richards run through the ruins and suddenly find themselves in the cross-shine of several light relays. Buzzsaw comes screaming out of an alley on his motorcycle wielding his massive chainsaw easily in one hand. Laughlin shoves Richards aside-- and the chainsaw slices across Laughlin's upper chest mangling the flesh and bone. Richards ducks and tumbles to the side as Buzzsaw makes a second ride-by attack and again hurries to tend to Laughlin. Turning again Buzzsaw turns his chainsaw off and hangs it from the front of his cycle pulling out a weighted bola attached to a long metal cable. He snags Richards in it and drags him behind the motorcycle across the ground. Viewers all around the city cheer wildly eating it up. Killian gives the audience member who selected the stalkers a selection of take-home prizes again including a 'home edition' Running Man board game.Buzzsaw finally drags Richards past a ruined section of wall where Richards is able to wrap the cable around a piece of metal jutting from it. Audience members and fans all groan as Buzzsaw's motorcycle is halted pitching him a number of yards forward rolling across the ground.Meanwhile Weiss is leading Mendez through the uplink center and finds the interface. To his dismay however the interface is encrypted with a hexagonal decode system an extremely tough form of coding to crack; certainly not something they can afford to waste any time over with Dynamo still on their trail. Mendez paces and frets as Weiss works feverishly to decode the uplink code system pleading with Mendez to ensure that the code gets to Mic and the resistance if Weiss doesn't make it through himself.Richards slowly walks toward Buzzsaw. He reaches for the chainsaw when suddenly the burly stalker awakens grabbing Richards around the neck. He yanks Richards down the ground and seizes his weapon; the chainsaw roaring to life as Buzzsaw tries to rip Richards apart. The two battle hand to hand as Richards struggles to keep the buzzing blade away from him. When Buzzsaw taunts Richards the ex-cop reaches down deep for extra strength and pushes Buzzsaw's arms down forcing him to twist the chainsaw further downward. By the time Buzzsaw notices that the blade has been pushed down between his own legs Richards then yanks his arms upward... and the blade rips into Buzzsaw's groin. The stalker falsetto-screams in wild agony as his own weapon mangles the weakest part of his own body and he crumples to the ground in a bloody heap. Fans all around the city again groan in profound sadness and grief.At the uplink center Weiss finally completes the decode making Mendez say the alpha-numeric code sequence out loud and memorize it. But time may be out for the two... Dynamo has found them. Raising his arms Dynamo looses a surge of electric charge blasting into the two of them. Mendez is hurt but alive... but Weiss still touching the metallic housing of the uplink interface takes the full blast of the discharge and is killed.Richards hears Mendez scream and rushes to find her. Dynamo has dragged her out of the complex into the open and plans to indulge in a little fun before killing her. Richards runs toward them yelling to distract Dynamo. The stalker sends a mild electric charge into Mendez's body to subdue her before sending a larger lethal blast at Richards. Richards ducks out of the way and Dynamo climbs back into his race-car-like vehicle to pursue Richards. The fans cheer wildly again as Dynamo singing more opera races after Richards. But Dynamo gets too reckless and caught up in the moment of the kill trying to drive his vehicle up the same mound of debris that Richards has started to climb. Dynamo's vehicle overturns tumbling back down the mound. Fans again react in shock and numb horror as they see that Dynamo is now trapped and helpless without power to his surge generators as Richards advances toward him with a huge piece of metal pipe.Even more stunning however is when Richards slowly tells Dynamo that he refuses to kill a helpless human; even a bloodthirsty ruthless killer like Dynamo. The amount of boos and jeers from the equally bloodthirsty fans is shocking.Richards drops the pipe and walks off with Mendez who sadly tells him that Weiss is dead; but she has the uplink code for the satellite relay. They find their way back to Laughlin who is on the verge of death. With his dying words Laughlin pleads with Richards not to let his and Weiss' deaths be in vain; to carry out their mission and get the uplink codes to Mic who has a broadcast center in the fourth quadrant of the game zone. Knowing that Laughlin died for him Richards is filled with the resolve to avenge him.Back in the locker room a woman's voice comes over speakers summoning 'Fireball' to wardrobe. A tall burly man among the viewers (Jim Brown) slowly nods and rises to his feet as Killian still on stage calls for the halftime show.A monitor near Richards and Mendez lights up with a video transmission from Killian who's in his office only with Sven Brenda Tony and a couple of camera personnel. Killian is delighted with Richards' performance and the super-high ratings for the show. Richards listens in disbelief as Killian offers him a three-year contract deal to become a stalker on The Running Man complete with a lot of trappings wholly unavailable to most people. Ripping a camera off its moorings and glaring into it Richards vows that he's going to survive and win and come back for Killian himself... and kill him in brutal fashion.Just as Richards hurls the camera to the ground smashing it the phone rings in Killian's office. Brenda tells him the attorney general is calling.Fireball comes onto the stage to roaring cheers and applause. He wears a flame-retardant suit and goggles a rocket pack on his back and wields a high-powered flamethrower. As the fans cheer Captain Freedom back in the backstage lockers takes some pills with a drink and looks nostalgically at a poster of himself from his days as a champion stalker.As Fireball heads out into the zone Killian calls another audience member up and asks her to predict who will make the next kill: Fireball or Dynamo who's not out of it yet. The elderly woman thinks hard and suddenly announces that she feels that Ben Richards will make the next kill. The audience and fans around the city are surprised but the old woman stubbornly defends her choice.In the barrios several men suddenly shout that they want to place bets on Richards. As the idea catches on among the barrio viewers the men running the betting shrug and agree writing his name on the odds boards and taking bets on Richards.And the time for the next bout of action is at hand as Fireball arrives at the third quadrant where Richards and Mendez have reached. Fireball lands and runs after the two on foot pursuing them into an underground center and cutting them off forcing them to duck for cover as he looses a blast from his flamethrower.Shoving Mendez to one side and telling her to run Richards hefts several large barrels and hurls them one by one at Fireball who catches them on his arms and shoulders deflecting them to the sides. Richards kicks another barrel over causing the oil within to spill and then ignite from Fireball's flamethrower. The stalker easily walks through the flames protected by his suit. Noticing a box of flares at his feet Richards grabs one and hurries to meet back up with Mendez who's found her way into the ruins of a locker room safe from the ICS network cameras. Her leg brushes against something and she screams in terror as she sees a decaying corpse at her feet. Fireballs hears her scream and zeroes in.Regaining her composure Mendez notes that there are three corpses; each one with an identifying dog tag around their neck. She goes to examine the dog tags... and notes that two of them bear the names Whitman and Price. As she goes to the third one Fireball comes there telling her that the third one is Haddad. The winners of the last season was another state lie. Slowly Fireball turns his flamethower's nozzle toward her ready to make the kill.Suddenly Richards is behind Fireball yanking the gas line out of his rocket pack and kicking him into the lockers. As Fireball struggles to regain his bearings Richards scoops up Mendez and ignites the flare tossing it at Fireball's feet. The gas leak in Fireball's rocket pack explodes violently the inferno reaching out where the ICS cameras pick it up and blasting Fireball's charred corpse into full view. The fans are in dismay again seeing that Richards has taken another stalker down. The barrio bettors however are pleased having won big money on Richards.In the ICS backstage lockers Captain Freedom is summoned to wardrobe.Killian and Brenda are looking at monitor relays grimly when Captain Freedom bursts in outfitted in a high tech suit; the chestpiece laden with a number of weapons. Freedom is outraged at the suit he's been made to put on refusing to go out and stalk while weighted down in it. Although he misses his days as a champion stalker he refuses to play by modern rules. Ten years ago at the height of his stalking days he went out and killed runners with his bare hands adhering to a strict gladiatorial code of honor. Killian is equally outraged at Captain Freedom's continued belief in this system reminding him that people are betting on Richards winning the game which would create a lot of unrest among people yearning for more personal liberties. Finally losing his patience Killian yells at Sven to escort Captain Freedom out even insulting the bodyguard by asking him if steroids are making him deaf. Sven finally turns and gives Captain Freedom a shrug and the now-ex announcer storms out.Richards and Mendez have made it to the fourth quadrant and are looking for Mic's secret broadcast center. It's Mic who finds them first after they blithely walk right into one of his own traps. Mic could afford to take no chances about the location of the resistance hideout and broadcast center being discovered which is why he couldn't send any help to Richards. But now safe from ICS cameras he's come for them and brings them to the relative safety of his broadcast center.Meanwhile needing to bring the show (and any budding hopes among the populace) to a successful close Richards is having Tony work his digital CGI magic taking snippets of various media logs to synthesize a staged battle between Richards and Captain Freedom.In the secret resistance broadcast center excitement runs high as Mendez announces that she has the satellite uplink code meaning Weiss and Laughlin's deaths won't be in vain. Just then TV sets in the center buzz with renewed action from the game show. Killian has taken the stage and is telling fans that the runners have entered the final quad and Captain Freedom has come out of retirement to finish them. The synthesized mock-up CGI battle scene is played for the unsuspecting fans showing Richards and Mendez falling into the final game zone through a chute. Captain Freedom grabs Mendez by the scruff of her neck lifts her up and fatally breaks her neck and hurls her into a coil of razor ribbon killing her. Richards engages Captain Freedom in a brutal hand-to-hand fight before Freedom charges ahead taking Richards off balance and forcing him back-first into a heavily spiked gate. The fans all go bonkers as Phil Hilton announces that Captain Freedom has succeeded in finishing off the last two runners upholding his name and reputation as all-time champion stalker.Richards and Mendez are only mildly amused at the synthesized battle. It does give them the convenience of everyone thinking they're dead which buys them time to help Mic plan an uprising. Once Mic steals the network signal ICS will attempt to shunt the next one in orbit. He needs to send Stevie in with a team to the ICS building to stop them. Richards seeing them as untrained kids offers to help lead them so he can fulfill his vow to Killian that he'd be back for retaliation.Mic says he'll be sending the uplink code in twenty minutes and ten seconds later he'll be on the air. Mendez tells him to can any planned speech; she has something better... the raw unedited footage of the Bakersfield massacre. She hefts an automatic machine pistol and smiles smugly preparing to help storm the ICS building with Richards and Stevie.The raid team storms in through the basement as Running Man dancers are doing their part in wrapping up the post-game show. Killian takes the stage handling the post-game with his usual charm. But Killian is in for a rude surprise as Mic successfully hijacks the network signals with the uplink code and plays unedited footage for people watching the post-game all around the city: first revealing the true fates of the previous season winners Whitman Price and Haddad... and then playing the unedited footage of the Bakersfield massacre showing that the state carried it out and then left Richards as the scapegoat. Everyone watches in absolute dizzied shock as the unedited footage is being played out. Brenda and Tony in the control room realize the signal is coming from the network satellite but Stevie and his team come barging in with guns pointed to stop any attempts to override.On stage Killian frantically tries to calm the fans when Richards comes busting in with his half of the resistance team. People watching the end of the show in bars and social centers around the city find out the full truth of things as ICS/army soldiers open fire at Richards-- and indiscriminately kill anything moving including innocent civilian audience members trying to flee in terror while Richards and his team do everything in their power to herd the audience to safety and keep them out of the line of fire.Meanwhile in a backstage corridor Mendez is keeping guard when she suddenly finds Dynamo standing behind her. Knocking Mendez down Dynamo plans to rape her before killing her since he failed to do it earlier in the game zone. Seeing Mendez reach for her gun he grabs her wrist wrestling for control of the gun. The weapon goes off and activates the overhead sprinklers which short out the electrical controls in Dynamo's light suit electrocuting him.Richards and his team finish taking out the police soldiers but Killian seems unafraid and smug as Richards approaches him; Sven is on the scene. But Sven merely throws Killian's remark about Sven being a steroid junkie back in his face before giving Richards a polite nod and half-smile and walking off stage leaving Killian at the mercy of a very angry Richards.Forgetting that the cameras are still rolling Killian tries to reason with Richards giving a smooth pitch about how American people grow up on a diet of television and TV violence and for 50 years media and marketing experts have exploited this to go further than giving them wrestling and game shows using commercial advertisements to tell people what to eat how to dress practically how to live. Richards pays no attention as he activates the sled controls at the launch tube. Grabbing Killian Richards admits he hasn't been in show business long but he's learned very quickly and he thinks that right now people would like a little something else.Richards slams Killian down onto the sled's chair and the manacles snap shut fettering him in place. Richards launches the sled through the tubes. Killian hurtles through the tube system out into the beginning of the first game zone. With the ground crew and barriers gone the sled continues hurtling through the air until it crashes into an advertisement poster for Cadre cola and explodes killing the entertainment kingpin. Fans all around the city and barrio having seen the truth about ICS and Killian burst into wild cheers and applause.Mendez makes her way up onto the stage. She smiles at Richards as he approaches her and they start kissing. A large monitor on the outskirts of the city goes dark and reads 'Please stand by.' Fade to black as the credits begin to roll."

"In the year 2017 the world economy has collapsed. The great freedoms of the United States are no longer as the once great nation has sealed off its borders and become a militarized police state censoring all film art literature and communications. Even so a small resistance force led by two revolutionaries manages to fight the oppression. With full control over the media the government attempts to quell the nation's yearning for freedom by broadcasting a number of game shows on which convicted criminals fight for their lives. The most popular and sadistic of these programs is ""The Running Man"" hosted by Damon Killian. When a peaceful protest of starving citizens gathers in Bakersfield California a police officer named Ben Richards is ordered to fire on the crowd which he refuses to do. Subdued by the other officers the attack is carried out and Richards is framed for the murder of almost a hundred unarmed civilians. Following a daring jail break months later Richards is captured once again and forced to appear on ""The Running Man"" with three other convicts. With their help he fights his way through a cadre of sadistic gladiators hunting them down through the ruins of a Los Angeles earthquake but not promising Killian that he'll return to settle the score when the show's host double-crosses him. In the meantime the contestants must search through the ruins for the resistance in the hopes of finally broadcasting the truth about the government.::Curly Q. Link"

"Randall ""Memphis"" Raines a notorious Los Angeles car thief has left his life of crime behind him and gone straight teaching Go-Kart Racing for kids in Central California. His younger brother Kip Raines has nevertheless followed in his footsteps and is in the midst of stealing 50 high-end cars for a British gangster Raymond Calitri. One night after stealing a Porsche Kip spies a beautiful woman in the passenger seat of another car and to impress her challenges her date to a race. This chase attracts the attention of the police who follow Kip to the warehouse where the stolen cars are being stored. Kip and his gang flee from the police in time but the boost is ruined the cars are impounded and Calitri is infuriated.Calitri kidnaps Kip. Atley Jackson Memphis' long-time friend takes him to see Calitri who threatens to kill Kip and Memphis if they don't steal the required 50 cars in three days when they are due on a ship headed to South America. With no choice but to steal the cars Memphis gathers a rag-tag crew of car thieves including Atley autobody shop owner Otto Halliwell DMV employee Donny Astricky a mute mortician known as The Sphinx and Memphis' ex-girlfriend mechanic/bartender Sara ""Sway"" Wayland. Kip insists on helping with his young crew members Tumbler Mirror Man Freb and Toby. They use Otto's shop as headquarters for the heist and Toby hacks the DMV database to locate the cars on the list which are all given female nicknames. The last car on the list dubbed Eleanor is a customized 1967 Mustang GT that has repeatedly brought trouble for Memphis.LAPD Detectives Castlebeck and Drycoff of the Governor's Regional Auto Theft Bureau investigate the case. At the abandoned warehouse Castlebeck notices mysterious shattered glass. They hear Memphis is back in town and pay him a visit but he claims he is merely visiting for a family emergency and will soon be leaving. The detectives remain suspicious. The three Mercedes impounded by the police all require laser-cut keys which are impossible to clone. Drycoff discovers that all were purchased from a Newport dealer Dressner Foreign Motors which has only one ex-con working there who happens to handle replacing lost keys from the manufacturer in Germany. They confront him and threaten to arrest him for grand theft auto unless he cooperates. He agrees to contact them if the person who paid him for the replacement keys returns which he does as they predict.The police set up surveillance on the three Mercedes. While parked in a minivan four doors down Castlebeck and Drycoff spot the Raines brothers who just take photos of the Mercedes in the driveway. The Raines brothers are accosted by some gang members who accused Memphis of stealing the job from Calitri. The brothers take shelter in a diner where members of the California Highway Patrol are eating. Memphis distracts a truck driver while Kip chains his truck to the gang members' chassis. When he drives away he pulls their car apart and they pull their weapons. The CHiPS run out and arrest the gang members for illegal guns.Freb eager to prove himself steals a 1983 Cadillac Eldorado when he spots it in a bad neighborhood with the keys left inside. Unfortunately it turns out to be a car used by drug dealers and contains heroin in the trunk. Before they can get rid of the car Castlebeck arrives at Otto's shop. He remarks that the other cars in the shop are classics and questions why anybody would invest money to restore an '83 Eldorado. While calling to check if the car had been reported stolen Castlebeck notices that the call signs of the police units working that night are written down indicating when their second heist is happening. Memphis is worried realizing the police are breathing down their necks.The heist begins smoothly and one by one the cars are stolen and driven to the Long Beach Naval Shipyard where they are immediately hidden in containers to be loaded onto the cargo ship. Castlebeck and Drycoff continue their surveillance on the three Mercedes and return to the parked minivan in the neighborhood four houses down from the Mercedes. But they are forced to improvise when another minivan parks in the driveway next to them blocking their view of the Mercedes and they park their car closer. When Memphis arrives he stops just before he opens the car door when he realizes the minivan from the photos is now two doors down not four.Memphis calls Astricky about to steal another Mercedes from outside the casino and tells him the Mercedes are under surveillance. The whole deal will be off if they do not have every single car on the list. As they still have the replacement keys from the Mercedes impounded by the police they decide to steal the cars from the police impound lot. Mirror Man causes a distraction and they successfully steal the three Mercedes.Detectives Castlebeck and Drycoff are told by a coworker from the Homicide Unit to back off Calitri as he is under investigation for murder. A despondent Castlebeck receives a report from the lab about the shattered glass identifying it as a black light. He and Drycoff go to the abandoned warehouse with functional black lights and discover the original list of cars. Knowing Memphis' past with Eleanor Castlebeck realizes that the 1967 Mustang will be last on the list and their best chance for catching him in the act.Defying Memphis' orders not to deviate from the exact plan Toby follows Kip and Tumbler to a suburban home where they plan to steal a Cadillac Escalade. Toby wanders outside the garage and is spotted by a young woman who raises the alarm that the car is being stolen. A private security guard pursues them and fires at the SUV wounding Toby. Atley takes Toby to a shady doctor he knows who saves his life no questions asked.Castlebeck and Drycoff arrive just as Memphis is boosting Eleanor and begin a long pursuit through Long Beach. He manages to evade the police and arrives with a very beat up Eleanor shortly after the deadline of 8 p.m. Calitri refuses to take the car and instead orders his henchmen to kill Memphis whose life is saved at the last minute by Kip and Atley.Memphis goes after Calitri and pursues him in a large warehouse at the Navy Yard where Castlebeck and Drycoff join the pursuit guns drawn. When Calitri corners Castlebeck and is about to kill him Memphis arrives and saves Castlebeck's life by kicking Calitri who falls over the railing several stories to his death. In gratitude Castlebeck allows Memphis to leave but first Memphis tells him where he can find the 49 boosted cars in the yard.Later the gang gathers to celebrate with a barbecue at Otto's shop where Kip presents Memphis with an old rusted out ""Eleanor"" awaiting to be refurbished."

"Saturday October 8 120 miles northeast of Blainsworth Nebraska; 1:16 p.m.Bob Irisin a metrologist for the Kansas City weather bureau is riding in his Bronco truck when he stops and radios to his friend Stan in Kansas City that he is witnessing a sudden change in weather patterns in the area. Then a tornado suddenly touches down near a farm where Bob sees a family of a man woman and their little girl standing in front of the house unaware of the tornado approaching behind them. Bob drives as near as he can go and manages to yell out a warning to the family seconds before they see the twister coming. The family runs into their storm shelter just in time before the twister destroys their house. Bob drives away from harms way just in time.Meanwhile in Blainsworth there is the annual fall Bike-a-thon race for the high school kids. 13-year-old Dan Hatch gets a flat tire and doesnt come in at all.

Dan walks his bike into the town square where his best friend Arthur talks with him about getting ""crashed and burned"" during the race. Jack walks over and becomes hard on Dan for not finishing the race like a man should. Dan yells at his father for being so demanding and that he can't expect anything from anyone.

Jack then arrives and tells Dan and Arthur to bring their bicycles in for its raining. Going out they find that its raining hard and the winds are picking up speed.

Bob overhears a farmer named Gus talk about the storm and of tornados reported in the area. Bob tells Gus that most people killed by tornados are driving in their cars and the best place to be is at home next to the nearest storm cellar. After Bob leaves Laura gets relieved from her job and calls Jack to pick her up.At the Hatch house Jack Dan and Arthur see a TV broadcast of a tornado warning in the area. While Dan and Arthur unplug all electrical appliances in the house Jack tries phoning his mother. But the senile Goldie has passed out and doesn't hear the phone ringing.

Alone in the house Dan and Arthur watch the TV in which the picture gets increasingly static.At the diner Laura calls Dan again to ask if Jack is coming to pick her up. Then the phone goes dead. Jenny arrives at the diner to drive Laura home when fierce winds hit the diner. Jenny's car stalls and she and Laura must take shelter in the diner. As they run back to the building a flying trash can lid carried by the strong wind smacks Laura in the face gashing her right cheek wide open.At the Hatch house Dan and Arthur talk about the storm when they hear a tornado siren. Then they hear a whirring sound approaching. Dan goes upstairs to check on baby Ryan while Arthur panics wanting to get out of the house. Dan sends him down into the basement while he goes back upstairs to get Ryan. When Dan arrives again in Ryan's room he finds the baby not in its crib. Dan goes to the window and is almost sucked out by the vacuum when he sees the menacing sight of a tornado approaching the house. Dan manages to get Ryan and Arthur down into the basement when the tornado hits the house sending debris everywhere.At the diner Laura and Jenny huddle in the corner of the damaged building and hear a report on the radio that a twister has touched down where Dan and Arthur are.Dan carrying baby Ryan and Arthur emerge from the wreckage which was once the Hatch house and begin looking among the wreckage of next door houses. Then the boys run into Stacey and Rhonnie Vae. Looking around they find a neighbor lying on the ground dead. Dan and the group gets into the man's car and drive off toward Blainsworth to find the rest of the Hatch family.In Blainsworth Laura and Jenny arrive on a bus at a rescue station which is already jammed with badly wounded people from the town. Bob Irisin is also there talking to a reporter who tells him of the rouge weather patterns and that the tornado menace may not be over.On a road outside the town Dan Arthur Stacey and Ronnie Vae come to a roadblock where the police officer there tells them to get out of the car so they can be taken into town. Arthur and Ronnie Vae get out with baby Ryan but Dan determined to find his father drives through the barricade with Stacey to Grandma Goldie's farm.Arriving at the farm Dan and Stacey find Grandma Goldie in some wreckage of her barn. Taking her back to the car they set off when they find Jack's overturned Bronco truck with Jack pinned underneath. Unable to move the truck Dan and Stacey drive back to the roadblock and ask the policeman for help. While Stacey rides into town in a police car the officer reluctantly takes Dan with him and other officers to get Jack out from under the Bronco. The officer then takes Dan and Jack to the diner where Laura works. Finding it destroyed Dan wonders if his mother is all right.At the rescue station Laura is comforted by Jenny who tells her that Dan and Jack may be okey and are looking for them. Then another tornado suddenly touches down nearby and all the people take shelter wherever it is.At another rescue station Dan Jack and the officer arrive where Arthur Stacey and Ronnie Vae are waiting for them. While Arthur and Ronnie Vae fall asleep Dan and Stacey talk nearby about the night and of the fear of the tornados. They start getting to like one another. Jack tries to get in touch with other rescue stations but since all the phone lines are down its difficult.At the other rescue station Grandma Goldie arrives and Laura asks her if Dan and the others are all right. Goldie is in a state of shock and speaks gibberish due to a head wound on her forehead. Nearby Bob is talking with Jenny about his job as a metrologist and they start getting close. Laura approaches them and asks Bob to take her and Jenny back to the house to see if Dan and Jack are there. Bob agrees and after the all clear signal is heard the three of them get into Bob's truck and set off.At the rescue station where Dan is he overhears Jack about driving around to find if Laura is all right. Dan takes baby Ryan and they get into a rescue truck that Jack takes to find Laura. Jack is understandably not pleased when he sees Dan and Ryan in the back seat and wants to take them back. Dan refuses saying that they should stick together because they are family. Jack very reluctantly agrees.At the destroyed Hatch home Bob Laura and Jenny arrive and stare at the destroyed house wondering where everyone else is.At the other rescue station Jack arrives and finds out that Laura and Jenny were there and set out to find them. Jack and Dan arrive back at their destroyed house and are reunited with Laura and everyone.Suddenly multiple tornados touch down nearby and Bob says that since there is no place to take shelter around that they should make a run for it. Bob and Jenny get into his truck and Laura Jack Dan and Ryan get into theirs and drive off. On the main road outside Blainsworth the group watches multi-funneled tornados all round them in the flat countryside. Laura looks behind them and witness to her horror a tornado touching down on the road behind them and swallowing up a car with two people still inside. Trying to outrun the twister they drive into town when a flying branch smashes the windshield knocking Jack out. Dan grabs the steering wheel and drives around the large debris on the road in the town with the tornado right behind them. The tornado chases them to an freeway underpass where they stop with several emergency vehicles. The tornado stops directly above the underpass and Dan is almost sucked out of the car window by the suction. Then the twister disappears. Bob Jenny and a few other paramedics emerge from under their vehicles and help the Hatchs out of their truck. Shaken but grateful to be alive the Jack Dan and Laura walk down the road as dawn begins to break.In a voice-over narration by Dan set one year later: the so-called 'Night of the Twisters' left five people dead 15 seriously wounded over 1200 homeless and left $2 million worth of damage in Blainesworth.Jack closed his hardware store but found a new course for his life in teaching football at the local high school.Laura found a new job and still has time for the family.Arthur got to be class president and is still a bumbling geek.Dan got closer to Stacey and they began dating frequently and going to important school functions including the junior prom.Baby Ryan got older and bigger and is still active.Bob and Jenny got married and settled down in Blainsworth.

In the year 1971 the Indo-Pakistani had a Valiant war. At the end of this war 92000 Pakistani soldiers returned home and 60000 Indian Defense Personnel also returned. But 54 Indian soldiers remain unaccounted for. Pakistan denies their presence in any Pakistani jail. Thirty-three years later their families are still waiting for their return. Yet there is proof that the POWs continue to languish in Pakistan jails -- the verbal testimony of someone as eminent as the late Zulfikar Bhutto photographs in Time Magazine as well as testimonies of other people who had been imprisoned in Pakistan jails. But it makes no difference. These men are technically neither dead nor alive.::gavin (gunmasterM@hotmail.com)

When her sister is kidnapped by white slavers only Grandpa knows what to do. He puts in a call to a fictional hero Jake Speed. She is amazed to find that he actually exists and that as flesh and blood is much less formidable than his reputation.::John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net>
While vacationing in Paris with some friends young carefree student Maureen Winston is abducted in broad daylight by a gang of white slavers. Her family is desperate especially her guilt-ridden older sister Margaret who was the one who talked Maureen into taking a trip to see Europe. Despite some comforting words the State Department has no idea where the girl is which leaves her desperate family out of options. However Grandpa Winston suggests that they should turn to pulp heroes like Remo Williams (a.k.a. The Destroyer) Mack Bolan (a.k.a. The Executioner) or Jake Speed (a character made-up for the movie) for help. Everyone believes it's just dementia talking until Margaret's best friend Wendy visits her the next day and finds a message addressed to Margaret under the door. The note only says that if Margaret wants to see her sister again she should go to a sleazy bar near the peer. Driven by guilt she does so and meets Jake Speed's assistant Desmond Floyd there. He explains that Jake is willing to take her case for free. Jake then finally shows up but he seems like he's not all there. He explains to Margaret that her sister is being held by Sid a sadistic murderous British white slaver and crime lord who operates from a (fictional) African country where a full blown armed rebellion is in progress. He also explains that all pulp fiction heroes are actually real (including Doc Savage) and that their novels are all based on their wild real-life adventures. Margaret buys this and agrees to travel there with Jake and Desmond. However once there she's attacked almost blown up and almost sold into slavery by Jake all as part of his plan which he neglected to explain to her. She eventually begins to suspect that there's something wrong with Jake and his friend and runs away. She finds her way to a consulate that's being evacuated due to heavy fighting. The consul explains that Jake and his friend are two infamous benign fraudsters who actually believe that they are two pulp fiction heroes. However when he asks Margaret to lead him to the barn where the two are religiously waiting for her return it becomes perfectly clear that Jake although not exactly at his best is very much who he says he is but the consul is not. Jake and Margaret are captured and taken at gunpoint to Jake's archnemesis Sid's villa where Margaret's sister is being held as well. Can the good guys win even in the 1980s?

"Opening sceneIt is late in the 22nd Century. United Planet cruiser C57D is a year out from Earth base on the way to Altair for a special mission. Commander J.J Adams (Leslie Neilsen) orders the crew to the deceleration booths as the ship drops from light speed to normal space.Adams orders pilot Jerry Farman (Jack Kelly) to lay in a course for the fourth planet. The captain then briefs the crew that they are at their destination and that they are to look for survivors from the Bellerophon expedition 20 years earlier.As they orbit the planet looking for signs of life the ship is scanned by a radar facility some 20 square miles in area. Morbius (Walter Pigeon) contacts the ship from the planet asking why the ship is here. Morbius goes on to explain he requires nothing no rescue is required and he can't guarantee the safety of the ship or its crew.Adams confirms that Morbius was a member of the original crew but is puzzled at the cryptic warning Morbius realizes the ship is going to land regardless and gives the pilot coordinates in a desert region of the planet. The ship lands and security details deploy. Within minutes a high speed dust cloud approaches the ship. Adams realizes it is a vehicle and as it arrives the driver is discovered to be a robot (Robby). Robby welcomes the crew to Altair 4 and invites members of the crew to Morbius' residence.Adams Farman and Doc Ostrow (Warren Stevens) arrive at the residence and are greeted by Morbius. They sit down to a meal prepared by Robby's food synthesizer and Morbius shows the visitors Robby's other abilities including his unwavering obedience. Morbius then gives Robby a blaster with orders to shoot Adams. Robby refuses and goes into a mechanical mind lock disabling him until the order is changed.Morbius then shows the men the defense system of the house (A series of steel shutters). When questioned Morbius admits that the Belleraphon crew is dead Morbius and his wife being the only original survivors. Morbius's wife has also died but months after the others and from natural causes. Morbius goes on to explain many of the crew were torn limb from limb by a strange creature or force living on the planet. The Belleraphon herself was destroyed when the final three surviving members tried to take off for Earth.Adams wonders why this force has remained dormant all these years and never attacked Morbius. As discussions continue a young woman Altaira (Anne Francis) introduces herself as Morbius daughter. Farman takes an immediate interest in Altaira and begins to flirt with her
.
Altaira then shows the men her ability to control wild animals by petting a wild tiger. During this display the ship checks in on the safety of the away party. Adams explains he will need to check in with Earth for further orders and begins preparations for sending a signal. Because of the power needed the ship will be disabled for up to 10 days. Morbius is mortified by this extended period and offers Robby's services in building the communication facilityThe next day Robby arrives at ship as the crew unloads the engine to power the transmitter. To lighten the tense moment the commander instructs the crane driver to pick up Cookie (Earl Holliman) and move him out of the way. Quinn interrupts the practical joke to report that the assembly is complete and they can transmit in the morning.Meanwhile Cookie goes looking for Robby and organizes for the robot to synthesize some bourbon. Robby takes a sample and tells Cookie he can have 60 gallons ready the next morning for him.Farman continues to court Altair by teaching her how to kiss and the health benefits of kissing. Adams interrupts the exercise and is clearly annoyed with a mix of jealous. He then explains to Altair that the clothes she wears are inappropriate around his crew. Altair tries to argue till Adams looses patience and order Altair to leave the area.That night Altair still furious explains to her father what occurred. Altair takes Adams advice to heart and orders Robby to run up a less revealing dress. Meanwhile back at the ship two security guards think they hear breathing in the darkness but see nothing.Inside the ship one of the crew half asleep sees the inner hatch opened and some material moved around. Next morning the Captain holds court on the events of the night before. Quinn advises the captain that most of the missing and damaged equipment can be replaced except for the Clystron monitor. Angry the Capt. and Doc go back to Morbius to confront him about what has occurred.Morbius is unavailable so the two men settle in to wait. Outside Adams sees Altair swimming and goes to speak to her. Thinking she is naked Adams becomes flustered and unsettled till he realizes she wants him to see her new dress. Altair asks why Adams wont kiss her like everyone else has. He gives in and plants one on her. Behind them a tiger emerges from the forest and attacks Altair Adams reacts by shooting it. Altair is badly troubled by the incident; the tiger had been her friend but she can't understand why it acted as if she was an enemy.Returning to the house Doc and Adams accidentally open Morbius' office. They find a series of strange drawings but no sign of Morbius. He appears through a secret door and is outraged at the intrusion. Adams explains the damage done to the ship the previous night and his concern that Morbius was behind the attack.Morbius admits it is time for explanations. He goes on to tell them about a race of creatures that lived on the planet called the Krell. In the past they had visited Earth which explains why there are Earth animals on the planet. Morbius believes the Krell civilization collapsed in a single night right on the verge of their greatest discovery. Today 2000 centuries later nothing of their cities exists above ground.Morbius then takes them on a tour of the Krell underground installation. Morbius first shows them a device for projecting their knowledge; he explains how he began to piece together information. Then an education device that projects images formed in the mind. Finally he explains what the Krell were expected to do and how much lower human intelligence is in comparison.Doc tries the intelligence tester but is confused when it does not register as high as Morbius. Morbius then explains it can also boost intelligence and that the captain of the Belleraphon died using it. Morbius himself was badly injured but when he recovered his IQ had doubled.Adams questions why all the equipment looks brand new. It is explained that all the machines left on the planet are self repairing and Morbius takes them on a tour of the rest of the installation. First they inspect a giant air vent that leads to the core of the planet. There are 400 other such shafts in the area and 9200 thermal reactors spread through the facilities 8000 cubic miles.Later that night the crew has completed the security arrangements and tests the force field fence. Cookie asks permission to go outside the fence. He meets Robby who gives him the 60 gallons of bourbon.
Outside something hits the fence and shorts it out. The security team checks the breach but finds nothing. A series of foot-like depressions begin forming leading to the ship. Something unseen enters the ship. A scream echos through the compound.Back at the Morbius residence he argues that only he should be allowed to control the flow of Krell technology back to Earth. In the middle of the discussion Adams is paged and told that the Chief Quinn has been murdered. Adams breaks off his discussions and heads back to the ship.Later that night Doc finds the footprints and makes a cast. The foot makes no evolutionary sense. It seems to have elements of a four footed and biped creature; also it seems to be both a predator and herbivore. Adams questions Cookie who was with the robot during the test and decides the robot was not responsible.The next day at the funeral for Chief Morbius again warns him of impending doom facing the ship and crew. Adams considers this a challenge and spends the day fortifying the position around the ship. After testing the weapons and satisfied all that could be done has the radar station suddenly reports movement in the distance moving slowly towards the ship.No one sees anything despite the weapons being under radar fire control. The controller confirms a direct hit but the object is still moving towards the ship. Suddenly something hits the force field fence and a huge monster appears outlined in the energy flux. The crew open fire but seem to do little good. A number of men move forward but are quickly killed.Morbius wakes hearing the screams of Altair. She's had a dream mimicking the attack that has just occurred. As Morbius is waking the creature in the force field disappears. Doc theorizes that the creature is made of some sort of energy renewing itself second by second.Adams takes Doc in the tractor to visit Morbius intending to evacuate him from the planet. He leaves orders for the ship to be readied for liftoff. If he and Doc dont get back the ship is to leave without them. They also want to try and break into Morbius' office and take the brain booster test.They are met at the door by Robby who disarms them. Altair appears and countermands the orders given to Robby by her father. Seeing a chance Doc sneaks into the office. Altair argues with Adams about trying to make Morbius return home; she ultimately declares her love for him.Robby appears carrying the injured Doc. Struggling to speak and in heavy pain Doc explains that the Krell succeeded in their great experiment. However they forgot about the subconscious monsters they would release. Monsters from the id.Morbius sees the dead body of Doc and makes a series of ugly comments. His daughter reminds him that Doc is dead. Morbius' lack of care convinces Altair she is better off going with Adams. Morbius tries to talk Adams out of taking Altair.Adams demands an explanation of the id. Morbius realizes he is the source of the creature killing everyone. The machine the Krell built was able to release his inner beast the subconscious monster dwelling deep inside his ancestral mind.Robby interrupts the debate to report something approaching the house. Morbius triggers the defensive shields of the house which the creature begins to destroy. Morbius then orders Robby to destroy the creature; however Robby short circuits. Adams explained that it was useless; Robby knew it was Morbius himself.Adams Altair and Morbius retreat to the Krell lab and seal themselves in by sealing a special indestructible door. Adams convinces Morbius that he is really the monster and that Morbius cannot actually control his subconscious desires.The group watch as the creature beings the slow process of burning through the door. Panicked Morbius implores Altair to say it is not so. Suddenly the full realization comes and he understands that he could endanger or even kill Altair.As the creature breaks through Morbius rushes forward and denies its existence. Suddenly the creature disappears but Morbius is mortally wounded. With his dying breath he instructs Adams to trigger a self destruct mechanism linked to the reactors of the great machine. The ship and crew have 24 hours to get as far away from the planet as possibleThe next day we see the ship deep in space. Robby and Altair are onboard watching as the planet brightens and is destroyed. Adams assures Altair that her father's memory will shine like a beacon."

Mexican businessman Samuel Ramos (Marc Anthony) discusses this incident with his attorney Jordan Kalfus (Mickey Rourke) as it has convinced Ramos' wife Lisa (Radha Mitchell) that they need to hire a bodyguard for their nine-year-old daughter Lupita ""Pita"" Ramos (Dakota Fanning). Ramos is reluctant to do this and it is implied that he is having financial problems as Pita had a bodyguard until recently but they had to let him go. Kalfus reminds Ramos that he needs to hire another bodyguard in order to renew the family's ransom insurance and recommends he talk to Paul Rayburn (Christopher Walken) a former CIA agent who now runs an executive security firm. Rayburn refers the family to his old CIA buddy John Creasy (Denzel Washington).Ramos is impressed with Creasy's rsum which includes a variety of counterinsurgency and counter-terrorism activities. However Creasy is burned out from all the death and horror and has taken to alcoholism to ease the burden. He even attempts suicide which fails when his gun misfires. Rayburn attributes this to a bullet's tendency to find its way to truly deserving targets. Creasy is not interested in bodyguard work and even less with the youngster but he needs a job. Creasy's initial impatience slowly fades as he finds himself opening up to the child. He replaces her parents in their absence giving her advice and coaching her in her swimming lessons and competitions. He helps her overcome her fear of the sound of starter pistols turning it into an eagerness to move at the sound of one. Pita gives Creasy an emblem of St. Jude the patron saint of lost causes saying she bought it for him with her own money.Shortly after delivering her to a piano audition Creasy notices a suspicious vehicle driving past and a pair of police cars blocking off the surrounding street. As Pita emerges from the building and freezes Creasy pulls out his gun and fires a shot into the air similar to a starter pistol startling her into running away. During the ensuing gun battle four of the attackers are fatally shot including two corrupt police officers. The battle leaves Creasy seriously wounded and unconscious allowing the surviving kidnappers to grab the child.The police chief publicly ridicules Creasy while he is unconscious in the hospital claiming he murdered the two police officers. A journalist Mariana Guerrero (Rachel Ticotin) finds it suspicious that the cops were supposed to be off duty yet were in uniform and driving squad cars. Her Federal Ministerial Police contact Miguel Manzano (Giancarlo Giannini) matter of factly states that the cops were corrupt. They decide to talk to Creasy once he has recovered.Although Kalfus wants the police kept out of the negotiation for Pita's release the death of the two officers make the kidnapping a police matter so Fuentes takes charge assuring the family that the chances of Pita's safe return are good as long as they listen to him. Soon after Sanchez demands a dead drop ransom of ten million dollars in exchange for Pita. Although Ramos is instructed to come to the drop alone Fuentes advises against this and accompanies Ramos to the drop. The drop goes badly as the kidnappers are ambushed and Ramos and Fuentes are forced to flee. A furious Sanchez reveals that his nephew was killed in the ambush and he blames this on Ramos disobeying his instructions. He says that Pita is lost to them forever which is assumed to mean she is dead.Rayburn learns about Creasy's situation and helps Creasy escape to a safe house where he can recover from his injuries. After Creasy is well he returns to Pita's home and promises Lisa that he will kill everyone who was involved in or profited from the kidnapping. With help from Guerrero and Manzano Creasy learns that the corrupt cops belong to a powerful crime syndicate called La Hermandad (Spanish for ""the Brotherhood""). Creasy kidnaps and tortures several Brotherhood members forcing them to reveal the names of the people involved in the kidnapping ring including Fuentes. With help from Guerrero he learns that Fuentes will be travelling through the city in a high security motorcade. Using a hotel room as a sniper's nest Creasy uses a rocket launcher to destroy the armored vehicles escorting Fuentes' limo then heads down to the street to engage the remaining guards. After a protracted shootout with Creasy using advanced guerilla warfare tactics Creasy hijacks the limo and knocks Fuentes out.Under interrogation Fuentes reveals that he ambushed the dead drop because he had had organized so many of them in the past he thought it would be easy money. However the bags stolen from the drop only contained 2.5 million a quarter of the actual ransom. Fuentes begs to be spared insisting that he is just a hired professional like Creasy. A disgusted Creasy reveals that he planted an explosive within Fuentes' rectum while he was unconscious and it will explode in five minutes. As Creasy walks away Fuentes spends the last few minutes of his life screaming until the explosive detonates killing him.Creasy traces another 2.5 million to Kalfus and goes to his house to confront him only to find his decapitated body floating in a pool. He confronts Ramos who admits that he was danger of going bankrupt so Kalfus suggested they stage Pita's kidnapping so he could collect the insurance money. Kalfus had made most of the arrangements and assured Ramos that Pita would simply be watching cartoons in a safehouse for a few hours. Things went south once Fuentes got too greedy Ramos blamed Kalfus for this and had him executed. Creasy leaves a pistol (the same one from his failed suicide attempt) and a single bullet on the table reiterating Rayburn's earlier advice about bullets always finding deserving targets. After Creasy and Lisa leave Ramos uses the gun to kill himself.As Creasy continues his pursuit of Sanchez Manzano's men are tracking him electronically. Guerrero prepares to publish Sanchez' photo in the newspaper but is attacked on the way home by a gang member who threatens to kill her if she publishes the picture. The paper publishes it anyway and the headlines label it ""Tiene Vo el Miedo"" (""Fear has a Voice"").After Creasy learns where Sanchez' brother Aurelio (Gero Camilo) lives he gains access to his apartment. Aurelio wounds Creasy in the chest but Creasy is able to chase him. Aurelio attempts to escape in a VW bus but Creasy wounds him and he crashes into a large truck. Creasy takes Aurelio back to his apartment and captures Sanchez' very pregnant wife Raina. He tortures Aurelio and forces Raina to page Sanchez who then calls back.Creasy is intent on killing Sanchez when Sanchez reveals that Pita is still alive. He offers to release her if Creasy surrenders himself and lets Aurelio live. Creasy agrees and takes Lisa to a remote rural area to make the exchange. After Pita runs to her mother Aurelio and Creasy get into a car which speeds off. In the back seat Creasy dies from his gunshot wound and drops the emblem of St. Jude that Pita gave him. An epilogue reveals that Sanchez was killed by Manzano during a police raid that same day."

Domino was hired by the owner of the Stratosphere Casino to find out where the thieves hid the money.In a flashback Domino says she and her team were sent to the Fender Compound out in the desert. An RV with shark's mouth livery is seen rolling into a junkyard type property. Domino and two men all armed with shotguns get out. They approach a trailer home warily. The woman inside fires at them. Ed Moseby (Mickey Rourke) is the best bounty hunter in L.A. and tries to get the woman Edna Fender to give up the money. The other bounty hunter Choco (Edgar Ramirez) throws a dismembered arm close to the woman. They tell her it is her son's Choco then goes back to the RV where a group of men are watching TV. Choco grabs the man with one arm and marches him back to the trailer home. Edna is distraught but still has a weapon. The arm has a combination tattooed on it and Locus pleads with his mother to get the ""decoder""Title sequence and theme song.Back in the trailer home Edna uses the tattooed numbers and a homemade pie plate decoder to figure out the lock combination of a padlocked fridge. Ed and Domino have a beer and relax while Edna calculates.At an L.A. DMV office a young man Frances (Kel O'Neill) speaks to someone on his phone. His number is called and he goes to a woman's counter. He gives her a piece of paper with photos and Social Security numbers he needs the IDs that night.

They load up with bulletpoof vests and shotguns. Ed and Domino storm into the house where they are confronted by the alert 18th Street gang everyone has guns drawn and ready to shoot. Hector had escaped already. Domino imagines a bloody ending but then defuses the situation by offering to do a lap dance if they give up Hector.

"The movie opens with Yang Tieh caring for his elderly teacher. The teacher is very ill and the treatments Yang Tieh administers are ceasing to be effective. Teacher believes that his time is up and he is dying. He tells Yang Tieh that there is no longer time to put off what he needs Yang Tieh to do. He has been instructing Yang in the ""Poison Clan"" Kung-Fu technique but he is dying now. He tells Yang that he had other pupils besides Yang and is deeply concerned about what they are doing. Poison Clan kung-fu can be used to harm and oppress people for many evil puposes. Many clan members have done so earning the clan its bad reputation. Teacher tells Yang that he must tell him more about the previous pupils.Yang and Teacher descend into a dungeon-like area under the main room. Various training tools and structures all old and delapidated sit here each with a large emblem of a different poisonous beast on the wall nearby. Teacher says he had five previous pupils. Number 1 studied the Centipede style known for its exceptional speed of movement (he is shown rapidly smashing small plates dropping from the ceiling most before they hit the floor). Number 2 studied the Snake style known also for speed and for its agility (Snake is shown smashing ceramic pots and moving limbo-style under a rack smashing rungs out from underneath it). Number 3 studied the Scorpion style based on the hands moving like scorpion pincers and powerful kicking techniques (Scorpion is shown practicing these kicks and smashing wooden targets on high poles). Number 4 studied the Lizard style which is agile and nimble and enables a man to climb like a lizard (he is shown running up walls and snuffing out candles). Number 5 studied the Toad style which is based on power and resilience and is near-invincible against physical harm (Toad is shown lying on a bed of spikes pushing wooden spikes with his bare chest and using forearm smashes to bend sheets of solid metal).Teacher explains that the pupils always wore masks while training and changed their names after finishing. Moreover they did not all train together-- Number 1 and 2 studied with him at the same time and knew each other. Number 3 studied alone afterward and never met any of the others. Numbers 4 and 5 studied together after Number 3 left and knew each other but never met the first three. Number 4 Lizard was the oldest of the pupils. They will all use their skills only in times of dire need making it even harder to find and identify them.Yang has studied the basics of all five styles but has not specialized in any of them and thus his skills aren't enough to defeat the five pupils on his own. Teacher tells him that only be allying with at least one pupil who is not using his skills for bad purposes can he hope to defeat any of the others who are. He makes Yang promise to locate the five pupils and make sure they are not using their skills for evil. Any who are must be faced.Teacher has one lead for Yang. He had a colleague who used to be a fellow Poison Clan teacher. He is living quietly in a nearby town under an assumed name. He has a lot of money made from Poison Clan activities. Teacher wants Yang to find this colleague and convince him to donate the money to a charity. The five pupils know about this money and may try to gain it for themselves. The colleague although skilled in kung-fu would not be a match for them.Yang makes his way to a small town keeping his eyes and ears open. He notes that a police officer He Yuan-Xin (though the surname is clearly dubbed 'Ho' in the English-language DVD) is very well-liked among the townspeople. He watches Officer Ho on patrol with his captain Ma Chow who seems polite and reasonably friendly but more businesslike than Ho.(space to be filled in later)Captain Ma is heading home in the evening when he passes by the workplace of an elderly scribe Mr. Yuen. Yuen is clearly a well-liked and respected man throughout much of the town. Ma checks in on him and makes sure he is all right. Yuen is working a bit late that night but plans to head home soon.On arriving home Yuen finds his entire family being held captive by two mysterious men who turn out to be Snake and Centipede. They are sure that Mr. Yuen is the fellow Poison Clan teacher who has the Clan's fortune. Snake and Centipede become a bit too overzealous in their interrogation of Mr. Yuen and beat him to death. Frustrated and intending to leave no witnesses they slaughter Yuen's entire family including the women and children and leave empty-handed. As they are leaving a town gambler and drunk named Won Fa spots Snake and Centipede. He barely manages to hide before they see him paralyzed with fear.Some time later Scorpion stealthily arrives at the Yuen's home. We do not see Scorpion's face as he is wearing his school training mask. He looks over the slain family and notices that Yuen is clasping a single candle in his hands. Taking the candle he breaks it in half and finds a small piece of parchment inside which he secretes into his clothing before leaving.When the bodies are discovered the police begin investigation. The local judge is under pressure to have the case solved and closed promptly due to Mr. Yuen's highly respected position in the town. He puts the police under deadline after which they will all be whipped each additional day it takes. Ho has a couple of ideas and asks for some leave for official purposes.Officer Ho is discussing the case with his friend. They believe one of the Clan members may be responsible. Ho is now certain that Mr. Yuen was the Clan teacher who had the Clan fortune and he was killed for the money. Suddenly Ho hears a slight noise outside the room where he and his friend are talking. He pulls open a casement causing Yang to stumble in. Yang reveals that he has learned that Won Fa saw the Yuen family's killer.Cut to Won Fa being hauled into the police station. A kettle of hot tea is poured over his face to intimidate him. But then Officer Ho offers him a piece of silver in return for what he saw at the Yuen family's house. Instantly much more talkative Won Fa says he saw a heavily bearded man come out of Yuen's house. Ho and several of the police know the man as a good friend of Qi Dong (dubbed Mr. Hung in the English language DVD) a wealthy aristocrat who is well-connected with local government officials.Ho is again speaking with his friend who says he's also seen the bearded man. They are wondering if he is the Centipede Snake or Scorpion. Ho tells his friend that he needs to assist the police with the man's capture. When Ho speaks to the police about the plan Ma is skeptical. Ho assures his fellow officers that his friend is a first-class kung-fu expert.Ho goes to visit. Mr. Hung the next day dropping a subtle hint suggesting that Hung is involved somehow with the Poison Clan. Hung's face clearly changes but he pretends not to understand.Meanwhile Ma and the police are waiting for Hung's bearded friend Zhang Yiao-Tian (his name is dubbed just as Tian in the English-language DVD). Yang Tieh is hiding nearby to watch. The police surround Tian but cannot capture him. Finally Officer Ho's friend steps out of a door and identifies himself as Liang Shen (though the English language DVD clearly gives a dubbing of 'Li Ho.') and accuses Tian of the Yuen family's murder. Tian leaps at Li swinging a sword he'd seized from one of the police officers. Li doesn't budge and the sword bounces off his naked arm revealing him as Clan member number 5-- the Toad. Tian must use his Centipede skills to fight Li revealing his own identity to Li and the police. Centipede and Toad battle in a well-choreographed kung-fu scene. Toad defeats Centipede grappling him so the police can place him in chains and shackles. Ma asks Li to come to court but Li says it's not necessary.Yang walks off having learned that the Toad and Centipede are in the town but he doesn't yet know of any of the others.(space to be filled in at a later date)Li is placed in the Iron Maiden. Just as it is closed he regains consciousness and busts out of the device his body unmarked and unharmed. He chastises the police for their contraption understanding what it is for and saying he doesn't have a weak spot. The police cannot contain Li. Then Hung emerges from behind a curtain and engages Li in combat using his Snake technique. Li notes the snake design on Hung's wristlets and understands who he is and that he's behind the plot to frame Li. Snake and Toad battle in another kung-fu scene. Snake uses his skills to probe the Toad's body trying to find the weak spot. Toad is starting to get the better of the battle when suddenly two metal darts hit him from behind sticking behind his ears. The darts are shaped like scorpions. Toad understands that the Scorpion is somewhere in the courtroom but he cannot determine where. Snake begins to laugh and hits Toad hard in the same spots behind his ears. Li's Toad-style kung-fu is broken and he is now helpless. The police put him in the Iron Maiden again and the judge demands he confess. Li simply passes out and falls unconscious. When he is removed from the Iron Maiden his body is covered with puncture wounds.(space to be filled in at a later date)Officer Ho returns to town. Ma finds him at police headquarters brooding and angry. He's learned that Tian was acquitted of the Yuen family's murder and Li was convicted. He interrogates Ma about the turn of events and Ma merely says that the case is now closed and Li's crimes confirmed. Ho wants to see Li but Ma says Li killed himself.Ho storms off to the tavern and orders all the patrons to leave. He begins to drink heavily when some of his fellow officers approach him showing him the money they were given by Mr. Hung. They explain that Li was suffocated by an officer named Ling Xuong after his kung-fu was broken by a device called the Iron Maiden (Ho's face changes to show he's heard of the device and understands why it was used). They also reveal how Won Fa and Officer Ling were eliminated as witnesses and collateral damage-- Won Fa was killed with a hook that was shoved down his throat and Officer Ling was killed with a long sharp needle that punctured his brain. Ho gives them back the bribe money so they can escape town quietly in the evening.He begins to drink again when he spots Yang Tieh watching him. Yang simply smiles and reveals Officer Ho as Clan member number 4 the Lizard. He gives Officer Ho a Poison Clan password to show he's with the Clan. They go off to find privacy to talk.Yang explains how he figured out that Officer Ho was the Lizard. He also reveals that while drinking and gambling with various officers in the police force he learned that Toad's kung-fu wasn't broken by the Iron Maiden but by the Scorpion. They both know that Yuen was the second Poison Clan teacher and was murdered for the Clan's fortune. It wasn't removed from his home so Yuen must have had a map showing where the fortune is hidden.Officer Ho brings Yang to a secret area in town where he trains and keeps his Lizard-style technique sharp. Having training in all five main styles of the Poison clan Yang shares his knowledge of the Centipede Snake and Scorpion styles devising strategies for himself and Officer Ho to fight against them. They practice and hone these strategies well into the night. Since he is combining with the Lizard Yang's battle strategy will involve using his own Lizard skills.The next day they are headed to Mr. Hung's mansion to confront and kill him and Tian. They find Captain Ma waiting for them on the way. Ma wants to help out. He understands what they want to do and believes that Hung and Tian will be tough to beat. Because of his friendship with Ma Officer Ho agrees. As they start out again Officer Ho notes that Ma is not wearing his police uniform. Ma states he's resigned from the force. Officer Ho decides that he will quit as well pulling off his uniform hat and shirt and dropping them in the street.As they arrive Hung looks closely at Ma and states ""I wasn't expecting three."" Officer Ho calls Tian out and states his knowledge that Tian is the Centipede and Hung is the Snake. Lizard and Yang begin the big kung-fu battle with Centipede and Snake; the battle raging throughout the mansion and revealing Officer Ho's identity as the Lizard to Hung Tian and Ma (we see Ma looking intently at Ho for a moment). During the battle Tian is hurt and Lizard and Yang are able to team up against Snake. Frustrated and clearly on the losing end Hung demands to know why Ma is just standing by and watching saying he knows who Ma is.Understanding that his cover is blown Ma suddenly lunges into the fight with a kung-fu kick that reveals himself as Clan member number 3 the Scorpion. In the sudden confusion Hung turns and tries to run away but Ma opens two hidden compartments on his belt where he stores his scorpion-shaped darts and hurls a handful of them into Hung's back. He demands to know how long Hung has known about him. Hung answers that he spotted Ma throwing the darts that broke Toad's kung-fu in the court battle. In answer Ma throws another handful of darts that hit Hung in the chest and stomach. Officer Ho is aghast admitting he was completely fooled. He understands that Ma as the Scorpion was seeking the Clan fortune for himself and looking to kill all his fellow Clan members so they couldn't pursue him for it. His demeanor completely changed in an instant Ma admits to all of this and that he has Mr. Yuen's Clan fortune.Yang and Lizard engage Scorpion in battle. Holding them off but knowing he can't take them both by himself Scorpion calls to a recovered Centipede to assist him. When an appeal to logic (that Yang was sent by Teacher to hunt them down and will kill them both if given a chance) fails Scorpion bribes him with half the money. That gets Centipede's attention and he rejoins the fight. Splitting Scorpion and Centpide up Llzard and Yang fight to the best of their ability.Meanwhile Snake is pulling the scorpion darts out of his chest and stomach and pulls himself to his feet coming up behind Scorpion who is starting to get the better of his battle against Yang. Snake strikes from behind bursting Scorpion's stomach and abdomen. Scorpion instantly kills Snake with a high kick over his shoulder that smashes into Snake's forehead. But the damage to Scorpion is done. Lizard and Yang climb a wall fending Scorpion off and allowing him to exert himself to where he dies of his wounds and blood loss.Centipede scrambles to try and find a clue to the Yuen fortune on Scorpion's body but Lizard and Yang are waiting. Putting their strategy against the Centipede style into use they finish Tian off and kill him.The battle over Lizard pats Scorpion's body down and finds the map showing where Yuen hid the Poison Clan fortune. A disgusted Yang says they should kill the corrupt judge as well but Lizard says that if they do this the next one could be worse and that the killing must stop some time. The best course of action is to use the map to find the money and use it well as their Teacher wanted to pay the Clan's debts. The movie closes with Lizard and Yang leaving the mansion and the bodies of Centipede Snake and Scorpion inside to carry out Teacher's wishes.

"As the movie opens we see a guy climbing along the underside of an outcropping from a tall mountain peak. He turns out to be Gabe Walker a ranger with Rocky Mountain Rescue. He is in communication with his co-worker and girlfriend Jessie who is on a chopper piloted by an older co-worker Frank. The three are mounting a rescue of yet another co-worker Hal Tucker and his girlfriend Sarah who is on her first climb. Hal and Sarah made it to the top of the mountain but Hal has aggravated an old knee injury and can't make it back down.Gabe makes it to the top of the peak where Hal and Sarah are. The chopper drops Gabe a cable which he secures while the chopper lands on a nearby peak. All is set for the three to shuttle across the cable to where the chopper is. There is a lot of light-hearted banter as this is a routine operation that they all (except Sarah) do all the time. Hal goes first and as he is crossing Gabe asks Sarah how Hal persuaded her to accompany him on this escapade. She replies laconically ""He told me it's better than sex.""Hal makes it across and now it's Sarah's turn. She is a little frightened at the thought of hanging from a cable 4000 feet above the ground but the fact that Hal crossed without incident is reassuring. Halfway across one of the buckles on her harness snaps and suddenly she is hanging by a strap and unable to reach and grab onto the cable. Gabe quickly crosses to her and grabs her arm just as the strap breaks free. But they are unable to keep their grip on each other and Sarah falls 4000 feet to her death. Both Gabe and Hal are devastated. The story jumps ahead eight months. At the U.S. Treasury office in Denver Treasury Agent Travers is preparing to leave on a flight with several large containers of printed currency totaling $100000000. His boss introduces FBI Agent Matheson who is being transferred and is bumming a ride on the flight. Gabe meanwhile drives up to Jessie's (and formerly his) house. He had left after Sarah's funeral because he felt he had to get away and has been working in Denver. He wants Jessie to come to Denver with him but she won't. She leaves for work leaving Gabe to get his stuff from the house and load it into his vehicle.On the plane Matheson looks out his window and sees another plane flying next to them. He quickly and correctly sizes up the situation informs the other two Treasury agents that Travers intends to hijack the plane and pulls his gun on Travers. The other two agents dutifully pull their guns on Matheson as does Travers. Travers shoots the other two agents then shoots Matheson. In the cockpit the co-pilot comments about the gunfire and the pilot shoots him. The two planes move into position and run a cable between them. Travers transfers over then the pilot sends the containers.But Matheson isn't dead. He manages to shoot the pilot shoot the cable in enough places that it detaches from both planes and the containers fall to the ground and shoot the other plane enough times that it crashes in the mountains before his own plane explodes from explosives previously set by Travers. Kristel the pilot of the other plane radios for help reaches Jessie Hal and Frank desperately tells them they are hikers who got lost in a snowstorm and asks them to send a chopper. But they can't send a chopper because of the storm so Hal sets off to climb to their location.Jessie goes back to the house and tries to persuade Gabe to help Hal but Gabe makes some excuses about not having climbed in so long and drives away. Meanwhile in Denver Treasury agents are discussing the fate of their plane when some FBI agents arrive and inform them that Matheson wasn't just along for the ride he was investigating. Seems that one Eric Qualen a former military intelligence operative has been plotting to hijack one of these Treasury shipments. Although the bills are in denominations that aren't distributed and therefore wouldn't have any value to the ordinary thief Qualen has the international connections to dispose of these bills profitably. FBI shows Treasury and us Qualen's picture and sure enough it's the head bad guy from the second plane.We now find Gabe who apparently has reconsidered since talking with Jessie climbing up the side of a cliff. At a level point halfway up he meets up with Hal (who still blames Gabe for Sarah's death and isn't particularly thrilled to see him) and they climb to the top where they are captured by Qualen's party. The three money containers have tracking devices and Qualen intends for Hal and Gabe to guide them to each of the three locations. They reach a point several hundred feet below the first one and send Gabe up to get it. Qualen insists that Gabe leave his coat behind limiting his chances to escape. When Hal warns Gabe the bad guys plan to kill him when he comes down the bad guys start shooting at Gabe triggering an avalanche that sweeps the money container over the edge where it pops open and sends $33.33 million worth of bills floating through the air and down into the valley below.Meanwhile Jessie having grown suspicious over inconsistencies in Hal's radio communication has Frank drop her off up in the mountains where she meets up with Gabe. They manage to reach the second container before the bad guys who arrive to find not the money but a note offering to trade the money for Hal. Qualen realizes it's Gabe and night having fallen sends a bad guy out with night vision goggles. This guy finds Gabe and Jessie but Gabe temporarily blinds him by flashing a flare in his night-vision-sensitive face. The two wrestle and end up sliding down a long slope. At the last second Gabe is able to anchor himself while his adversary goes over the edge. Watching all this from his higher vantage point Hal comments ""Gravity's a bitch isn't it?"" The bad guys fail to see the humor.It being night on a snowy mountain Gabe and Jessie use the money to make a fire Gabe commenting on how expensive it is to heat the place. Come daybreak they try to reach the third container before Qualen's group but their way is blocked by a series of explosions set off by Qualen. One of the bad guys corners them in a cave that was part of their shortcut but Gabe is able to kill him by impaling him on a stalactite. There is also a scene where a rope breaks and Gabe ends up holding on to the side of a cliff with one hand and Jessie with the other. There is a close-up of their hands holding onto each other that looks very much like Gabe and Sarah's hands at the beginning but they manage to maintain their grip until Gabe pulls Jessie to safety.Meanwhile the Qualen group encounters a couple of Bill and Ted wannabes and starts shooting at them killing one and wounding the other as he parachutes off a ledge. Frank finds the survivor and decides he'd better find out what is going on. He soon discovers the Qualen party and lands the chopper in order to rescue them only to be shot and killed for his trouble. At this point Travers wants to forget the money and just get away in the chopper. Qualen demands the tracking device which Travers gives him but he refuses to tell him the passcode (knowing that if Qualen knew the passcode he'd have no need to keep Travers alive). Travers pulls a gun on Qualen but Qualen comments that they can't use the chopper without a pilot shoots and kills his pilot Kristel (who is apparently in love with him; Qualen tells her that the essence of love is sacrifice as he pulls the trigger) and observes that now he is the only one left who can fly the chopper. He orders Travers to take his tracking device and go find the money and bring it back to the chopper. Travers sets off with Hal and the only other remaining bad guy (the one who just shot Frank).Gabe sends Jessie back for help and sets off to find the last container getting there before Travers and stuffing the money in his backpack. When Travers realizes he is close and doesn't need a guide anymore he tells his companion to kill Hal but Hal manages to kill him first. Travers sees his companion's body sailing down from the ledge and thinks it's Hal although it doesn't seem to phase him that he never sees either of them again. His tracking device leads him to a rabbit wearing the device from the last container. Travers a bureaucrat who has watched a seemingly foolproof plan completely unravel is by now essentially insane. He begins erratically shooting at the rabbit repeatedly missing it even at close range.Travers radios that he is going to look for Gabe alarming Qualen by revealing information about their identities that might be of interest to searchers. Qualen concerned that someone might have located the origin of the transmission takes off in the chopper. Travers finds Gabe (or vice versa it's hard to tell) on a wooden bridge over a mountain stream and in the struggle that follows Gabe falls through the ice and into the freezing cold water. Travers spots Gabe under the ice trying to break through to the surface and draws his gun but Gabe draws his own climbing gun and fires through the ice killing Travers. Hal shows up and helps Gabe out of the icy water.Jessie sees the chopper and thinking that it is Frank waves for help. Qualen captures her and radios Gabe and Hal that he has her demands the money and they agree on a rendezvous point. At the rendezvous Qualen demands that Gabe throw the money into the chopper or he'll shoot Jessie but Gabe says that if he does he'll throw the money over the cliff. Qualen relents and drops Jessie off nearby and returns for the money but Gabe throws it into the chopper blades and as Qualen struggles to regain control Gabe attaches the chopper's winch to the top of a metal ladder running down the side of the mountain while Hal shoots at the chopper until it loses power and falls. It pulls the top part of the ladder off of its attachments and ends up dangling on the side of the cliff. Gabe who had taken refuge on the ladder to avoid Qualen's gunfire falls and lands on the chopper where he and Qualen engage in a fistfight. As the rest of the ladder gives way Gabe jumps off and grasps the side of the cliff while the chopper with Qualen in it falls 4000 feet and explodes on impact.Hal and Jessie toss Gabe a rope and help him to the top. They are then contacted by Treasury agents in a chopper who have been monitoring radio communications for the last little while. They tell the trio that they will be back to pick them up shortly. The movie ends with Gabe Hal and Jessie sitting on top of a mountain peak looking very much like Gabe Hal and Sarah at the beginning."

"Jake Green (Jason Statham) is in prison in solitary confinement for seven years. He has two mysterious characters serving solitary in cells on either side of him (one a con man the other a chess master). While in solitary Jake and the other two exchange thoughts on chess and the perfect con via handwritten messages slipped inside of provisional books that the three share. Jake comes to learn the makings of a perfect con but never fully grasps its depth and relevancy to him until much much later. In the course of these exchanges Jake reveals a lot about himself to the other two. Jake never meets these two men face to face. The two prisoners plan to break out of prison and agree to break Jake out as well. The next day the two escape leaving Jake behind. He feels cheated.Jake remains in prison while the two escaped convicts steal all the money Jake had hidden ""on the outside"". They trusted Jake with the formula; Jake trusted them as to the whereabouts of his money...a LOT of money. They take the money leaving in its place a message on a card:The first rule of any game - YOU CAN ONLY GET SMARTER BY PLAYING A SMARTER OPPONENT.Cut to two years later.When Jake gets out of prison broke and penniless he starts to practice what he understands of the formula and of the con he learned from his time in solitary. Its very successful and he does very well in world of gambling he seemingly learned a valuable lesson from the two conmen inside.Once Jake is up on his feet again (financially speaking) he takes on his nemesis the power hungry Dorothy Macha (Ray Liotta). Jake enters Macha's casino with his brothers in tow and is swiftly summoned before Macha to play a game of chance. En route to Macha's game they must take an elevator up 22 floors where it is revealed Jake suffers from extreme claustrophobia following his years in solitary and must suppress an anxiety attack to make the journey. At the game Jake beats him in a game of chance humiliating Macha. Fearing more of the same Macha wants revenge and orders a hit on Jake. As Jake and his brothers leave the casino Jake is approached by a mysterious man (Zach) who offers him assistance and hands him a note reading ""take the elevator."" Jake cannot face the return journey and opts to take the stairs but blacks out unexpectedly falls down the stairs and is rushed to the hospital. The doctors report he is very ill but do not disclose why he had the blackout. Macha puts out the order for a hit on Jake asking professional killer Sorter (Mark Strong) to take care of things. Jake arrives home without Billy to be welcomed by one of Macha's hits. Jake is the only one who survives being rescued by the mysterious Zach. Sorter is confounded by Jake's escape and survival unaccustomed to his hits going wrong which instigates a quiet intense process of self-questioning in the otherwise passionless killer.Zach takes Jake to his equally mysterious partner Avi who produces the results of his hospital tests and informs him that he is in desperate physical trouble from an internal disease with only three days to live. He tells Jake he and his partner can save him from both Macha and his physical aliment.Simultaneously Macha is trying to get into business with the infamous but apparently invisible Sam Gold. He makes a deal with his female representative Lily Walker (who represents the queen on the chess board). Macha is warned if he does not come through on the deal that Sam Gold will be very disappointed. Macha is after the reward of being in business with Gold (who represents the opponent) and foresees no problem.The deal is for some white powder which represents vice of multiple manifestations in other words false ways to escape the wrath of Gold or win the game but perversely these just bring you closer to him.Jake agrees to do whatever the two mysterious characters tell him to do (a gun to the head so to speak - he has three days to live) there is no time to haggle and he is prepared to do whatever he's told by these characters. Avi (Andr Benjamin) and Zach (Vincent Pastore) appear to be loan sharks and gradually force Jake to give away all his money that he made using the con much to his despair. This is so painful that it seems to be killing a part of him as Avi and Zach force him to do whatever he hates to do. Jake is repeatedly forced into elevators taking him on a physiological and psychological ride from hell. They also sabotage Macha's deal with Gold putting Macha in jeopardy with Gold and forcing Macha to seek the powder from a rival crime boss Lord Jon (Tom Wu). To make matters worse they sabotage the deal with Lord Jon to make it appear that each gang is responsible for the treachery. These two gangs begin to destroy one another through their ignorance and greed.Jake's journey climaxes when Avi and Zach now his masters ask Jake to shoot a man who didn't pay a debt. Jake refuses going against the voice in his head. This is the turning point and just when Jake has had enough he forces the two mysterious characters to reveal their game. Is he ready for the answer? What is the point of putting him through all this pain?Avi and Zach simply repeat the treasured formula that Jake learned in prison and which the audience is told at the start of the film.The first rule of any game: YOU CAN ONLY GET SMARTER BY PLAYING A SMARTER OPPONENT.Jake now realizes that he has fallen victim to this ""perfect con"" that he is actually the pawn in the game and his opponent (""Sam Gold"") resides inside Jake's head - ""the last place he would ever look"" (another component of the perfect con formula) Sam Gold is a metaphor camouflaged as fear ego evil the Devil.Now armed with this information which has been so elusive Jake goes to war with himself. He realizes the game Avi and Zach have made him play has been to diminish the Sam Gold within himself - and that is why he felt like he was dying because a part of him was.This game it seems is back to front. Jake gives away his remaining money to a charity in Dorothy Macha's name and Macha takes the credit. At this point we understand that the voice we hear in the film as a voice over is not a voice over at all it's the Sam Gold in each of the characters' heads.Macha is being fattened up by the voice in his head that encourages Macha to take the credit.To conquer the game that Jake now realizes he is in he goes to Macha and humiliates himself begging for forgiveness at the foot of his bed. This goes completely against the voice in Jake's head which is now in major agony. Leaving Macha's bedroom Jake takes an elevator that gets stuck (his worst nightmare as he is claustrophobic) but here is where a real battle takes place. Jake induces the pain ""Sam Gold"" hides behind. Sam Gold tries every technique to control and debilitate Jake but Jake is now detached enough from the voice to fall for it. ""Embrace the pain and you will win this game"" -- in doing this Jake completely sheds himself of Sam Gold. Immediately upon doing so the elevator starts up. He realizes that though free from the physical prison he knew for seven years he was still a prisoner - of his own mind. Upon facing and defeating his fear he is profoundly free.As the elevator doors open there stands a confused and angry Macha with a gun in his hand. He can't understand what game Jake is playing but Jake no longer cares about Macha. Gun or no gun Jake walks straight past Macha. Because Jake no longer fears him Macha breaks down. His ego can't handle this he falls prey to the voice he hears inside his head the voice of his own ""Sam Gold"". Still unaware of who Sam Gold really is and where he resides Macha agonizes over his knowledge that Sam Gold is going to come and get him. What he doesn't realize is that Sam Gold is already getting him - from the inside.Jake makes a large donation of money to a charity in Macha's name further conquering the Sam Gold within him while augmenting the Sam Gold within Macha who happily takes the credit and public acclaim. Macha is at first magnanimous towards Jake following this gesture however on learning that Jake had orchestrated the sabotage on the 'powder' deals Macha orders him dead with renewed vigour. Macha's men find Jake's brother and niece at his home. While Macha's henchmen are in the process of torturing Jake's brother and threatening his little girl the previously passive Sorter concludes his process of self-questioning and steps in methodically executing all of Macha's men only to be outgunned in the end by the last surviving member of the gang who takes Jake's niece back to Macha.Jake now understanding that the mysterious characters Avi and Zach are not who he thought they were finishes a game of chess in Macha's casino with Avi. Here it is revealed that Avi could have beaten him at any time. Avi tells him one of the rules again the art is for the opponent to feed pieces to the victim to make them believe they took those pieces because they are smarter and you are dumber. Jake realizes that these are the two associates from Solitary confinement that he spent seven years living between while in prison. They promised they would break him out of prison and they did its just Jake didn't realize it was the prison of his mind and how big that prison was. Avi and Zach confide they did not help him because they liked him but because they ARE him - they are aspects or projections of his own higher self. Meanwhile Jake's Sam Gold persona grew from Jake's activities on emerging from prison fooling his enemies into thinking he was making them rich when instead he was siphoning their money away from them just as the ego grows rich from encouraging excess and a sense of entitlement in those within whom it resides.Jake confronts Macha who is holding his niece hostage. Jake continues to be unafraid of Macha who continues to be unnerved by his lack of fear - the ""Sam Gold"" inside Macha is screaming with rage pride fear while Macha himself is consumed by doubt and panic. Macha is convinced Sam Gold is coming to kill him for screwing up the 'powder' delivery and the ""Sam Gold"" within Macha - his ego - whispers ""you can't kill someone who's already dead."" Ultimately his pride and fear lead Macha to suicide rather than kill Jake or his niece. Sam Gold wins.In the end it's a story about realizing that the prison is the mind and the ego is the hidden master of that environment. The only real enemy to have ever existed is within; it is fear. The external world is determined to great degree by one's fear. Fear is the opponent in life and as you get smarter so does he. Once it's recognized for what it is it can be mastered but without recognition of this situation you are simply an unconscious slave and the game hasn't gone full circle."

"Part 2 opens with Buford Pusser's two main deputies Obra Eaker (Robert DoQui) and Grady Coker (Bruce Glover) as well as Buford's father and some of the town's citizens all wondering if Buford will seek re-election. Obra and Grady both state that there is no way Buford resigns until he either convicts or kills everyone who was involved in the ambush that led to his wife Pauline's death (in the previous movie). Buford's mother (Lurene Tuttle) and his children visit Buford who is still in the hospital recovering from plastic surgery that was needed to restore his face. Buford's mother asks him about re-election and confesses that she wishes he would retire. ""There ain't no shame in quitting Buford"" she tells him. To which he replies ""I know  Mama.""Buford (now played by Bo Svenson) is re-elected and his first order of business is to bust up a still operating on the banks of the river. Buford and his deputies surprise the moonshiners and round them all up except for Pinky Dobson (Luke Askew) who gets away in a boat. Mob boss John Witter (Logan Ramsey) is angry when Dobson brings Ray Henry (John Davis Chandler) to a meeting at his mansion. Witter makes Ray Henry wait in another room while he and Dobson talk about what to do about Buford. Witter grumbles about how Buford has cost him a lot of money by shutting down his prostitution and gambling operations. He puts pressure on Dobson to take Buford out. Dobson promises he will.Dobson goes to a race to talk to a driver named Stud Pardee (Richard Jaeckel) about helping him to get rid of Buford. Pardee strips two of Buford's lug bolts on his Impala and then entices Buford into a high-speed car chase. Buford's wheel does come off during the chase but he survives unhurt. Meanwhile the only participant in the ambush that Buford recognized from police photos turns up with a bullet in his head. Witter brings in a beautiful woman named Marganne Stilson (Angel Tompkins) to win Buford's confidence and eventually kill him. ""Take a week"" he tells Stilson. ""Take two weeks. Just don't press to hard or he'll be on to you. This man is no dummy.""An investigation reveals that the only blue and white Camaro in the county is owned by Stud Pardee. Buford gets a warrant tracks down Pardee and proceeds to destroy his prized car while looking for contrabands. After tearing apart the door panels having Obra cut open his tires which costs $300 a piece and knocking out all the windows Buford finds a pint of whiskey under Pardee's seat. Buford offers Pardee a drink. Pardees declines. Buford tells him ""You look like you could use a drink."" Pardee takes the bottle and tries to drink it all down. Buford stops him telling him ""I need the rest of this for evidence."" Pardee tells Buford ""You know you have a hell of a lot of enemies around here."" Buford informs Pardee that his car is impounded and will be sold at an auction.Next Buford busts up a still operation that uses the Falcon Baptist Church as a cover. One of the moonshiners takes off running when accosted by Buford and his squad. Buford chases the man through the woods eventually catching him. The man asks Buford why he is has time to bother ""us poor blacks"" Buford tells him ""Same as everyone else."" To which the man replies ""Same as that big horse ranch on the hill?"" He says Buford looks the other way because A.C. Hand (Archie Grinalds) is a friend of his father's. Buford tells Obra to swear out a warrant for A. C. Hand because ""I don't want there to be any misunderstanding from anyone."" Buford raids Hand's place and tells him he's going to be facing time in the penitentiary. Buford's father (Noah Beery Jr.) is understandably upset. A.C. Hand is his oldest and dearest friend ""since before I ever even went to school."" Buford reminds his father that he is after the man at the top because he ""destroyed my family.""While Obra is in the middle of telling Buford that his uncle spotted a ""new cooking operation down on the Hatchie River"" Marganne Stilson posing as a graduate student from Ole Miss tries to get Buford to show her around. Buford declines because he is in the middle of something important. Stilson says she will hold Buford to his promise to show her around at a later date. Witter himself makes advances at Stilson but she quickly informs him that he cannot afford her. Buford is informed that the fancy speed-boat has been spotted again coming into McNairy County. Buford sets up a ""sting"" operation but as he is leaving his house he discovers a bomb planted under his hood by Ray Henry. Buford radios Obra and Grady to tell that that he has a ""little mechanical problem."" He reminds them that it is ""the man in the boat that you are after."" Grady inadvertently trips an alarm wire while the deputies are moving in on the still and Pinky Dobson again escapes in his speed-boat.Buford had made a secret deal with a local car dealer named Floyd Tate to get a new undercover police car every four to six weeks. Tate calls one day to tell Buford his new car is ready. Buford lets Obra talk him into going to exchange the cars for him. Since it's his day off Obra explained it wouldn't cost the county anything. Buford is hesitant at first but Obra finally convinces him. Obra is driving 100 mph in Buford's car when he discovers the brakes are out and the steering has been tampered with. Obra dies in a head-on collision. At the funeral Buford tells Obra's parents that Obra died in his place because his car had been tampered with.Buford makes a deal with Sheriff Tanner (Red West) in Alcorn County Mississippi to finally nail Pardee. Buford offers to show Stilson around. They get in Buford's car. Stilson claims to have left a map with all the places she is interested in seeing in the cottage she has rented by the lake. Buford says no problem and offers to take her there. Two snipers are waiting for him in a boat. Stilson suggests a picnic. Buford says it may be a little chilly for a picnic. Buford and Stilson go inside her cottage where Buford informs her that there is no student registered at Ole Miss named Stilson. He makes her go back outside with him and frightens off the snipers before telling Stilson to let Dobson know that he is wise to their plans.The Sheriff Tanner pursues Pardee back across the state line. Buford takes up the chase. Pardee is driving his new Corvette convertible. Pardee manages to go around a road-block set up by the deputies but later crashes and his trapped in his overturned car. Buford gets Pardee to confess that it was Pinky Dobson who paid him. Buford helps free Pardee before his car explodes. Dobson once again flees in his boat when his still is raided. This time however they are ready for him. Mr. Pusser has supervised a blockade of logs strung across the river. Buford tells Dobson to surrender. Dobson ignores him and ultimately is up-ended when he hits the barricade.Ray Henry purchases a machine gun and 1000 rounds of ammo. Buford learns from an FBI agent that Ray Henry was Dobson's cell-mate for three-and-a-half years and that they were both seen in the vicinity the night Buford and his wife were ambushed. Dobson is in the hospital but escapes with the help of his girlfriend Ruby Ann (Brooke Mills). Buford and an FBI agent pursue Dobson and Ruby Ann in an off-road car chase. Buford shoots Dobson. Ruby Ann tells Buford where Ray Henry is and when Dobson tells her to shut up she says she is not afraid of Witter like Dobson and Ray Henry both are.Buford and his men go to the boarding-house where Ray Henry is living. Buford is wounded but kills Ray Henry. As he is getting into an ambulance Buford asks Grady if he remembers a man from Nashville shaking his hand right after he was elected sheriff. Grady asks ""What man?"" Buford answers ""A fat man named Witter - I almost forgot about him""... which sets the stage up for Walking Tall: The Final Chapter."

As the action begins a young street urchin (Charlie Korsmo) who calls himself ""Kid"" is seen eating out of a garbage can and hiding from the cops. The Kid witnesses an illegal poker game between five thugs at the 7th Street Garage. Suddenly a car bursts through the brick wall of the building and guns down all the card players. The massacre is executed by Flattop (William Forsythe) one of Alphonse Big Boy Caprice's gun-happy hoods. Flattop leaves a calling card: he shoots a message into the brick wall with his tommy gun that reads ""Eat Lead Tracy."" Big Boy (Al Pacino) is expanding his crime syndicate by taking over new territory and exterminating anyone who stands in his way.Dick Tracy (Warren Beatty) and his girlfriend Tess Trueheart (Glenne Headly) are at an opera performance when his wrist radio alerts him of the killings. He excuses himself and quickly heads for the 7th Street Garage. When Tracy in his yellow overcoat and matching hat arrives at the crime scene he surmises immediately that Big Boy is responsible. Tracy returns to the opera and Tess. After the performance he answers questions from various news reporters.The camera shows a cartoon-influenced-view of the city and zooms in to the Club Ritz as a female singer Breathless Mahoney (Madonna) croons ""Sooner or Later (I Always Get My Man)."" Inside the club Breathless continues her performance accompanied on the piano by 88 Keys (Mandy Patinkin). As the club's owner Lips Manlis (Paul Sorvino) slurps down a plate of oysters one of his hoods reports that several of his men were bumped off and the others are getting very nervous. When Breathless joins Lips at his table after her performance he compliments her singing but she seems oblivious. (She's obviously his woman but isn't thrilled with the arrangement). Soon the police arrive to arrest Lips for operating a gambling establishment; they also arrest Breathless. However it is soon revealed that these are not real cops; they are Caprice's men.As Tracy and Tess walk down the street Tess tries to convince her detective boyfriend to settle down to a less dangerous job maybe a desk job. Of course Tracy isn't interested in playing it safe.As they enter a diner they are almost knocked down by the Kid as he flees the scene of his theft of a watch. Tracy chases after the kid but seemingly loses him. The Kid takes the watch to a shantytown where he presents it to his ruthless guardian. Just after the man hits the boy Tracy intervenes.The scene changes to Big Boy's hideout where he demands that Lips sign over the Club Ritz to him.

After the cops take Big Boy away Tracy stays behind. He follows Breathless into her dressing room and asks her to testify against Caprice. Breathless attempts to seduce Tracy and he comes close to giving in to her feminine charms. She says ""You don't know whether you want to hit me or kiss me. I get a lot of that."" When Tracy rejects her advances she refuses to testify against Big Boy. Since she is the only witness there isn't enough evidence against Caprice so he is released.When Tracy returns to his apartment early the next morning Tess is asleep in the living room while the Kid is sleeping in Tracy's bed. Tess seems very uncomfortable to be in a man's apartment so she hurries back to her greenhouse. She claims she is expecting a shipment of delphiniums.Tracy and Tess get the Kid new clothes and feed him all day. When they return to Tess's apartment there is an attempted hit on Tracy but it is unsuccessful.Miss Mahoney shows up at Tracy's office. (Apparently Tracy had telephoned her.) She is weainng a sexy dress. She says ""Thanks for calling. I was wondering what a girl had to do to get arrested.""  Tracy responds ""Wearing that dress is a step in the right direction."" Breathless agrees to testify against Big Boy but only if Tracy gives in to her sexual advances. Even though he is obviously attracted to her Tracy resists.At the Club Ritz Big Boy brings together several local crime bosses including Spud Spaldoni (James Caan) Pruneface (R.G. Armstrong) Ribs Mocca (Robert Beecher) Mumbles Itchy (Ed O'Ross) and Numbers (James Tolkan). Tracy has secretly followed Breathless there and informs Pat and Sam.

When he gets into his car it explodes.Itchy and Flattop grab Tracy and bring him to a boiler room where Big Boy is waiting. The Kid has stowed away on the car's back bumper. Big Boy offers Tracy a bribe. When Tracy refuses to cooperate Big Boy instructs his hoods to kill him but make it seem like an accident. They cause the boiler to overheat. Just before it explodes the Kid climbs through a small window and cuts Tracy loose.The Police Chief (Charles Durning) presents the Kid with an Honorary Detective Certificate with a badge for action in the face of grave danger. However it is only a temporary certificate because the Kid needs to choose a real name. During the ceremony the Kid presents Tracy with a policeman's badge he had found in the trash; it belonged to D.A. Fletcher (Dick Van Dyke).In a graveyard Big Boy tells the D.A. in no uncertain terms that he owns him. Later the D.A. tells Tracy that he has fourteen witnesses that will testify that Big Boy was at dance lessons at the time of Lips Manlis's killing.Breathless shows up at Tracy's apartment. Dressed in another slinky outfit she asks ""Aren't you going to frisk me?"" She's worried that if she testifies Big Boy will kill her.

When Miss Mahoney leaves Tess cries in the kitchen.A person with no face The Blank offers 88 Keys $5000 to give a letter to Big Boy that guarantees him protection for ten percent of his business. 88 Keys unsuccessfully tries to convince Big Boy that he has nothing to lose and should accept the offer.While Breathless sings a reprise of ""Sooner or Later (I Always Get My Man)"" Tracy leads a seemingly unsuccessful raid on Club Ritz but it is only a cover. During the raid one of Tracy's men plants a listening device in a back room of the club so Bug Bailey (Michael J. Pollard) can listen in on Big Boy's plans. As Breathless's song continues a montage shows the police foiling numerous crimes due to information gathered from the bug. When Big Boy discovers the listening device he uses it to lure Tracy. Tracy meets Tess at the diner where she tells him she is leaving town. During their meeting Tracy gets a call that something big is going down at the Southside Warehouse. Of course Tracy leaves Tess and rushes to the warehouse. Caprice has captured Bug Bailey and is bathing him in cement just like he did Lips. Tracy manages to save Bug. Just as Pruneface is about to kill Tracy The Blank steps out of the shadows and shoots Pruneface. Big Boy now agrees to the proposal that 88 Keys had offered but only if it includes killing Tracy.Heartbroken Tess goes to her mother's house. While there she has a change of heart and plans to return to Tracy but before she can tell him The Blank kidnaps her. Alone at the club 88 Keys and Breathless sing ""What Can You Lose?"" a rueful song about unrequited love. 88 Keys is obviously in love with Breathless but she has fallen for Tracy.Tracy and Breathless meet again at the docks and once again he asks her to testify. She demands that he admit he wants her. He finally admits that he thinks about her but he won't say he wants her because it would hurt the one he loves.After receiving a phone call from The Blank 88 Keys has a guy forge a letter from Tracy to the corrupt D.A. to meet him at a hotel with $10000 because he has the goods on him. Then Tracy receives a message to come to Tess' greenhouse but when he arrives The Blank drugs him with hidden gas lines and he collapses. Then The Blank in Tracy's yellow coat and matching hat runs into the hotel and up the stairs to a room. He shoots the D.A. with a silenced gun then 88 keys moves Tracy's drugged body into the room to frame him for the D.A.'s murder. 88 Keys screams threats that are overheard by the hotel manager who telephones the police. Hotel residents and the manager then hear gunshots. Before The Blank exits by the window he wakes Tracy with some ammonia. Tracy is arrested for blackmail and murder.Meanwhile a lady from the orphanage comes to take the Kid. During a few scenes of him at the orphanage he is miserable.Big Boy is back in business and thrilled. Against a montage of various gambling scenes and Big Boy raking in the dough we hear ""Back in Business"" (performed by a girls' trio: Janis Siegel Cheryl Bentyne and Lorraine Feather).From the orphanage the Kid calls the Chief and tells him he knows Tracy didn't kill the D.A. The Chief picks the Kid up from the orphanage on New Year's Eve to visit Tracy in jail. The Kid tells Tracy he now has a permanent certificate because he has chosen a name: Dick Tracy Jr.Sprung from jail by his colleagues on New Years Eve Tracy sets out to rescue his girlfriend. The Blank calls the police and frames Big Boy for kidnapping Tess. Tracy gets Mumbles to tell him who set him up for the D.A.'s murder. Mumbles clearly states without mumbling that Big Boy paid 88 Keys to get Tracy out of the way. At a shootout outside the Club Ritz the police and Tracy gun down most of Big Boy's men.Big Boy finds Tess in a vault. He takes her hostage and ties her to a drawbridge mechanism when he finds the drawbridge is up and can't escape. With some help from Breathless Tracy trails Big Boy and Tess and confronts Caprice in the gear room of the bridge. After they fight as Tracy is untying Tess The Blank fires a warning shot at Big Boy. The Blank tells Tracy to pick up a pipe and kill Big Boy but he doesn't. The Blank prepares to shoot Tracy but the Kid tackles him. Caprice shoots The Blank. Tracy then socks Big Boy which sends him falling to his death in the bridge's gears. Tracy rescues Tess. Beneath The Blank's mask Tracy is shocked to find Breathless Mahoney. She tells him that he was her only mistake and wonders if anything could have happened between them. She kisses him just before she dies. When Tracy finds Tess waiting outside they embrace.Later at the diner Tracy Tess and the Kid share a meal. Tracy gives the Kid a wrist radio. Then he stumbles through a marriage proposal to Tess but Pat interrupts on his wrist radio about a robbery in progress. As Tracy and the Kid leave to investigate Tracy tosses Tess a ring and says ""You're one in a million.""Madonna sings a reprise of ""More"" during the closing credits."

"In a mystical land a handsome youth named Ilias (Andrea Occhipinti) embarks on a quest leaving behind his paradise home for a fog-shrouded wilderness. From the God Cronos he receives a magic bow to mark his passage into manhood. He enters a strange land where small tribes are terrorized by werewolf-like creatures acting under orders of Ocron (Sabrina Siani) a nudeable masked female of great evil. While in a drugged state Ocron sees a faceless youth with a magic bow who dares to attack her. Ocron sends her werewolf servants out to look for the youth.A little later a gang of Ocron's marauders try to steal the bow and capture Ilias. But they are foiled when a rugged man dressed in animal skins leaps to his rescue beating up the marauders and forcing them to flee. The man introduces himself as Mace (Jorge Rivero) a nomadic outlaw. After admiring the younger man's magic bow Mace teams up with him on his quest to rid the land of evil. He affects a dismissal of human affairs but the soon the two are fast friends. Mace reveals that he has concept for people but cares for animals and has a bond with many species.Ocron sends Fado the leader of her brutal werewolves to capture Ilias and the magic bow. Ilias and Mace stop for the night to rest and eat with a small tribe that live in caves and offering the people a fresh animal kill as a gift. Ilias recognizes a young girl of the tribe seen earlier in the journey and the two of them go off together. Suddenly masked attackers kill the girl and abduct Ilias stealing his bow. Mace tracks them down to a camp and in a long and bloody fight rescues his young friend.Back at Ocron's lair Fado is burned on a giant hot-plate as punishiment for his failure to capture the magic bow. Enraged Ocron summons the Great Zora (Conrado San Martin) a spirit who resides in the body of a white wolf. She offers herself body and soul to Zora if he can kill the youth Ilias.Having found out the identity of the person responsible for all this Ilias declares that he will punish Ocron for her evil crimes over the land and exhorts Mace to join him. Mace refuses saying that he and Ocron stay clear of each other for she is too powerful to combat. Mace agrees to escort Ilias as far as the seashore from where he must sail to Ocrons fortress. On the way the two of them are assailed by hundreds of tiny arrows that fly from nowhere. Ilias is hit in the arm and soon breaks out in hideous boils. Mace sails with him along the coast to a place where a special plant grows that will cure his affliction from the poisoned arrow. Leaving his friend on the boat Mace jumps ashore and soon does battle with grotesque zombies and afterwards does battle with a double of himself. Mace wins the fight and his double is revealed as Zora who dissapearnce after reverting to his humanoid form.The special plant works and Ilias is restored to health. But Ilias has become disenchanted and decides to sail for home pleading with Mace go with him. Mace refuses and also refuses to take ownership of the magic bow. No sooner they have parted when Mace is attacked by a band of strange cobweb-covered creatures. They tie him to a wooden cross and interrogate him about the whereabouts of Ilias. Mace refuses to cooperate. Ilias appears and saves Mace from the creatures with his magic bow and arrows. But the captive Mace falls off a cliff and into the sea during the rescue. Super-intelligent dolphins bite at the ropes that tie Mace to the cross and he is washed ashore barely conscious. Ilias arrives and tells Mace that he has had a change of heart and decided to return to be with his friend and defeat Orcon.That night Ilias is grabbed and sucked down into a lair inhabited by subterarian monsters. When Mace follows he is forced to battle a few of them while chasing after Ilias. Venturing further into the caves Mace finds Ilias hanging upside down with his head cut off. Zora delivers the severed head of Ilias to Ocron as well as the magic bow. Mace lights a funeral pyre and sits beside his friends burning body. Ilias speaks to him inside his mind and tells him to anoint himself with the ashes. This will pass the power Cronos gave to Ilias and the magic bow will be Maces.The next morning Mace confronts Ocron in her lair and the bow suddenly flies out of her hands and into his. He takes on all of Ocron's surviving werewolves shooting them with his magical arrows from the bow. Mace fires a magic arrow at Ocron which penetrates her mask revealing the hideously ugly face of a ghoul atop her smooth nudeable body. As Ocron dies she transforms into a wolf and runs off into the wilderness with the white wolf Zora. The final scene has Mace alone once again walking into the wilderness to continue Ilias's quest to rid the land of evil.

"The year is 2210. Humans have moved out into space. In doing so they have
encountered several alien races -- like the Leatherfaces and the Vorhees -- all
of them vampiric. In order to make space safe for humans V-San (Vampire
Sanitation) crews serve as advance teams sweeping planets of vampires and
making them habitable for humans. The V-San crew of the Heironymous is
captained by Nicholas Churchill [Joe Lando] who loves his job as vampire hunter. First
officer is Damian Underwood [Dominic Zamprogna] new to the job after being hand-picked by
Churchill after Damian was blacklisted by Star Fleet for leading a mission that
got his entire crew killed. Damian would rather do almost anything but V-San
work but Churchill isn't about to sign for Damian's transfer not when he can
get a cheap but top-notch Star Fleet educated commander who needs just a bit of
training (and stomach) in vampire killing. Rosa Wong [Leanne Adachi] and Roman Kuchinsky [Aaron Pearl] form the rest of the human crew. Then there is Quintana [Natassia Malthe] -- beautiful telepathic
and born a vampire-human of two humans who were vampirized. Quintana has chosen
to side with humans in the intergalactic war against vampires but that doesn't
stop Rosa and Roman from questioning her loyalty and making snide remarks to
her face.After cleaning up the mess following a Vorhee [flesh- and organ-eating
vampires that must be staked to be destroyed] attack on Earth Base Quantum in
the Takai System the Heironymous receives a distress call from a scared
soil-sample technician on Basra 14 a remote mining colony. Fiona Kennedy [A.J. Cook] is
the sole survivor of an attack by Leatherfaces [primitive vampires who wear
facemasks made of their victims' skin but who can be killed with bullets]. His
stomach still churning from his first experience hunting vampires Damian
follows the captain into the mining shafts where they are trapped and the
captain is captured and killed. Suddenly Damian is catapulted to the position
of Captain pro tem of the Heironymous V-San crew but Rosa and Roman make it
clear they aren't going to take orders from Damian. They feel the captain's
death was Damian's fault for not doing enough to save him from the Leatherfaces.With no further assignments in the roster the Heironymous puts down at
Transit Station DHF in the Millerton Quadrant to drop off Fiona and allow the
crew a little R&R while awaiting orders. After an evening at the clubs Damian
tries to get his crew back to the ship only to find that Rosa and Roman are
refusing to reboard. Instead they have put in for a transfer and intend to go
clubbing in the interim but their retinal scans and IDs suddenly won't work.
They have been classified as V-San persona non grata and now have nowhere to go
but back to the ship where Damian offers them a deal. One more assignment
together and he'll sign for their transfers. Until then all protocols must be
followed under his command and the bickering between Rosa Roman and Quintana
must stop. After more bickering they agree.Suddenly an urgent SOS comes in from the Transit Station. They are under
attack. By the time the Heironymous returns everyone is dead. After a
preliminary investigation of the dead bodies Quintana admits that she doesn't
recognize the vampire species but can tell that they kill by injecting a venom
that causes immediate necrotization of the tissues; it is on the dead rotting
warm flesh that these vampires feed. The hunters go in search of the vampire
and find him feeding; they shoot him but horror upon horror a number of
leech-like vampire worms crawl out of his mouth. Quintana now recognizes Vermis
nosferati a species of wormlike vampires that lives inside the body of a host
and comes out only to feed. After the crew stabs and shoots all the vampires
until the last one emerges from a hole in the vampire's stomach (think
""Alien"") Quintana tries to talk to it. It will say nothing but rant about the
arrogance of humans. Remembering how vampires killed his entire family when he
was a child Roman shoots it which starts another big row between Quintana
Rosa and Roman.Meanwhile watching from closed circuit cameras Fiona and her friends
Gilles [Michael DeLuise] and Vondi [Peter DeLuise] criticize the arrogance of their human species and
applaud the work their group has accomplishedin their efforts to put
a monkeywrench in ""unbridled Earth imperialism."" Convinced that the Earth's
declaration of Manifest Destiny is a plague on the galaxy they have been
plotting with Muco [Michael Ironside] leader of the Vorhees to stop the intergalactic expansion
of humans and end prejudice against vampires.Back on the Heironymous Damian is attempting to fit the pieces together.
One thing he noticed in both the last two attacks is that although the vampire
species involved were different the electronic defense systems of both
stations had been shut down. He also noticed that Fiona's body was not amongst
the dead found on the Transit Station and wonders if she might be the key.
Fiona goes to a station he reasons and dismantles the electronic defense
system. When the vampires come in Fiona gets out and moves on to her next
target. Reasoning further that Fiona must have left the Transit Station just
before they returned Damian calls up the record of her departing flight plan
and learns that it leads to Cosmosis. Just then they get a call from HQ
directing them on a search and destroy mission in the Knobe System but Damian
and the crew decide that taking a little detour to Cosmosis is necessary to
revenge Captain Churchill's death even if it means they'll all be fired. The
crew doesn't know that Damian made up the assignment from HQ but it served the
purpose of uniting the crew.While the crew catches some zzzz's the Heironymous follows Fiona's ship
which leads them instead to Dhiagalev 8 a depleted ore planet. Just after
they land they are attacked by a small craft that Roman manages to shoot out
of the sky. Unfortunately it lands on the Heironymous and blows it up.
Stranded they decide to head for the old colony looking for a way off the
planet. They find the colony and they also find Fiona and vampires. Fiona
promises that no one will get hurt if Damian goes with her. She leads him to
Muco and Captain Churchill who has been turned into a vampire. Churchill
explains how the vampires want to learn from humans --things like compassion
and cooperation -- so that they can unite and take over the world. Damian
refuses to teach them so Muco orders Damian and his crew killed. Fiona
realizing that Muco has lied to her challenges Muco to show the other vampires
what he is capable of so Muco capably fires a bullet into her stomach.While Churchill and Damian duke it out Gilles and Vondi after seeing the
ease with which Muco killed Fiona convince the vampires holding the
Heironymous crew that Muco has ordered them released. Gilles and Vondi grab
weapons and escort Rosa Roman and Quintana to the room where Churchill
has almost bested Damian. As they enter Gilles and Vondi toss the weapons back
to the crew and they open fire on the vampires. Damian stabs Churchill in the
heart with a shard of glass then sneaks up on Muco and stabs him.
Their work done here Damian and crew head back to HQ to get a new ship.

The film opens with three men Ron Mark and Peter abandoning their boat in the middle of the ocean and happening upon an uncharted island. After being captured by a gang of masked madmen the three awaken to find themselves tied to crucifixes in the middle of a large militia camp. The trio are then introduced to the leader of the militia Karl(better known to his men as the Meister). Karl and his hideously deformed father Karl Sr. oversee a series of gruesome executions before threatening the three trespassers with the death penalty. After spitting in Karl's face Peter is put to death by having his right hand amputated with a machete and spears driven through his torso. The two remaining seamen as well as a traitor named Leon are turned loose in the forest to be hunted down by Karl's army of trained killers. After telling Ron and Mark of the Meister's horrific experiments the three begin a search for weapons. Meanwhile Karl's hired surgeon Dr. Senius is working on a breed of super soldiers that are going to replace the fallen ones in battle. After being disgusted with Senius's overall progress Karl threatens Senius with death if he doesn't have the first batch ready within 24 hours. The next day Leon tells the men of a safety bunker located on the far end of the island. Using handmade spears the three kill two guards and severely injure one before taking off with their weapons. The surviving guard is punished for his disobedience by Karl when his spinal cord is torn from his anus with a large meat hook. Senius's first batch of super soldiers are turned loose in the woods. After a run in with the super soldiers(who better resemble zombies perhaps because of their hasty creation). Ron and Mark part with Leon who acquires the help of two comrades named Son and Giang. After quickly dispatching the soldiers the three look for Ron and Mark. Ron and Mark meet their ends at a small pond when they are ambushed by a group of infantrymen. After their bodies arrive back at the base in poor condition(Ron's body split in half at the waist and the upper left corner of his head missing and Mark's head split in half down the middle)Senius orders that the soldiers responsible be punished right away. Karl lines them up and shoots them in the head one by one with a sawed-off double barrel shotgun. When it comes time to kill the last one he runs prompting Karl to shoot him in the leg. Karl then drowns him in a nearby puddle while Senius listens in and masturbates. Then Karl deploys a heavily trained gang of ninja assasins called the Black Demons to hunt down the remaining traitors and kill them. After briefly confronting the ninjas and killing them Son Giang and Leon plan a full-scale attack on the camp at sundown. After reaching the main gates disguised as Black Demons with a prisoner the two guards on patrol demand to know why Leon's still alive. Son and Giang then kill them both and advance on the camp. After slitting a soldiers throat Leon steals his rocket launcher and oversees the fight from on top of a hill and assists the two others in killing off the soldiers. After running low on ammo Leon joins Son and Giang on the ground below. Leon confronts a soldier wielding a machete and ends up getting impaled. With what energy he has left Leon takes his killer's revolver and shoots him. After killing him Leon drops dead. Son hides outside of Senius's tent and slices off his nose with a katana. Senius stumbles back into his tent where an unfinished super soldier asphyxiates him in his open torso and subsequently tears off his head. Senius is finished off when he runs outside headless and is shot by Giang with a submachine gun. Both Son and Giang find Leon's body and in an act of vengeance hunt down Karl Sr. and Karl. When they are found trying to escape the two Karls are confronted by Son and Giang who kill their remaining troops. Son and Giang then engage in hand-to-hand combat with Karl Sr. and his son. After Son gets the best of him Karl Sr. calls upon his bodyguard a hockey-masked commando with a mechanical arm. After a short scuffle Son detaches the bodyguard's artificial arm and impales him with it. Giang and Karl continue to fight until Giang back flips over him and rams his fist through his body from behind and places a hand grenade in his mouth. Karl's head explodes and he drops a rocket launcher. With the rocket launcher Giang tells Son to get out of the way. After Son dives for cover Giang proceeds to shoot Karl Sr. with the rocket launcher exploding him. The two exchange a high five before the credits roll.

The image transforms into a time clock and a group of security guards clock out and leave for the night.Outside a figure in black on a matching motorcycle comes flying through the air. She leaps from the bike makes a backward flip in mid-air and the bike lands with a crash on the guardhouse causing a major explosion. The figure lands elegantly in front of the explosion. As she removes her helmet we see it is Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss). The guards in the parking lot attack her but she easily fights them off. The picture crumbles into coding like dust and when restored we're very high up on the side of a building. Trinity bursts through the window guns in hand. She turns on her back in mid-air an agent is pursuing her and jumps after head first. They exchange gunfire falling to the streets below in slow motion. Eventually Trinity is shot in the chest. Something (impossible to see who or what) crashes into a car by the sidewalk. Neo (Keanu Reeves) wakes up. He looks over at Trinity lying in his arms sleeping peacefully then gets out of bed.We see the Nebuchadnezzar from outside as it hovers through the sewers and lands. Inside are Link (Harold Perrineau) and Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) in the cockpit. ""Sir Are you sure about this?"" Link asks. Morpheus tells him that if he is to continue as operator on his ship Link must trust him. ""Yes sir. I will sir"" says Link. Morpheus glances at him. ""I mean I do sir.""In the mess hall sits Neo pondering. Trinity sits down opposite him. ""Still can't sleep?"" she asks. Neo shakes his head and takes a sip from his breakfast. ""You wanna talk?"" Trinity offers. ""They're just dreams"" Neo reassures. ""If you're afraid of something..."" ""I just wish... I wish I knew what I'm supposed to do that's all. I just wish I knew."" ""She's gonna call don't worry"" assures Trinity. Link pops his head in and Trinity asks ""Are we ready to go?"" ""We're already late"" he replies.In a dark room underground Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith) is addressing a crowd of other ship crews about the imminent threat to Zion. The machines are digging and will reach Zion in 72 hours. Naturally Morpheus and crew arrive fashionably late making sure to draw attention by making an argument right away that there is nothing to fear for he believes the prophecy will come true very soon and end the war. ""But first the Oracle must be consulted."" Accordingly Morpheus asks for a volunteer ship to remain in broadcast depth while the Nebuchadnezzar returns to Zion to recharge and make repairs despite Commander Lock's direct orders for ALL ships to return. Captain Ballard (Roy Jones Jr.) of the Caduceus volunteers ""just to see what Lock does to you."" He gives Morpheus 36 hours.Meanwhile someone knocks on the entrance door. The corrupt (Paul Cotter) opens a small hatch on the door and a head in silhouette is seen against the headlights of a car. The stranger asks for Neo. The guard claims not to know who he's talking about and the stranger hands him an envelope telling him to give it to Neo. ""You see he set me free."" It's beyond doubt the voice of Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving).Neo having sensed something comes up asking what's going on. ""How did you know someone was here?"" one of the guards asks. ""He wanted me to give you this"" and hands Neo the envelope. Into Neo's palm drops an earpiece worn by agents. ""Agents are coming"" warns Neo. They flee leaving Neo to handle the threat.The three agents recognize Neo as ""the anomaly"" but proceed anyway on the basis that he is after all ""only human."" Neo pauses momentarily while blocking a blow ""Hm. Upgrades."" He fights them off with ease. When the battle is over Neo crouches down the ground ripples and he shoots to the skies (as he did in the very end of the prequel). At the scene of the battle Smith walks up and states that it all ""went as expected"". Facing him is another Smith ""Yes."" ""It's all happening exactly as before..."" ""Well not exactly..."" They smile.Morpheus and Trinity are driving to an exit as Morpheus calls Link and asks what happened. Link says a bunch of agents showed up and that suddenly the ""coding got all weird."" He has never seen anything like it. Morpheus then asks where Neo is now. ""He's doing his Superman-thing.""Like Link said Neo is soaring through the clouds. Then he stops and heads back down to the ground. He lands in an old building and enters an abandoned apartment which we recognize as that of the Oracle. ""Where are you?"" he whispers.The Nebuchadnezzar approaches Zion. Link communicates with one of the gate operators and they are let inside. Once landed The crew exits the ship and are met by Captain Mifune (Nathaniel Lees) and three A.P.U. escorts. ""Are you here to escort me to the stockades captain?"" asks Morpheus. ""I'm just here to keep the peace"" assures Mifune. Commander Lock wants to see Morpheus and accordingly the escorts take him to him. ""What's with them?"" Neo asks. ""Lock and Morpheus?"" asks Trinity back. Neo nods. ""Niobe."" ""Captain Niobe?"" ""Mhm. She used to be with Morpheus now she's with Lock."" ""What happened?"" ""Morpheus went to the Oracle after that everything changed."" ""Yeah she can do that."" Trinity Neo and Link start gathering their luggage when a teenage boy (Clayton Watson) comes running enthusiastically towards them. ""How does he always know?"" Trinity asks Neo in a hushed voice. ""Doesn't he have anything better to do?"" wonders Neo. ""You know what they say about the life you save..."" answers Trinity. ""I didn't save his life"" Neo claims. The kid now right in front of them welcomes them home and offers to carry their bags. Both Neo and Trinity decline. ""You can carry these..."" says Link. ""Sure Link.""As they all walk towards the elevators the kid starts going on about how he will be old enough to join a crew next year and that he wants to serve aboard the Nebuchadnezzar. His main reason for this is that Neo saved him. ""You saved yourself"" assures Neo.Meanwhile Lock (Harry Lennix) tells Morpheus off for asking a ship to stay behind when they all had been ordered back to Zion. Morpheus defends himself with his belief that they must have the Oracles advice and that Neo will be the key to ending the war. Lock on the other hand has no confidence in the prophecy and is only concerned with having all the firepower available for when the machines reaches Zion.The kid mentions a gathering that evening a bigger one than anyone can remember. It is a popular belief that something big will happen.Councillor Hamann (Anthony Zerbe) enters in the middle of the discussion. He asks their opinion on what is to be said about the situation to the people at the gathering that evening. Lock believes they should know as little as possible they wouldn't want to start a panic. Morpheus thinks the truth should be told and that there will be no panic because there is nothing to fear.They enter the elevator and after a few seconds of silence Link gets off telling the kid to come with him. ""These two have other things to do."" As soon as the elevator doors closes Neo and Trinity drop their bags and make out passionately. ""Are you thinking what I'm thinking?"" asks Neo. ""I'm thinking this elevator is too damn slow"" replies Trinity. But before long they are interrupted by the elevator doors opening and are received by a crowd of people. They carry offerings asking Neo to look over their sick children etc. Neo thanks them for their gifts and says he'll try. Trinity lowers her head in disappointment and starts to walk away. Neo asks her not to go but Trinity answers ""It's okay. They need you."" ""I need you"" he pleads. ""I know there's time"" she assures him and walks away.Meanwhile Link arrives at his apartment where his girlfriend Zee (Nona Gaye) is waiting with her sister-in-law Cas (Gina Torres) her niece (Alima Ashton-Sheibu) and nephew (Joshua Mbakwe). ""Uncle Link!"" the little ones exclaim as he walks through the door. After welcoming him home Cas and her kids leave. Zee is not happy at all. Link serving on Morpheus' ship terrifies her. All other ships are home twice as often as the Nebucadnezzar. She has also already lost two brothers to that ship and is afraid she will lose him too. ""It's not fair"" she says. ""You think Cas thinks it's fair that I'm here and Dozer's not?"" Link argues. He also says nothing will happen to him Morpheus says it will all be over soon. The important thing is that he's home now and they hug.Evening comes and everyone is gathered in Zion's temple cavern. Counselor Hamann is standing on a cliff high above the masses as he gives the opening prayer and introduces Morpheus who then steps up and gives his speech. He confirms the rumors of the machines digging and convinces everyone that there is indeed nothing to be afraid of. ""We are still here!"" is his main argument and tonight they will make so much noise as to show the machines that they are not afraid. The music starts and everyone starts dancing as if it really was their last night on earth.As he leaves the podium Morpheus runs into Niobe and they flirt mildly before Lock call her to his side.Meanwhile Neo and Trinity meet up in the outskirts of the caves. ""I was thinking. Everyone's here..."" says Neo. ""Follow me."" answers Trinity. While everyone else parties like never before Neo and Trinity are alone at last and they make passionate love to each other and have the sex of their lives!However Neo suddenly gets a flash of his dream where Trinity is shot and falls into his fears of losing her. Trinity asks what is wrong but he only answers that he is afraid of losing her. She grasps his hand ""Do you feel this? I'm never letting go."" They hold each other tightly and remain silently in each others arms.Eventually everyone goes to bed and the lights are shut down.Back in the Matrix Bane (Ian Bliss) and another member of the Caduceus crew are fleeing for their lives from something. They have reached an exit and have a message from the Oracle. Bane goes last and just before he can get out Smith jumps through the skylight and plunges his hand into Bane's chest. ""Oh God"" shivers Bane in terror. ""Smith will suffice"" says the former agent satisfied. Black fluid of sorts spreads all over Bane's body from where Smith has his hand and once covered he is another Smith-clone. The clone then puts the phone to his ear and leaves the Matrix.Neo wakes up and goes outside his apartment gazing over the city. Councillor Hamann approaches him and offers his company. Neo accepts. Hamann asks if Neo has ever been to the engineering level. He has not so they go. Once down there Hamann tells Neo about his wondering if they the free humans aren't in a sense plugged into these machines. They do after all depend on them. Neo answers that they control these machines that if they wanted to they could shut them down destroy them. But Hamann points out there is the catch. If they did turn them off what would happen to their water supply heat etc.? But in the end he has no point to his musings and they leave it at that.It's morning and Ballard knocks on a door in Zion and Trinity opens. ""Is Neo here?"" Trinity opens the door further and Neo appears. It's a message from the Oracle. Against Lock's orders Morpheus takes off with ship and crew to have Neo meet with her.Before departure Zee tries to urge Link to wear her lucky necklace. He reluctantly agrees not believing in that stuff and they kiss.As the party go their ship Bane/Smith sits in nook of the tunnel cutting his hand with a knife. When the quartet pass him he sneaks up behind them knife in hand. He is discovered though when the kid from before comes running. ""Neo!"" Bane/Smith hides the knife behind his back and claims he just wanted to say good luck. The kid has to say goodbye to his hero too before he leaves and give him something from one of the orphans. ""He said you'd understand."" It's a metal spoon.Lock is outraged at Counselor Hamann for giving the Nebuchadnezzar clearance to leave. He did so because he believes their survival depends on more than how many ships they have.Neo enters the Matrix near the designated address which is in Chinatown. He enters a small room from the street and at the back of the room sits an Asian-looking man in corresponding clothes meditating. To Neo who sees everything in coding the stranger radiates a golden light. ""Welcome"" he says. ""I am Seraph."" He will take Neo to the Oracle. ""But first I must apologize."" ""For what?"" wonders Neo. ""For this"" says Seraph (Collin Chou) and attacks. After some kicking punching and blocking Seraph is satisfied. He had to make sure Neo really was the One as the Oracle has many enemies. ""You could have just asked"" claims Neo with a smile. ""You do not really know someone until you fight them"" answers Seraph. He then shuts the door to the street pulls out a key that he turns in the key hole and opens the door again. It no longer leads to the streets of Chinatown but to a white hallway lined with green doors. ""These are back doors"" Neo concludes. Seraph confirms. ""Where'd they go?"" Link wonders in the real world. They walk down the hall till Seraph stops and opens another door. This one leads to an isolated courtyard where the Oracle (Gloria Foster) sits waiting on a bench.Neo approaches her and she asks him to sit down. He politely declines. ""Suit yourself"" she says and shrugs. Neo sits down after all. ""I felt like sitting."" ""Of course.""""Let's get the obvious out of the way"" the Oracle starts. ""You're not human are you"" Neo says.
""Doesn't get more obvious than that."" ""If I had to guess I'd say you were a program of the machine world. And so is he"" Neo looks at Seraph. ""I guess the most obvious question is how can I trust you?"" The Oracle answers that he has to choose whether to trust her or not.
""Candy?"" she offers him.
""You already know if I'm going to take it?""
""Wouldn't be much of an oracle if I didn't.""
""Then how can I make a choice?""
The Oracle replies that he has already made the choice and only needs to understand it. ""But why are you here?"" wonders Neo.
The Oracle points out a flock of crows and explains that at some point a program to govern them as well as all other things. The programs that do their job are invisible as opposed those who do not. The latter manifest as what humans refer to as ghosts vampires etc.
""When a program faces deletion it can either choose to hide out here or return to the Source. Where you must go.""
""The machine mainframe.""
""You've seen haven't you? The The door of bright light.""
Neo confirms.
""What happens when you walk through it?!
""I see Trinity. Something bad happens and Trinity starts to fall.""
""Do you see her die?""
""No""
""You've got the sight now Neo.""
Neo wants to know why he can not see what happen to Trinity but the answer he gets is simply that we cannot see past the choices we do not understand.
""Are you saying I have to choose whether Trinity lives or dies?""
""No Neo. You've already made the choice.""
Neo refuses to accept this he can not do such a thing but he has to.
""Why?""
""Because you are the One.""
If Neo doesn't go to the Source all of Zion will perish and to get there he will need the Keymaker an exile program currently held captive by the Merovingian an old and dangerous program.Seraph comes over saying they must leave and so he and the Oracle leave through the back door. Just as the door closes Smith appears. Apparently Neo and he are connected somehow. He explains that when Neo destroyed him he was supposed to be deleted but he refused to obey the rules and has now become ""unplugged"". Then there is the question of purpose and Smith-clones start coming towards them each elaborating on the importance of purpose. When the ""original"" Smith and Neo are surrounded by clones Smith tries to turn him into another clone but with some effort Neo manages to resist and pulls Smith's hand out of his chest. All Smiths attack. A lengthy fight ensues more clones joining in continually. In the middle of it all an agent comes to the scene only to be turned into yet another clone but not before recognizing Smith in surprise. Eventually Neo abandons the fight and all the clones go their separate ways.Back in the real world Neo is unplugged.
""It was Smith"" says Morpheus.
Neo confirms and that he has found a way to copy himself.In Zion the council and all crews are gathered. Lock explains their current situation and tactics. The council have limited confidence in these tactics. They then ask if there has been word from the Nebucadnezzar. There has not. Hence the council asks for two volunteer ships to go search for them against Lock's protests. Captain Soren (Steve Bastoni) stands up immediately. No other reacts to the request. Bane/Smith suggests to Ballard that they should volunteer but Ballard just tells him to shut up. Eventually Niobe declares her willingness to search for the missing party to Lock's surprise and horror. He tries to forbid her to go but she is determined because some things never change and some things do.Neo Trinity and Morpheus arrive at a French restaurant in the Matrix where thy find the Merovingian (Lambert Wilson) and his wife Persephone (Monica Bellucci) at the head table as if they were king and queen. As a ""trafficker of information"" as he calls himself the Merovingian knows why they are there. The question is according to him do they know? He says they are there because they were told to declares he has no intention of letting go of the Keymaker and tells them to tell the Oracle from him that ""her time is almost up."" He also explains to them what he holds as the one truth namely the forces of causality. As he has said all he feels like sharing he cuts the negotiations short and excuses himself to the men's room. Neo Morpheus and Trinity are escorted to the elevator by the Merovingian's henchmen.When the elevator stops and the doors open they see Persephone waiting for them.
""If you want the Keymaker follow me"" she says dryly and takes them to the men's room (where the Merovingian is not).
""Why are you doing this?"" Neo asks. Her answer is that she has come to resent her husband. She will take them to the Keymaker on one condition: that Neo kiss her as if she were Trinity she wants to remember what love feels like. Trinity protests by pulling a gun at Persephone but as they need the Keymaker she has no choice but to back down and look on in anguish. As soon as Persephone is satisfied she fulfills her promise.She leads them through the kitchen of the restaurant and to a door at the other end. This she opens with a key similar to that of Seraph's. This takes them to the great hall of a chateau. Persephone further leads the party to a small study where two shady men are sitting guard. She shoots one with a silver bullet and tells the other to tell his master what she has done or die like his friend. ""He's in the lady's room"" Persephone shouts after the vampire as he scurries off and opens a secret door to the dungeons where they find the Keymaker (Randall Duk Kim).As they re-enter the main hall the Merovingian and his henchmen burst through the front door. He is shocked by his wife's actions and fail to understand her reasons. She plainly explains that it is just like he said: cause and effect. The Merovingian claims there is no cause for this but Persephone points out the lipstick he is still wearing (not on his lips...) and leaves.The Merovingian immediately order the Twins (Neil Rayment and Adrian Rayment) who turn out to have the ability to turn into spectrals to get the Keymaker back. The Keymaker flees right away and Trinity and Morpheus follow him leaving Neo to handle the henchmen. They put up more of a fight than the agents but are still not much of a match for the One. Disappointed the Merovingian and company leave the way they came closing the door behind them. This causes the connection between the restaurant and castle to break and when he re-opens the door Neo finds himself high up in the mountains. He therefore runs the way the Keymaker went.Meanwhile the Keymaker connects the door at the end of a hallway to a parking lot but Trinity fails to close the door before one of the Twins gets an arm between the door and the door frame. Thus the other twin can merely glide through in spectral form prompting Trinity to fight him (Morpheus holds the door) but she loses and the Twin pulls a knife to her throat. Morpheus has no choice but to let the other Twin through. In the meantime the Keymaker acquires a car and Trinity runs over and gets in the driver's seat while Morpheus holds the Twins at bay. Morpheus gets in the car and they flee. As they drive away one of the twins closes the door in Neo's face.Neo crashes through the door anyway but is again in the mountains. He calls Link who can only tell him he's in the mountains. Neo then inquires how Trinity and Morpheus are doing. They are in trouble Link tells him and gives him directions to their whereabouts.In the city Morpheus and Trinity are zooming through the streets trying to shake off the pursuing Twins who have acquired a car of their own. Morpheus calls Link for help and it turns out the only way is onto the freeway. By now a load of police cars are on their tail. ""You always told me to stay off the freeway"" says Trinity.
""Yes that's true.""
""You said it was suicide.""
""Then let us hope that I was wrong.""Elsewhere in the Matrix Niobe calls Link to tell him they have come to get them out. ""Just follow the sirens..."" says Link.On the freeway the Twins are now in front of Morpheus and co. and as soon as they run out of ammo the one not driving takes spectral form and lands himself in the backseat of the other car next to the Keymaker. Morpheus tries to fight him off to little avail. Then Agents show up; one lands on the hood of Trinity's and Morpheus's car and rips off the roof. Morpheus though held down by the Twin fires at him but this helps no more than it ever has before. Trinity hits the brakes so that the Agent is flung off. Morpheus continues to struggle with the Twin and eventually gets hold of a sword which he thrusts through his seat forcing the twin to let go of his solid self and get left behind. He is immediately picked up by his brother.
""We are getting aggravated.""
""Yes we are.""
Another Agent has caught up with our heroes and fires away as well hitting them with his car. They manage to lose him though by leaving the freeway in a way that causes the Agent to crash into the railing. They are now on a bridge over the freeway and come to a full stop.
""Trinity get him out of here"" orders Morpheus.
""Come on!"" she shouts to the Keymaker and they jump off the bridge onto a truck below carrying a load of motorcycles. Morpheus stays behind to handle the Twins. He does this by causing their crash and shooting the gas tank.Trinity and the Keymaker obtain a motorcycle and continue towards their exit. It is not long however before an Agent takes control of a semi-truck forcing Trinity to turn around. Police follow and are soon transformed into more Agents. Morpheus comes towards them on the roof of another semi-truck and grabs the Keymaker. Trinity is no longer being pursued and escapes as it is the Keymaker the Agents want this time. An Agent therefore attacks Morpheus instead and they battle on top of the semi. After a while Morpheus is thrown off but Niobe catches him on the hood of her car. The Agent approaches the Keymaker.
""You are no longer necessary.""
""We do only what we're meant to do"" says the Keymaker.
""Then you're meant for only one more thing. Deletion."" replies the Agent .
Just as the Agent is about to terminate the Exile Mopheus jumps on him throwing him off. This only prompts the Agent to relocate to the driver's seat of the same semi-truck and forces Niobe to leave. Further back another Agent is in control of another semi-truck and turns the truck aiming for the other truck and a head-on collision.
""Neo if you're out there I could use some help"" prays Mopheus to himself.
""What is that?"" wonders Link about something on the screen.
Neo comes flying through the air grabbing Morpheus and the Keymaker in the nick of time.In Zion they learn that the machines drilling through the earth are currently being slowed down by iron which means they will be in Zion in little over nine hours.Soren Niobe Morpheus and their crews are gathered with the Keymaker. He tells them what they must do. Neo must go through the door that leads to the source but to keep the entire building from exploding the electrical network providing energy to 27 square blocks must be disabled. Niobe and Ghost (Anthony Brandon Wong) must therefore take out a power station while Soren and his crew deactivate the emergency network. This will give a five-minute window during which Neo must open the door. ""All must be done as one. If one fails all fail"" the Keymaker instructs.Back in the real world while waiting for it to be time for him to go Neo makes Trinity promise not to enter the Matrix. She agrees.Niobe and Ghost succeed but Soren and his crew are killed by Sentinels just before they accomplish their mission. Link and Trinity discover that they aren't moving and so Trinity has to go in to finish their job.As Neo sees the lights go out he Morpheus and the Keymaker enter the hall of back door where they are met by Smith.Trinity enters the Matrix and all happens as in Neo's dreams.In the hallway Neo and Morpheus are assaulted by a horde of Smiths. They try to take Morpheus' body for their own but Neo prevents it. In the heat of the battle the Keymaker sneaks around by using alternate doors and opens the one they seek just as the power grid fails again thanks to Trinity. Neo grabs Morpheus and flies through the door. Unfortunately the Keymaker is gunned down by Smiths as he closes it again and dies. Before taking his last ""breath"" he tells Morpheus which door to take to get home and gives Neo the key he needs to open the special door. Simultaneously an Agent is heading for Trinity without her knowledge. Neo enters the door of light.He is now in a room where the walls are made up of old-fashioned television screens. In a chair on the other side of the room sits the Architect (Helmut Bakaitis) the one who designed the Matrix. Neo asks why is he there. The Architect explains that Neo is an anomaly he has been unable to remove. ""You haven't answered my question"" Neo points out. The Architect confirms and mentions that he caught on faster than the others... The screens showing Neo and expressing his thoughts all express bewilderment by what the Architect means. ""The Matrix is older than you know"" the Architect explains. Apparently this is the sixth version. Neo has trouble accepting but concludes that ""either no one told me or no one knows.""
""Precisely."" The anomaly is essential to the equations the Architect builds the Matrix from.
""Choice the problem is choice"" Neo realizes.Just then Trinity is surprised by an Agent. She is no match for him and soon hits the floor.The Architect describes the first Matrix which was perfect and therefore failed. The Architect tried again making it reflect the human nature but in vain. The problem was discovered by ""an intuitive program initially created to investigate certain aspects of the human psyche."" The Oracle discovered (according to the Architect by chance) that the humans had to be given choice. This leads them to Zion and Neo is with the Architect because it is about to be destroyed a fact Neo cannot accept.The Architect simply points out that it is for the sixth time and they are getting better and better at it.Trinity continues to battle the Agent but is slowly being defeated.The Architect explains that Neo must now return to the Source so that the ""prime program can be launched. Then he must choose 23 people to rebuild Zion. If he does not the Matrix will crash due to system failure killing everyone connected. As Zion is about to be destroyed that would mean the end of the human race. Neo points out however that machines need humans to survive.""There are levels of survival we are prepared to accept"" the Architect claims. He doubts however that Neo will accept the extinction of all humans. The Architect elaborates that the five predecessors were designed to develop an attachment to their fellow human beings. Neo on the other hand has a more specific aim for his affections.
""Trinity!"" Neo exclaims in a whisper. The screens are showing her predicament and the Architect reveals that she entered the Matrix to save his life. The Architect presents Neo with two doors. The one to his right leads to the Source and the one on the left to Trinity and the downfall of man. The old man can tell that Neo's feelings are blinding him from the ""fact"" that Trinity will die either way. As the Oracle predicted Neo goes to his left only stopping to threaten the Architect that he better hope they don't meet again.
""We won't"" is the only reply.Back in the real world Morpheus is just coming out of the Matrix.
""We have a problem sir"" says Link.
""Oh no"" exclaims Morpheus as he sees Trinity connected.Trinity is still battling the Agent and jumps through the window and falls the Agent close behind and he shoots her as predicted in Neo's nightmares. Neo flying faster than ever catches her just in time the agent hitting the car crushing it. Neo lands on a rooftop with her and lays her down. She appears fatally wounded. Neo removes the bullet by manipulating the code of the Matrix but Trinity's heart stops. Neo refused to accept her death. Reaching through the code of the Matrix he compresses her heart and restarts it. She awakens with a start and they kiss passionately.
""I guess this makes us even"" she whispers.Morpheus fails to understand why the prophecy has not come true. Neo tells him and the others that they have 24 hours to save Zion and that the prophecy was just another form of control a lie. Morpheus has major trouble accepting this but before they can contemplate this complexity their proximity alert sounds. The sentinels are just outside of EMP range. ""It's a bomb"" says Neo. They flee.Keeping its distance the sentinel they detected spins itself rapidly and releases a tow bomb that collides with the Neb. From a safe distance the crew see the Nebuchadnezzar blown apart by the powerful weapon.""I have dreamed a dream but now that dream has gone from me"" Morpheus says heartbroken.The Sentinels pursue them immediately and the humans run for their lives. Suddenly Neo stops.""Something's different"" he says""What?"" asks Trinity.""I can feel them.""As the Sentinels descend on them Neo stops them in mid-air as if he were emitting an EMP. As soon as all the Sentinels are down he collapses. Just then the ship Hammer comes to their rescue.Aboard Neo is lying unconscious in sickbay Trinity at his side. In the conference room the crew of the ship tell Morpheus and Link about the counterattack on the digging machines. It all sounded good but someone screwed up. An EMP triggered before they were in position and five ships were incapacitated. It was a slaughter. No one knows how it happened. The sole survivor now lies unconscious in the sickbay of the Hammer with Neo. It is Bane.Continued in ""The Matrix Revolutions (2003)."""
Following the events of The Matrix (1999) Neo and the rebel leaders estimate they have 72 hours until 250000 probes discover Zion and destroy it and its inhabitants. Neo must decide how he can save Trinity from a dark fate in his dreams.::Seifer <kypdurron@iname.com>
Six months after the events depicted in The Matrix Neo has proved to be a good omen for the free humans as more and more humans are being freed from the matrix and brought to Zion the one and only stronghold of the Resistance. Neo himself has discovered his superpowers including super speed ability to see the codes of the things inside the matrix and a certain degree of precognition. But a nasty piece of news hits the human resistance: 250000 machine sentinels are digging to Zion and would reach them in 72 hours. As Zion prepares for the ultimate war Neo Morpheus and Trinity are advised by the Oracle to find the Keymaker who would help them reach the Source. Meanwhile Neo's recurrent dreams depicting Trinity's death have got him worried and as if it was not enough Agent Smith has somehow escaped deletion has become more powerful than before and has chosen Neo as his next target.::Soumitra
In this second adventure Neo and the rebel leaders estimate that they have 72 hours until Zion falls under siege to the Machine Army. Only a matter of hours separates the last human enclave on Earth from 250000 Sentinels programmed to destroy mankind. But the citizens of Zion emboldened by Morpheus conviction that the One will fulfill the Oracles Prophecy and end the war with the Machines rest all manner of hope and expectation on Neo who finds himself stalled by disturbing visions as he searches for a course of action.::Anthony Pereyra {hypersonic91@yahoo.com}
Neo now possessing powers such as super speed the ability to fly and the ability to see the code embedded in the Matrix begins to find out about his role as the One. He starts experiencing nightmares about Trinity being killed. Meanwhile the rebels get information about 250000 sentinals reaching Zion in 72 hours. Neo seeks the help of the Oracle who advises him to seek the Keymaker who is being held captive by a powerful and dangerous program known as the Merovingian. As Neo learns about the history of the Matrix and what he must do to stop the war he is faced with the ultimate question - to save Trinity or to end the war.::srijanarora-152-448595
"Neo (Keanu Reeves) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) have been summoned by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) to join him on a voyage to Zion the last outpost of free human beings on Earth. Neo and Trinity's work together has been complicated by the fact the two are involved in a serious romantic relationship. Upon their arrival in Zion Morpheus locks horns with rival Commander Lock (Harry J. Lennix) and encounters his old flame Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith).

"A rebel force has taken over nuclear missile launch sites near Vladivostok in Eastern Russia. The leader of the force a radical Russian named Radchenko (Daniel von Bargen) threatens to launch the missiles he has seized. Radchenko's forces about 60000 strong have also gained control of three Akula-class attack submarines to protect the shores off Vladivostok.The United States summons the officers and crew of the nuclear submarine Alabama which is being dispatched to patrol the coast of eastern Russia. If necessary the Alabama will be available to launch nuclear missiles to stop Radchenko's forces before they can launch their hijacked missiles.Commander Ron Hunter (Denzel Washington) of the US Navy is called into an interview with the Alabama's CO Captain Ramsey (Gene Hackman). The Alabama's executive officer (XO) is ill and a replacement is needed. Ramsey is impressed with Hunter's service record and the two connect over horse riding. Ramsey's Jack Russell Terrier also seems to approve of Hunter.The situation in Vladivostok escalates and Hunter and his friend Lt. ""Weps"" Ince (Viggo Mortensen) are called up for duty and leave immediately for the Alabama. Ramsey gives a stirring send-off speech and the boat puts to sea. Before they submerge Ramsey and Hunter enjoy cigars.At an officers' dinner Ramsey and the crew pontificate about the threat of nuclear war. Ramsey is eager to know Hunter's views on the subject especially since the XO has a degree in philosophy. Hunter states the the true nature of war is to serve itself and leave the world destroyed. Ramsey takes the opinion seriously although he seems to disagree with his XO.On patrol off the eastern coast of Russia the Alabama runs drills. When a fire breaks out in the galley Hunter rushes to help put the blaze out. At that moment Ramsey orders a missile launching drill to be performed. Hunter is perturbed that Ramsey would order a drill in the midst of an emergency but reports to the bridge to oversee the transfer of coded transmissions and report to Ramsey. During a lull in the drill Hunter informs the captain that the fire in the galley could flare up again but Ramsey dismisses him concentrating on the drill. A report comes in from below decks; one of the crew has suffered a heart attack. Ramsey cancels the drill and goes below to check on the crew member who has died.Ramsey orders Hunter into his cabin and reprimands him for trying to interrupt the drill. Hunter calmly counters that the fire needed more attention and that the captain's calling for a drill had jeopardized the safety of the boat. Ramsey tells the XO that confusion aboard a submarine is something to be taken advantage of. Hunter still obviously disagrees however he chooses not to say so.The Alabama receives an emergency action message (EAM) informing them that Radchenko is very close to breaking the codes for missile launch and that the US defense readiness has been raised to DEFCON 3. Further patrols with the Alabama's crew on even higher alert will be necessary. A fight breaks out between a petty officer Rivetti (Danny Nucci) and another man Bennefield (Eric Bruskotter) over the origins of the Silver Surfer and Hunter breaks it up telling Rivetti to act like a leader. Hunter reports to Ramsey about the altercation and the tension amongst the crew over the their current state of readiness. Ramsey announces to the crew over the boat's PA system that infighting will not be tolerated and the threat of war is of the utmost importance.In the sub's sonar cabin Rivetti and his unit detect an enemy submarine possibly one of the Akulas that Radchenko has command of. Ramsey orders him to identify the sub and orders an evasion maneuver to escape detection by the Akula. An EAM arrives seemingly ordering a launch of the Alabama's missiles. Ramsey orders the procedures for launch to be initiated. Another EAM comes in but the Alabama is too deep to receive it. Hunter requests that the sub's buoy be launched to receive the EAM. The buoy winch fails causing noise and alerting the Akula to the Alabama's location. The Akula attacks with torpedoes. The Alabama successfully evades the torpedoes one of which explodes very close severing the buoy cable. The Alabama suffers minor damage the Akula disappears from sonar and the buoy cable is severed cutting off the EAM. Additionally the radio equipment has suffered severe damage and no messages are going out or coming in.Ramsey and Hunter review the EAM finding that the message doesn't contain any clear order. Hunter recommends that the Alabama surface to receive the rest of the message but Ramsey refuses saying it's too dangerous with the Akula still nearby. Ramsey intends to continue with the launch of his missiles but Hunter quickly disagrees saying the incomplete message could be a target package change or an order to cancel the launch. Ramsey counters saying that the message is not a complete order and not to be followed up upon and orders Hunter to repeat his command to launch. Hunter refuses under Navy regulations citing the fact that Ramsey's order must be repeated for it to stand concluding that the captain is acting irrationally. When Ramsey will not concur with Hunter the XO orders Ramsey to be arrested and locked in his cabin. A hesitant Chief of the Boat concurs with the XO and has the captain detained. Hunter assumes command and informs the crew that they will still patrol at the same state of readiness and attempt to re-establish communications to verify the EAM.On sonar the Akula reappears and attacks launching torpedoes. Hunter orders an evasion plan and the Alabama avoids being hit. Hunter launches two more torpedoes which connect with their target and destroy the Akula. However a last torpedo was launched by the Akula before it was destroyed and explodes very close to the Alabama. Propulsion is damaged and the bilge bay takes on water despite the efforts of several crew members to contain it. The men in the bilge bay drown when Hunter orders the bilge bay sealed. Meanwhile the Alabama is sinking rapidly approaching a depth of 1850 feet where the intense water pressure will crush the hull. Propulsion is restored before the boat can be destroyed and the boat rises to a safe depth.Several of Ramsey's officers decide that Hunter is unfit for command and they plot a counter-mutiny to free Ramsey. They persuade Weps to join them and give them the key to the weapons locker to take the sub back by force. They free Ramsey who follows the armed men back to the bridge where they arrest Hunter and the other officers who aided him in the mutiny. Ramsey assumes command and order the launch to continue. While in detention Hunter talks philosophically about the choice to launch nuclear missiles and start the destruction of the world.Rivetti while walking between cabins is stopped by the same man he fought with earlier. Rivetti is able to overpower the larger man and free Hunter and the other arrested officers. They make their way back to the bridge to stop Ramsey from launching. After a tense altercation in the weapons cabin which delays Ramsey long enough for Hunter to seize the master missile key the two face off on the bridge. Ramsey hits Hunter in the face twice demanding his missile key back. Communications reports that the radio is very close to being operational. Ramsey allows three minutes for the radio to operate again and receive another EAM. The two sit in the command center awaiting the message. While they do Ramsey lights a cigar and brings up the subject of horse riding again saying that Lipizzaner stallions are from Portugal. Hunter tells the captain they're Spanish horses born with a black color and turn white later in life. Ramsey still insists they're from Portugal.Rivetti reports that the EAM transmitter is fixed and that a new EAM is coming in. It's brought to the bridge and authenticated. When authenticated the message is for the Alabama to stand down and cancel the launch of their missiles. Ramsey retires himself from the bridge and is saluted as he walks to his cabin.In Pearl Harbor Hawaii a general inquiry is called before the Pacific Fleet admiral (Jason Robards). Having reviewed the incident he tells both Hunter and Ramsey that they both were right and wrong in their actions aboard the Alabama. Off the record he admonishes both of them saying they've done much to disrupt the traditional chain of command of the Navy. The admiral also announces to Hunter's surprise that Ramsey has filed for retirement. Hunter is further astonished when he hears that he is to be given a captain's commission aboard another submarine and that he came highly recommended by Ramsey himself.Outside Navy HQ Ramsey is retrieving his dog from an ensign. He sees Hunter and tells him that he was right about the Lipizzaner stallions being from Spain. The two smile and salute each other."

"Immediately after his apparent demise at the end of Phantasm II a new Tall Man emerges from the white room dimension fork. During this time the hearse driving Liz and Mike carries on and explodes. Reggie who was attacked by the Alchemy/Tall Man creature rushes over and finds Liz dead and a dwarf devouring her face. After killing a few dwarfs with his 4-barrel shotgun the Tall Man appears apprehending Reggie and an unconscious Mike but leaves when Reggie threatens to detonate a grenade. Stating that he wants Mike in one piece the Tall Man leaves with Liz's head in hand claiming to return for Mike when he's well again.After apparently spending two years comatose in a hospital Mike has a near death experience in which his brother Jody appears and tells him he's not ready to cross over into the light. Mike walks on but the Tall Man stands in his way causing him to wake up. Just as Reggie arrives Mike is attacked by a demon nurse but fights her off. A sphere emerges from her head and crashes out through the window. Back at home Jody appears again to warn Mike but the Tall Man arrives via dimension fork fights off Reggie and Jody (now forcibly transformed into a charred flying sphere) and draws Mike through the gate with him.The next morning Reggie (with the Jody-sphere) travels to the small town of Holtsville which turns out to be deserted. Reggie is captured by three looters who lock him in his Cuda's trunk and drive on to another house. There they are attacked and killed by a little boy named Tim who also releases Reggie.After they have buried three looters in the yard Tim tells Reggie how the Tall Man took his parents and destroyed the town. In the morning Reggie and Tim find the three graves empty and their pink hearse gone. Setting out to find the Tall Man Reggie wants to leave Tim with a woman looking after orphans but the boy hides in the trunk and comes along.Reggie enters the Holtsville mausoleum and is confronted by a sphere. Before he can destroy it he is assaulted and subdued by two young black women Tanesha and Rocky. Reg tries to warn them but the sphere kills Tanesha as well as damaging Rocky's nunchaku. Tim appears and shoots it out of the air with his pistol. The three join forces and drive on looking for a town called Boulton which contains a large mortuary. On their way the come across a convoy of hearses driven by gravers and follow them.As they camp outside the Jody-sphere floats over to Reggie. In a dream Jody appears and leads Reggie to the Tall Man's lair where Mike is imprisoned in a small cell. The two free him but the Tall Man reappears and pursues the three. Jody is transformed back into a sphere and Reggie awakes. Jody appears again opens another gate and Mike emerges. The Tall Man tries to emerge as well but Reggie manages to shut the gate just as he was about to reach through cutting off the Tall Man's hands. They manage to fight off the small creatures the hands morph into and also later the pink hearse containing the three comically-zombified looters.They reach Boulton mortuary where they come across a cryonics facility which reminds Mike that the Tall Man dislikes cold. While Reggie Rocky and Tim are separately attacked by the looters Mike consults with the Jody-sphere who explains that the Tall Man is amassing an army to conquer dimensions. He also shows him in a dream what the Tall Man does with the dwarf creatures he has created from the dead: he removes the sapient part of the brains to create the spheres turning the body into a drone and the mind into a killer. The Tall Man senses their presence and before they can leave and paralyzes Mike. Surrounded by hundreds of spheres the Tall Man reaches for Mike who wakes up and finds himself strapped to the table. The Tall Man grabs and subdues the Jody-sphere and welcomes Mike. Soon after two of the looters Rufus and Henry wheel in Tim. Mike tries to give a message to the boy saying ""There are thousands of them"" but is paralyzed beyond speech by the Tall Man.Rocky meanwhile manages to shake off her attacker and goes on to fight off Reggie's. Cut free by the Jody-sphere Tim runs into the remaining looters who are killed by the Jody-sphere and Reggie's 4-barrel shotgun. The trio crash into the embalming room where the Tall Man has begun operating on Mike. Rocky impales the Tall Man with a spear dipped in liquid nitrogen causing his flesh to begin melting. Rocky and Reggie lock him into the refrigerator room. A golden sphere breaks out of his head crashes outside and chases through the corridors. Surprised by the golden sphere Reggie catches it with a plunger and is almost overpowered by it. With help from Rocky and Tim he submerges the sphere in the nitrogen tank neutralizing it.In the meantime Mike climbs from the table and sees yellow blood issuing from his wound. He looks into a mirror and sees a golden sphere in his own head concealed his torn skin. Just after the Tall Man's sphere has been dumped into the nitrogen Mike appears showing silver eyeballs complaining of the cold and walking outside. Reggie chases after him but Mike warns him to stay away. Jody leaves as well telling Reggie that they'll be in touch.Reggie suggests searching the mortuary but Rocky leaves having had enough of dealing with the undead. Reggie and Tim go back inside and Tim reports that Mike said that ""There are thousands of them."" Unknown to them dozens of spheres are hovering above them.In the next room Tim finds the poles of the dimension fork and the nitrogen tank overturned. He goes back to find Reggie pinned to the wall by force of the spheres.

before beheading him. Meanwhile Van Helsing arrives at Mary's house only
to find Dracula waiting for him. ""You can't have her!"" Van Helsing
exclaims but Dracula refuses to listen. ""You stole life from my blood and
passed it to another"" he hisses. ""She's MY Mary now."" With that Dracula
kills Van Helsing by tossing him into a mirror.Mary goes home to find her father dead and the three vampiresses and
Dracula awaiting her. She escapes into Simon's arms. Looking for a sacred
place to spend the night they go to a church. While in the parish

already know about his despise of all things Christian--holy water the
cross the Bible. Only his dislike of silver remains unexplained.

attempts to divert Dracula with an open Bible. Dracula *is*
diverted...right into the cemetery where he explains to Mary ""I have
walked the earth for centuries in search of a soul not bitten but born.
Everything I am is yours and all that you are is mine.""Dracula takes Mary to the church roof where he reveals to her the
secret of his long existence. He is Judas Iscariot the disciple who sold
out Christ to the Romans for 30 pieces of silver (hence Dracula's dislike
of silver). In atonement Judas hung himself but the rope broke and God
scourged him with eternal life as a vampire. In a soliloquy in front of a
lighted crucifix Dracula cries out to God ""Now I drink the blood of
*your* children. You made the world in your image. Now I make it in mine.""Meanwhile Simon sees the three vampiresses feasting on Mardi Gras
revelers. He stakes Valerie but the remaining two capture him. Dracula
takes Mary to Simon and tells her to feed from him. ""I'd like his head""
Mary says while unsheathing a sword. Just as she prepares to swing the
sword Lucy cries out ""She's faking!"" In the melee that follows Mary
beheads Lucy instead of Simon Simon beheads Solina and Dracula winds up
hanging by his neck from the lighted crucifix...just as the sun comes up.
Dracula bursts into flames. Mary vows to take over her father's job of keeping Dracula's ashes lest Dracula find a way to return to life.

"Rome Italy The 21st Century. WBS TV's chief of programming Cortez (Claudio Cassinelli) is fuming at the constituently high ratings enjoyed by a rival American companys show 'Kill-Bike' contests The show has features gladiatorial fights to the death on motorcycles and has made a hero of a man called Drake (Jared Martin) the unbeaten champion. Cortez is all the more bitter because it was he who discovered Drake in the first place. WBS's current answer to the American show is 'The Danger Game' a simulation game showing the hallucinations of a contestant experiencing the approach of violent death. Fear panic and screaming at the extremely realistic simulations triggers a further increase in the intensity. Unfortunately for the station even this spectacle fails to compete against the American show.Cortez and his two female assistants Sybil (Penny Brown) and Sarah (Eleanor Gold) receive a video message from the mysterious station boss Sam demanding that they recreate the formula of gladiatorial contest and set them back to where they began: in the Coliseum. Sam orders the WBS station a sort-of flying saucer controlled by a computer system called Junior to fly over there and initiate training of the future contestants who will be chosen from the Death Rows around the world. Meanwhile Drake has been imprisoned for the murder of three men who killed his wife Susan (Valerie Jones) after they broke into his house and he (conveniently for WBS) is now under the sentence of death for taking the law in his own hands.Drake is brought to the training compound and a detector strip is seared into his wrist. There he has to contend with the sadistic Chief of the Praetorian Guard Raven (Howard Ross) and the hostility of the other future contestants. Some of them are introduced; Abdul (Fred Williamson) is an African-American Muslim extremist; Akira (Haruiko Yamanouchi) is a notorious Japanese serial killer; Kirk (Al Cliver) is a German-born robber/killer; and Tango (Tony Sanders) is a Latin American terrorist. Drake also meets an old friend of his from his WBS days a deformed employee with a fiber optic eye called Monk (Donald O'Brien) who offers Drake some reassurance.The next day Drake is strapped into a 'hate stimulator' device designed to measure the point when man can be provoked into murder. Despite the best efforts of the machine which creates holographic images of his wife's killers taunting him Drake does not crack. Cortez's assistant Sarah is perturbed by this and becomes attracted to the prisoner. Drake soon earns the respect of the other prisoners after facing off in a battle of wits with the vicious Raven who is impotent to actually harm the prisoners because of the upcoming TV show. Sarah meets and befriends Drake and shows him videotape evidence she has discovered that proves he was set up for his wifes murder merely to get him on the show. A strangely powerful microprocessor smuggled in by Monk facilities an escape attempt. When it fails footage of Drake and the other prisoners in their escape attempt turns up immediately on the TV news. Who is the mystery cameraman? Raven is given limited access to torture the prisoners with electric shocks. But the harrowing experience bonds the principle gladiators even more. Meanwhile Cortez is becoming more enraged by Sarah's investigation of Drake.The following evening Sarah visits Professor Towman (Cosimo Cinieri) the inventor of Junior the WBS computer system looking for a way to gain access to the restricted files. The professor has become a mystic and talks about his inevention's soul. Professor Towman gives Sarah a pass-chip to access the computer when he is suddenly murdered by a unseen assailant. Sarah gives chase and sees that the killer is Sybil. But before Sarah can try to capture Sybil she too is shot and killed by an unseen assailant.Meanwhile the WBS Gladiator Contest commences with each contesting racing around the modified arena in modified motorcycle carts fighting in a chariot-like run. Many contestants are killed including Tango. Suddenly Sarah interrupts the games by riding into the arena on a motorcycle. She has discovered from the computer chip that Junior will trigger the bracelet devices of all the surviving gladiators to kill them all 20 minutes after the show ends. Revealing this information to Drake and the rest of the men they mount an attack on the control tower killing all the guards including Raven. But most of the gladiators including Akira are killed in the assault. Drake Sarah Abdul and Kirk break into the main control room and discover that Cortez is found to have plotted the death of the survivors in order to discredit Sam and take over as station head. Cortez is killed by Abdul who shoots him. Then a computer screen image of the company boss Sam appears and informs them that 'Sam' is really just a video projection of the computer emanating from a space satellite 200000 miles above the Earth. The computer knew of Cortez plan but let it happen to a point.The four surviving rebels force entry into the main terminal of 'Sam' with the aid of Sarah's pass key. But Kirk is killed when he unwisely tries to remove his bracelet himself. Then the three surviving rebels are attacked in the control room by Monk who is revealed to be the traitor who filmed the escape attempt with a mini-camera built into his eye. After a bitter fight Drake kills him and Sarah uses some of the information stored on his camera chip to access the destruction codes. In the nick of time Sam is blown up and the deadly bracelets are deactivated. With the battle won Drake and Sarah fly off together in a hover-vehicle to start a new life for themselves elsewhere.

Unemployed cowhand and one-time rancher Jim Garry answers his friend Tate Riling's call to help him out in a dispute between a group of homesteaders and cattle rancher John Lufton. What Garry learns is that his old friend has cooked up a scheme with the local Indian agent to cancel Lufton's contract to supply beef and then buy his cattle at rock bottom prices. Garry also concludes that he's fighting on the wrong side and decides to help out Lufton and his family.::garykmcd
Texan Jim Garry responds to a summons from his old pal Tate Riling in New Mexico to aid him in a cattle project in which old John Lufton is to be the victim. Jim has an encounter with Lufton's fiery daughter Amy in which they exchange shots. In town Jim finds that Riling needs him as a gunman in the event there is resistance by Lufton and his ranch hands to the scheme in which Jake Pindalest the government's Indian Agent is to force Lufton's cattle herds off of the government range so that Riling can buy them at a low price. Jim dislikes the set-up especially the use of Lufton's other daughter to tip-off her father's plans and an attempt to assassinate the old cattleman. Jim foils that. In a skirmish between cowhands and homesteaders set-up by a Riling ruse the son Fred of an old-timer Kris Barden is killed and Jim declares himself through with Riling and starts home for Texas.

Filmed in the style of such Hollywood action classics as Bullitt and The French Connection the first image we see in Wolves Don't Eat Meat is through the scope of a rooftop sniper's rifle just before he makes a kill. A frantic chase through the streets of town follows as the assassin Anwar makes his getaway. Wounded and exhausted Anwar stumbles into the home of a stranger where he is allowed to recuperate and his story unfolds. We learn that he was once an ambitious journalist who has been transformed into a slaughterer of men by the years of war suffering and destruction he has witnessed around the world - starting with the massacre at Deir Yassin in Palestine. A message film about good vs. evil and the negative effects of violence Wolves Don't Eat Meat nevertheless employs the trademark sex violence and bloodshed popularized in Hollywood action films of the 1970s a style that later influenced the films of directors such as Quentin Tarantino and Oliver Stone.::Ryan Davis AFD

"As the movie opens the young Benjamin Franklin Gates (Hunter Gomez) is snooping around an attic when his grandfather John Adams Gates (Christopher Plummer) catches him. Ben wants to hear the story of the Gates family history so his grandfather begins reciting:In 1832 Charles Carroll --- the last surviving signer of the Declaration of Independence --- traveled to the White House desperate to speak with President Jackson before his death. But since the President wasn't at the White House that night Carroll had no choice but to share his closely-guarded secret with his stable boy Ben's ancestor Thomas Gates. Carroll told Gates about a fabulous treasure that had existed throughout history collected by pharaohs and emperors for hundreds of years before being discovered by a group called the Knights Templar. The Knights believed the treasure to be too great for any one man so they secretly smuggled it out of Europe and over to America. By the time the treasure had been taken to America the Revolutionary War was raging. The Knights had formed a secondary group called the Freemasons had recruited members like George Washington Benjamin Franklin and Paul Revere and had formulated a number of secret clues and maps in a desperate attempt to keep the treasure from falling into the hands of the British. As the war ended and time went on all of the clues were lost except one the clue belonging to Charles Carroll: ""The Secret Lies With Charlotte."" Sadly even Carroll himself didn't know the meaning of that clue.John's son and Ben's father Patrick Gates (Jon Voight) comes in to take Ben home. He is obviously skeptical about the existence of the treasure. Ben asks if the Gates family are actually Knights. John does an impromptu ritual and pronounces Ben to be a Knight Templar to the family Gates.Many years later the adult Ben Gates (Nicolas Cage) and his team of researches are traveling across the Arctic Circle. Fellow travelers include the financial backer Ian Howe (Sean Bean) and Ben's friend Riley Poole (Justin Bartha). The group stumbles across a figure buried in the ice. They carve it out using special tools and find the remains of a ship: the ""Charlotte."" Ben leads them inside but the ship's cargo hold only holds barrels with gunpowder... except for one barrel that is guarded by the captain's corpse; the preserved hand holding a musket. Ben opens the barrel and uncovers a carved ivory meerschaum pipe. He discovers a stamp-like imprint on the pipe's base. Coating it with a little of his blood he rolls the imprint along a paper and unearths a riddle: ""The legend writ the stain affected. The key in Silence undetected. Fifty-five in iron pen Mr. Matlack can't offend.""Ben deciphers the riddle step by step: The key and legend both refer to a map and the stain affected and key in Silence undetected is a dye or reagent needed to make the next clue visible to the naked eye. Iron refers to a firm resolution and Timothy Matlack was the scribe for the Continental Congress; 55 members of which signed a resolution that Mr. Matlack penned... the Declaration of Independence. Ian Howe wants to find a way to take a closer look at the document but Ben is unwilling to take the chance to get close to such a historical artifact. Ian thinks they should steal the Declaration to find the map and the treasure but Ben flatly refuses. Ian finally turns on Ben and Riley stealing the pipe and stranding them while setting the Charlotte to blow up. Ben & Riley escape harm and head back to civilization.Back in the United States Ben and Riley are meeting with Dr. Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger) an expert in historical documents in charge of the Declaration. Ben uses the alias ""Paul Brown"" because his family's history doesn't allow for much respect in the academic world. Ben notices that Abigail has a collection of George Washington's campaign buttons but is missing one. Riley and Ben attempt to convince Abigail that someone is attempting to steal the Declaration of Independence because of an invisible treasure map (something they have attempted to convince both the FBI and the DHS and failed). Abigail does not believe them either and sends them out.Ben decides there is only one option: He and Riley have to steal the Declaration to keep it from falling into the wrong hands. Ben figures out the best way through the security systems would be during an event hosted by the National Archives later that week. Riley manages to patch into the security systems so he can guide Ben through the theft. In the meantime Ben sends Dr. Chase the missing button for her collection as a gift.The night of the gala event Ben manages to infiltrate the gallery disguised in a work uniform with Riley speaking to him over a tiny two-way radio. He quickly switches to a tuxedo and speaks with Dr. Chase offering her a glass of champagne in order to get her thumbprint which opens a security door for him. As Ben gets inside Ian and his group also prepare to infiltrate and take the document.Ben gets into the Preservation Room with Dr. Chase's password (""Valley Forge"") and stands before the Declaration. Just then Ian's group cuts the security feed disrupting Riley's video. With no time to lose Ben takes the entire Declaration case and leaves-only to come face to face with Ian. Ian's henchman shoots at Ben but it is blocked by the Declaration's bulletproof case. As Ben gets into the elevator he removes the Declaration from the case and carries it with him. Abigail checks the invitation list and finds that the name Ben used Paul Brown isn't on it. Understanding that Abigail is on to him Ben ducks into a gift shop to escape her notice. He is stopped by a gift shop attendant who thinks he is attempting to steal one of their replica souvenirs. Without enough cash to actually buy one Ben has no choice but to use his VISA card.As Ben makes it outside he is confronted by Abigail --- just as the security alarms go off. Ben tosses the souvenir at her and runs. Abigail is then abducted by Ian because his team thinks she has the Declaration. Ben and Riley chase after her through downtown Washington saving Abigail as Ian speeds off.In Riley's van Abigail is hysterical until Ben shows her that he has the actual Declaration. Ben also confesses his real name and Abigail recognizes it as ""that family with the conspiracy theory about the Founding Fathers.""Back at the National Archives FBI Agents led by Peter Sadusky (Harvey Keitel) are investigating the theft. Based on the bullets fired they believe that there were two sets of agents acting in this theft. Sadusky looks up the security files and sees Ben paying with his VISA in the gift shop.Ben knows they need the Silence Dogood Letters (a pseudonym used in a set of letters written by Benjamin Franklin) for decoding the map (that is the ""Key in Silence undetected"" mentioned by the riddle.) Since they no longer have the duplicates they will have to speak with the man who has the originals --- Ben's father.Patrick is not in any mood to discuss the treasure. He believes that the treasure was merely something invented by Freemasons to keep the British forces occupied during the Revolutionary War.Ben Abigail and Riley finally look at the Declaration of Independence. Abigail carefully swabs some lemon juice along one corner of the back looking accusingly at Ben when nothing happens. But Patrick reminds them that ferrous sulfate inks only become visible when heat is applied. Ben and Abigail use a blow dryer and find an Ottendorf cipher referring to lines from Silence Dogood's letters. Patrick explains that he no longer has the letters: they were donated to the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia. When Patrick finds out that Ben has stolen the Declaration he is speechless. He knows the FBI will be coming to see him soon so he and Ben come up with an idea to make it look like he wasn't aiding and helping a wanted fugitive.The FBI storms Patrick's house finding Patrick tied up and his car missing. Ben and the others are driving to Philadelphia and Ben decides they should buy some new clothes with the money he took from his father's house.When they arrive at Philadelphia Riley (fearful of being spotted) pays a schoolchild to go in and collect the letters for the cipher. Spotting Ian Riley bolts before he can get the last four letters. Riley catches up to Ben and Abigail (now in new clothes) and shares the new riddle: ""The vision to see the treasured past comes as the timely shadow crosses in front of the house of Pass and..."" Riley figures out that the last line is ""Stow"" referring to Pass & Stow; the casters of the Liberty Bell. Ben thinks the ""timely shadow"" refers to a specific time they need to be at the Liberty Bell. Looking at a picture of the Bell on the back of a $100 bill Ben figures that the time is 2:22 pm. Since it is now just 3pm Ben thinks they have missed it. Riley surprised that he knows something about history that Ben doesn't know points out that Daylight Savings Time didn't exist in America until World War One; thus 3pm today would be 2pm in 1776.In the meantime Ian who'd seen the schoolboy and gotten suspicious has bribed him to tell Ian what he'd been doing. The schoolboy gives Ian the last four letters S-T-O-W. Ian googles it finding the reference to the Liberty Bell.Ben watches the ""timely shadow"" fall across the courtyard and finds a brick inscribed with the Freemason's symbol. He carves it out to find an Ocular Device designed by Benjamin Franklin. He puts it on and looks at the map to see the words ""Heere at the Wall."" Just then they spot Ian and his group approaching. They split up to try and get away but Ian ends up getting the Declaration. Ben decides they should meet up again at the car but he is captured by Federal agents upon his return.Ben explains the story to Sadusky who is skeptical. Sadusky asks Ben for his help in recovering the Declaration for them. As Sadusky examines the Ocular Device Ben realizes that there may be more to the map. Ben gets a call on a cell phone from Ian who wants the Ocular Device and offers to meet with Ben. The FBI will use this opportunity to arrest Ian and get back the Declaration.In New York Ben is on the deck of a battleship with FBI agents undercover all around him. A helicopter flies overhead while one of Ian's henchmen talks to Ben (they used the copter to talk without the FBI observing). Ben walks over to the edge of of the ship's deck and jumps into the Hudson River. As he sinks a figure in a scuba suit gives Ben an oxygen valve and escorts him to safety.Ian meets with Ben as he comes out of the water with the Declaration and the Charlotte pipe and explains that the meet-up was a ruse to get Ben out of FBI custody. Ian has made a deal with Riley and Abigail: if he gets Ben out of FBI custody they will lead Ian directly to the treasure. Ben with Riley and Abigail observing at an Internet Cafe takes Ian to a corner of Broadway and Wall Street telling hims this is where the map leads: ""Heere at the Wall;"" Heere being the original Dutch name for Broadway.Ian knows that Ben isn't telling him everything and he has a contingency plan: He has kidnapped Ben's father and is holding him as a hostage. Ben relents telling Ian they need to go to Trinity Church (the logo of which was marked by the map's last clue.)At the Church Ben and Ian view the Declaration through all three lenses of the Ocular Device and see the words ""Beneath Parkington Lane."" They figure out that it refers to an ancient street once located beneath the church. While exploring the church they find the name ""Parkington Lane"" engraved on a tombstone of a master Mason. Ian's cronies remove the coffin (destroying the remains in the process) and find a long tunnel. When they reach the bottom Ben kisses Abigail in an attempt to apologize to her.They find a huge set of stairs and a dumbwaiter. Upon reaching the bottom they find an empty room. Riley wonders what to do next and asks Ben to help them. Ben despondent snaps and says they are at a dead end. Ian threatens to shoot Ben unless he reveals the next clue. Patrick saves his son by pointing out a lantern hanging in the temple- referring to the lantern in Old North Church in Boston hung during the night of Paul Revere's ride. Ian decides to leave them there and go to Boston; he will only come back if he needs any more help.As Ian leaves Abigail quickly points out that there were TWO lanterns in Old North Church not one because the British came by sea. Patrick explains that he lied and gave Ian a fake clue to get away. Ben examining the room finds an eye symbol on a wall with a slight raised area and deduces that there is indeed another way out of there. They press the raised area and another door opens into another larger but still empty room.Ben is devastated. He thinks that the treasure is gone and may have even been moved long before the Gates family learned of it. Ben thinks that he has wasted everything. Patrick on the other hand is inspired- the very fact that such a room exists proves that the treasure is indeed real.The Gates' and Abigail vow to keep looking but Riley points out that they are still trapped. Ben explains that the setup doesn't make sense; builders would've cut a secondary entry shaft to protect against cave-ins during the construction. Ben sees several Freemason symbols engraved on another wall. One of them is a hollow carving resembling the Meerschaum pipe found aboard the Charlotte... 'The Secret lies with Charlotte.' Ben takes the pipe's base apart from its bowl and inserts the bowl into the hollow; using the shaft as a handle. He then rotates the hollow; which opens another door.The travelers enter a room filled with golden goblets suits of armor and other ancient relics. Ben lights a torch in the middle and they see that the room is truly enormous filled with tens of thousands of artifacts. Patrick rejoices: the treasure has been found! Riley is equally happy; he sees the stairs to get out of there.Ben meets up with Agent Sadusky and hands over the Declaration of Independence. Ben offers Sadusky a ""bribe--"" ten billion dollars (his approximation of the treasure's worth). Sadusky recites a quote from the Freemasons about the treasure being too great for any one man; revealing that he is actually one of the Freemasons as well (Ben looks down and sees a Freemason's ring on Sadusky's finger). Sadusky asks Ben what will be done with the treasure. Ben decides that the treasure will be given to the entire world; donated to its most prestigious museums and historical societies (Smithsonian Louvre Cairo Museum). Ben gives credit to the entire Gates family and Riley Poole for the find and insists that Abigail had nothing to do with the theft and should have no bad marks on her record. As for Ben himself he's desperate to avoid going to prison but Sadusky repeats ""Somebody's got to go to prison.""In Boston Ian is breaking into Old North Church when the FBI comes in to arrest him-for kidnapping attempted murder and trespassing on government property.Three months later Ben and Abigail are dating and Riley is acting as the group's agent. They've been invited to the grand opening of the treasure exhibits that have been donated to the Cairo Museum. Riley is still upset about their ""finder's fee:"" Ben was offered 10% of the treasure's worth but believed that amount was too high and took only 1% split evenly with Riley. Riley has used part of his money to buy a swanky new Ferrari while Ben has bought a house that once belonged to Charles Carroll.

Once it is discovered that Miranda is blind (she had fooled them with a complicated neural sensor in her dress) and cannot guide the Enterprise Spock mind-melds with the navigationally proficient ambassador who quickly gets the Enterprise back in known galactic space. However while severing the mind-meld he forgets the visor sees Kollos and goes insane. Because of her jealousy of Spock's relationship with Kollos Miranda hesitates to give help but with Kirk's urging reconsiders and helps Spock take control of his mind.::JW Kearse
The Enterprise is tasked with transporting the Medusan ambassador to his home planet along with his human aide Miranda Jones. Medusans are formless creatures the very sight of whom will cause humans to go insane. For that reason only Mr. Spock can be in the same room with ambassador.

"On a motorboat traveling off the coast of Honolulu Hawaii someone is seen dumping two large containers into the ocean and then going to meet with a few guys in business suits expecting to get paid. But because he dumped the containers to avoid detection by the police and altered the schedule of those container shipments to the customer he is killed.The next day Sebastian (Chris Carmack) and his girlfriend Dani (Laura Vandervoort) are dive surfing with a model. We learn that the group owns a snorkeling business that rents out equipment for clients (mostly mainland tourists). Sebastian doesn't want to do this line of work forever. For Sebastian there are countless treasures in the ocean that he has been in search of for a long time but one that he has been searching for four years is the Spanish ship San Cristobal which sank somewhere near the North Reef and is rumored to have sunk in the ocean with a lot of treasure. Sebastian believes that if he finds this treasure this will give him and his girlfriend the opportunity to live a better life.Sebastian hangs out with his friend and employee Mace (Michael Graziadei) and his girlfriend Kimi (Mircea Monroe) Dani's best friend who are a couple that have a difficult relationship because Mace tends to flirt with other women. While Mace and Kimi have a crazy relationship Sebastian and Dani are very much in love.While at work they are visited by Carlton (David Anders) and Azra (Marsha Thomason) a couple who wants to hire them for diving in the North Reef for a week because they are looking for the San Cristobal.
Of course Sebastian has been trying for several years to find it but Carlton happens to have a map which may lead them to the treasure. So both Sebastian and Dani willingly agree to help the couple. The four go on various diving expeditions to find treasure.Over the next few days we get to see some of the beach life as all six individuals enjoy the beach. Dani Kimi Sebastian and Mace get involved in separate beach volleyball competitions. Sebastian and Mace go against their main diving competitors Avery (Rand Holdren) who dates a girl named Kelsey (Audrina Patridge) who loves to lecture him when he gets into trouble by messing around with women.While at a nightclub a random guy hits on the women and grabs the arm of Azra who quickly puts him in a headlock. This raises the first red flag for Dani who becomes suspicious that Azra and Carlton are not who they claim to be.The following day we learn that Carlton is not really looking for the San Cristobal. He actually helps high-paying clients smuggle drugs and other contraband stuff and treasure to other locations. Both Carlton and Azra tell Sebastian and Dani that if they help them find the two containers they will earn $500000. Also we learn that if Carlton doesn't find the containers in a week the men whom hired him will kill him. The reason why he is willing to pay them a lot of money is part of an apology because the men who hired him know the names of Sebastian and Dani and their lives are in danger too. So now both Sebastian and Dani are forced to help Carlton and Azra find the two containers but while they are at sea Avery takes notice and he starts looking to find whatever they are looking for.With their lives threatened Dani convinces Sebastian that they must look to see what is in those containers and why their lives are being threatened. Something terrible could be in those containers and that they need to check them without bringing Carlton and Azra along.Thus the two take their boat out to sea late at night to dive and see what those containers are. What they find in the containers are not treasure but a bomb. When they return from their boat after the dive they are greeted by Carlton and Azra who have been hiding in their boat and are ready to kill them. Carlton tells him that in container one there is the casing and in container two there is a nuclear warhead. One without the other is useless but together it creates a powerful weapon. Their ""clients"" goal is to create a second Pearl Harbor by detonating the nuclear weapon in Hololulu and thus place the blame on a shadowy terrorist group to justify rallying the USA public to support the need to continue the war on terrorism.Dani jumps off the boat to try and get help. She is found in the morning one mile off shore and is put in the hospital. Azra arrives at the hospital where she tries to kill her but Dani runs away and a chase ensues.Meanwhile Sebastian and Mace try to bring up the containers for Carlton. Mace purposely messes up and Kimi is killed. Enraged Sebastian and Mace rebel ending with Carlton and his bodyguard dead. Dani outruns Azra and calls the police to report the situation. However Azra escapes and reports back to her boss of the failure of their job. But Azra kills her boss so she can disappear again and not have the police nor her powerful business clients come looking for her. Dani Sebastian and Mace reunite in which the police arrive and manage to confiscate and defuse the bomb. They then have Kimi's funeral.The movie concludes six months later where Sebastian Dani and Mace find the San Cristobal wreck and with the gold they find they finally buy their someday boat.

"A pot-boiling B-film with the first-reel plot premise akin to the later (and good) ""Flight of the Phoenix"" but the crashed-cast of this one didn't have a German-genius model-plane designer on board. This one has four men scouting for oil lands in the desert in a plane which is forced down during a sandstorm. The plane is damaged beyond repair --- end of the ""Phoenix"" similarity --- but lo and behold the storm has uncovered a German tank which has lay buried since WWII. The men --- Mike Monohan the pilot; mechanic Jim Evans from Brooklyn of course and capable of mechanical miracles with hair-pins and tweezers; radioman Billy Larsen only along because the producers were under the mistaken impression he was a box-office draw; and Syd Barlow along because the producers needed at least one good actor among the leads --- repair the tank and head off over yonder toward a French Army post many sandy miles away. Barlow whiskey-swiggin' semi-villain of the group discovers a cache of jewels hidden in the tank and plans on keeping them for himself. The tank runs low on water which the crew didn't think about when they filled up with gas at the unseen Exxon station but an Arab encampment at an oasis is just over the lo-and-behold again horizon. But the Arabs recognize the German tank as the one that hauled off some local treasure many sandstorms ago and the pot begins to boil even hotter for the crew of the ""Phoenix""... uh the ""Steel Lady.""::Les Adams <longhorn1939@suddenlink.net>"

That night Paul Katherine and the twins are on their way home when Paul notices a carload of Chinese men following them. Paul uses his CB radio to alert his friend Frank Avery to the situation. Paul and Katherine arrive home with the twins a few minutes later and see that waiting for them is a gang of Chinese men led by a musclebound assassin named Moon. Moon and his men shoot both Paul and Katherine dead and plan to kill the twins -- until Frank shows up and kills all of Moon's henchmen but Frank gets shot while Moon escapes. Chad and Alex end up separated. 25 years later Chad is a martial arts expert and aerobics trainer in Los Angeles. Frank raised Chad in Paris France after the murders.

They board an airplane to Hong Kong. Hours later they arrive in Hong Kong. On that night they go to a Mah Jongg Parlor and go inside. Chad is approached by a blond haired woman who obviously thinks he's someone else then a man who looks like Chad knocks Chad out cold. The man is Alex and the woman is Alex's fiance Danielle Wilde who thought Chad was Alex. She Chad and Alex are all surprised to be told by Frank that Chad and Alex are brothers. Alex and Danielle have a hard time believing it. Frank explains that Paul supervised the construction of the Victoria Harbour Tunnel. Halfway into the project Paul encountered financial problems so he pulled in Nigel Griffith as an equity partner. Nigel got his money from a secret loan courtesy of Hong Kong drug kingpin Raymond Zhang. When the tunnel was completed and Paul's expertise was no longer needed Nigel and Raymond had Paul and Katherine murdered by Moon's hit team. Chad and Alex were supposed to die too so they could not come back and claim what's rightfully theirs what Nigel and Raymond stole from Paul which was his business and the tunnel. Alex reluctantly believes Frank about this story but Danielle continues to refuse to believe it. Alex Chad and Frank head out on Alex's boat. A few minutes after setting off Alex's boat is approached by another boat. Alex allows three Chinese men aboard to look over a couple of cars that are on Alex's boat. As this is going on two police boats approach. Alex throws the three Chinese men overboard then while Alex heads to the boat's steering wheel Chad and Frank send the cars overboard and blow the cars up. It seems that Alex is a smuggler. Later Frank Chad Alex and Danielle are at a restaurant where Alex tells Chad and Frank that Danielle has been an employee of Nigel's company for the past 5 years. That's why Danielle refuses to believe Nigel's part in Paul and Katherine's murders. Chad takes a taxi cab out to the hotel where he and Frank have been staying but before he can go inside he is approached by a group of Chinese men who think he's Alex. Moon forces Chad into a car with Raymond and taken to a boat yard.

"Dragonheart begins with Bowen (Dennis Quaid) a Knight of the ""Old Code"" of honor valor and chivalry tutoring his young protege Einon (Lee Oakes) in both swordplay and the values of a knight. Einon is the king's son and heir to the throne. The lesson conducted amongst the ruins of an old Roman fortress is interrupted by Brok (Brian Thompson) leader of the armies of King Freyne (Peter Hric). Brok tells Einon of a peasant rebellion and King Freyne wants Einon to witness it being crushed. Einon rushes to the village where the fighting is taking place forcing Bowen to follow to protect him. Einon thinks Bowen's blade will be the best on the battlefield but Bowen warns Einon to learn the difference between battle and butchery and only by doing so will he be a greater ruler than his father. Einon promises that he will be a greater ruler.(During the battle a caption says the movie takes place in England in the year 984 A.D.)Bowen is separated from Einon when the youth rushes off as his father who brazenly rode off alone to set fire to huts and homes is surrounded by peasants in an ambush. Freyne is dismounted and killed. When the villagers disperse Einon rushes from a hiding place and takes the crown off his father's head. Freyne who isn't quite dead yet grabs at Einon who struggles free yelling ""It's mine!"" In the confusion a young girl (Sandra Kovacicova) wearing a bucket on her head as a helmet falls off of the balcony of a smoking hut and knocks Einon into a spiked post which pierces through his chest grievously wounding him. The girl takes off her helm to reveal long red hair. They look at each other for a moment the girl remorseful and Einon with pain. Bowen rides in and grabs Einon rushing him to the castle. Royal physicians prepare to work on saving Einon who is crying in pain but Einon's mother Queen Aislinn (Julie Christie) orders them all out except for Bowen. As Aislinn examines her son's wound Bowen says Einon is beyond all help. Aislinn looks at a small statue of a dragon and says ""Not all.""Aislinn Bowen and a small company of soldiers go to a cave in the mountains where Aislinn calls to a being of reverence. To the shock of everyone else a dragon appears though most of him is hidden in shadow. When he sees the severity of Einon's wound he is reluctant to help and warns Aislinn the consequences of what must be done to save him. Aislinn assures the dragon that Einon is not like his father and vows to ensure that he grows up to be a fine leader and role model for his people but the dragon insists that Einon swear to all this himself. Einon swears by the dragon just as he breathes his last. Bowen angrily shouts at the dragon but is reprimanded as the dragon opens a chest plate and removes half his heart placing it in Einon's chest. He then seals the wound with a blast of fire. As Einon wakes up he commands the boy to do as he promised. Aislinn kneels before the dragon in gratitude and Bowen promises to repay the favor any way he can any time in the future when the dragon might need him. On the way back down the mountain Einon calls Brok to him and tells him that he will rebuild the Roman fortress as the new royal castle. Brok states that the task will take many men and Einon says ""Yes it will.""The rebellion is crushed and the peasants are all forced to provide hard labor to rebuild the castle. The rebel leader Redbeard (Terry O'Neill) and several of his best cohorts are brought before young Einon in chains. Einon decrees that their eyes should be burned out. Bowen interferes and breaks the restraints binding Redbeard and the peasant leaders allowing them to flee. Einon berates Bowen for interefering but Bowen protests Einon's cruelty towards his subjects reminding him of the Code. Einon replies that the king is above the Code. Angry Bowen tells Einon that the king is even more bound to the Code than anyone. Outraged at Einon's sudden cruel demeanor Bowen rushes to the dragon's cave shouting that the dragon's 'gift' corrupted Einon and that Bowen has decided on a new vow-- to spend the rest of his life hunting the dragon down to ultimately kill him.Twelve years later we encounter a traveling monk named Brother Gilbert (Pete Postlethwaite) spouting poetry and prose to himself to be written down. Suddenly he sees a dragon fly past with Bowen charging after it. He catches up to the dragon beyond the edge of a hill (we see grass earth and hay flying up). Brother Gilbert sighs in sorrow as he sees Bowen's horse run over the hill riderless until finally Bowen emerges victorious. Brother Gilbert praises Bowen on his bravery as a servant for King Einon Lord Felton (Jason Isaacs) arrives to give Bowen the kingdom's gratitude. But Bowen wants the gold he was apparently promised for killing the dragon insisting that despite his honor as a knight he still has to eat and upkeep his horse and gear. Lord Felton scoffs at Bowen as having become a rogue mercenary only interested in money.Meanwhile Redbeard now old blind and feeble is working in a quarry when his daughter Kara (Dina Meyer) comes to bring him some water. The cup is shot out of his hand by a now-adult King Einon (David Thewlis) accompanied by Brok and Felton. Kara begs that Einon show some mercy on her father and to release him. Einon agrees to do so-- and shoots Redbeard through the heart with an arrow. Einon exclaims that death is a release not a punishment. He rides off with Felton and Brok chuckling leaving Kara to grieve.Brother Gilbert follows Bowen seeking to write poetry about his deeds as a dragonslayer. Pausing to rest near a waterfall they discover that behind this waterfall is a cave housing another dragon (voiced by Sean Connery). Bowen moves forward through the falls to kill the dragon but it escapes and leads Bowen on a wild chase taunting him along the way. Soon they come to an empty field where they fight face-to-face. The dragon scoops Bowen into his mouth where Bowen stabs his sword against the dragon's palate. Both stuck they come to an impasse and remain that way for a number of hours. Brother Gilbert watching nearby and reciting more prose eventually falls asleep. After some arguing the dragon has had enough; he pushes Bowen out of his mouth and traps him under his claws. Instead of killing Bowen the dragon offers an alternative which would be beneficial for both of them.The next day we see the dragon flying over a village terrorizing the peasants. Bowen arrives and agrees to save the villagers for a price. He and the dragon stage a mock battle where Bowen appears to kill the dragon with a large spear projected from a ballista. The dragon feigns a hit and falls into the river where he stealthily swims away. They meet later Bowen counting his gold. He is satisfied with the new partnership but is wondering about his draconian partner who claims to now be the last of his kind. The dragon admits he does long to die but is frightened at the prospect of losing his soul.We see Einon and his retinue enjoying a nightly feast in the castle; Queen Aislinn sits morosely nearby alone and clearly distasteful at what Einon has become. As Einon lifts a silver flagon to drink in its reflection he sees a figure crouched high in a window directly behind him. He moves quickly just as Kara holding a knife and bent on killing Einon crashes down onto the table. The guards drag Kara off to the dungeon as she kicks and screams of how Einon murdered her father. Aislinn glares at Einon who takes the knife and stabs it angrily into a roasted boar.Some time later Einon goes down to the dungeon to see Kara. She is now grimy from the filth of the dungeon and long chains bolted into the wall are attached to heavy steel manacles around her wrists. Kara rushes at Einon only for the chains to stop her short. Einon recognizes the fire in Kara's eyes and looking at her fiery red hair realizes that Kara was the young girl who accidentally fell into him many years ago thus the one responsible for the wound that required the dragon's gift to heal him. He tells her that he is indebted to her for this.The scene switches to Bowen and the dragon at their camp Bowen has been calling the dragon simply 'dragon' and the dragon decides he's tired of it since he has a name. Bowen asks what it is though the dragon claims he couldn't possibly pronounce it. Still he obliges to answer but is cut off as his shoulder flares red and he falls back roaring in pain.The scene quickly switches to Einon's bedroom. He falls against a wall with a fresh wound on his shoulder (this implies the link between him and the dragon). Kara backs away from him holding a knife. They are both dressed in sleeping clothes. Einon mocks Kara to hit more flesh less cloth next time and forces her to his bed grabbing the knife away from her. He offers her the chance to be his bride an idea Kara finds repugnant. He leaves her in his room to think it over and walks away.Back at the camp Bowen places a blanket over the dragon's wound who explains that it is merely something the just pops up every now and then. The dragon closes his eyes to sleep and wakes up some time later to see Bowen still awake. Bowen says that he's been thinking of a name for the dragon and offers to call him Draco after the constellation. Although amused that the name only means 'dragon' in another tongue the dragon is honored.Later still Kara remains locked in Einon's bedroom alone looking to escape when a large stone in the floor suddenly slides aside and Aislinn appears. She tells Kara that she will lead her through a hidden tunnel so she can escape. Kara is grateful for the release but Aislinn is gone before Kara can properly thank her.Once free Kara goes to her home village looking to incite another rebellion against Einon. However the villagers remembering what happened last time want none of it and pelt her with rotten vegetables. One of the senior villagers Hewe (Wolf Christian) who aided Kara's father Redbeard in the previous rebellion and now without one of his eyes is incensed at Kara. Before she can argue further Draco appears and pretends to attack. Bowen arrives soon after offering to rid the village of the nuisance for a price. Kara berates Bowen as a blackmailer who is no different than Einon. Needing to get Kara out of the way Bowen slyly suggests that a maiden sacrifice to the dragon might get him to leave the people alone.The villagers waste no time tying Kara to a stake placed in a wagon for the dragon. Of course Draco finds the idea of a sacrifice distasteful and it turns out he is quite opposed to eating humans. In order to finish the scam Draco grabs Kara and flies off pretending to be appeased by the 'sacrifice.' When Bowen chases after Draco to see where he's gone to he finds him sitting at the waterfall where they first met singing pleasantly to Kara who sits on a rock nearby. No longer at all afraid Kara questions Draco's benign nature against his decision to attack her village. When Bowen arrives she waves a dagger in his face to defend Draco though she quickly realizes that they indeed work together.The scene is interrupted by Einon and a group of soldiers. Draco enters his cave escaping notice. Einon does not fail to notice however that Bowen is in company of Kara the woman he intends to marry. When Bowen tells Einon to leave them alone Einon challenges him to battle. Bowen's swordplay skills are as sharp as ever but Einon proves to be a match for him. Bowen berates Einon for betraying the code and the vows he spoke. Einon retorts that he lied; as far as he was concerned Bowen taught him to fight nothing more. Bowen's spirit is broken at the realization that Einon was always as treacherous and malevolent as his father and that all he wanted was the absolute power of the king's crown. His concentration lapses and Einon defeats him stabbing him in the chest. Einon pretends to leave Bowen merely wounded and when he turns back to throw a dagger at him Draco lunges forward menacingly and pulls back his chest plate revealing to a frightened Einon his half heart and an open target. Einon flees while Bowen angrily states that he had everything under control.Kara accompanies Bowen on the road trying to talk him into leading a rebellion against Einon but Bowen is too disillusioned to do so. Draco flies past him en route to another village that he and Bowen are planning to bilk out of its gold. At the village the elder is counting out gold when Kara disgusted at the scam arrives to proclaim Bowen a fraud. But Brother Gilbert arrives to defend him as a great dragonslayer. Kara knows that Bowen and Draco are working together but of course her claim is met with uproarious laughter and ridicule Bowen laughing with the villagers to cover himself.Bowen and Draco carry out the routine with Kara and Brother Gilbert watching but the scam goes wrong when the river Draco lands in after pretending to be killed is too shallow for him to swim away unseen. The villagers advance intending to cut Draco up for meat to feed themselves. To save himself Draco flies off proving the scam. The villagers decide they will cut up and eat Bowen Kara and Brother Gilbert instead. As they sit on Bowen's horse surrounded Draco grabs them and flies them all to Avalon the legendary resting place of King Arthur.At Avalon Draco tells the tale of how dragons must earn entry into their equivalent of heaven and those who fail fade into oblivion. Draco is frightened that this fate now awaits him because of a sacrifice he made long ago that proved malevolent despite his best intentions. He is the dragon that gave Einon half his heart and he did so knowing that Einon would betray all the vows he made. Desperate to redeem himself he offers to return to the villages with Kara and help her start a new rebellion. Despondent and having lost faith in the Old Code Bowen refuses. Later on during a rainstorm Bowen is brought out to a large courtyard surrounded by statues of kings past by the voice of Draco muttering an old tenant. Bowen then sees a vision at the statue of King Arthur who recites the creed of the Old Code. Bowen repeats the words and is filled with a new sense of purpose reminded of all that he once swore himself to. Draco appears smiling and shields Bowen from the rain with one of his wings.Back at Kara's home village Bowen tells the people that he is starting a war against Einon and when they see that he has the support of a dragon they are all moved to rebellion. The men are trained by Bowen to fight and even Brother Gilbert proves to be a master archer.Brok happens to ride by the village and finds the people fletching arrows and smithing whatever weapons of war they can; practicing combat and adapting farm tools to be used as weapons. He sees Draco in the village hears him roar and rushes off to inform Einon.Lord Felton smugly dismisses the revolt but Einon warns him that he will not underestimate either Bowen or the dragon. Einon knows Bowen too well and takes the threat very seriously. Aislinn comes to Einon and presents him with a gift... a team of five of the finest dragonslayers in the land.When Bowen feels the villagers are ready he leads the forces to Einon's castle. Einon is suited up in chain-mail armor and eager for battle. Felton and Brok try to stop him from rushing out arguing that the castle is impregnable and the villagers will soon give up... but Draco begins assaulting the castle from the air taking out many of its defenses and easily outwitting the dragonslayers.Einon leads his men out to meet Bowen. Looking to crush Bowen he signals a charge. Bowen signals a retreat and the villagers lead Einon's men into the woods where suddenly the villagers turn to face the soldiers and more villagers come out of hiding showing their numbers to be far greater than was thought. Numerous traps are set up through the forest and Brother Gilbert hides in the trees with fellow archers though hesitant to kill. He soon devises clever ways to distract and wound the soldiers. Bowen fights on horseback with his sword while Kara leads the footsoldiers battling with twin hand axes and slaying several soldiers in her own right.Seeing his soldiers losing the battle Einon signals a retreat turning and fleeing for the castle. Several villagers try to stop him but Einon dispatches them easily. Bowen yells for Brother Gilbert to stop Einon. Brother Gilbert struggles with the Commandment ""Thou shalt not kill"" before finally releasing an arrow right into Einon's heart. No sooner does the arrow strike when Draco drops from the sky like a stone with a harsh cry. Bowen freezes in his tracks stricken with horror watching Einon slowly pull the arrow out of his chest in bewilderment. Suddenly Einon spurs his horse and races to the castle where the dragonslayers have chained Draco down with a web of steel chains. Einon reaches them and orders them not to kill Draco... he wants him alive and safe...""for all eternity."" Draco moans ""Oh... no.""Bowen goes to the castle to save Draco with Kara and Brother Gilbert. Kara starts to lead them through the secret passage she was led through by Aislinn and Hewe and the peasant soldiers meet up with them saying they need to open a gate so the other villagers can enter. Bowen emerges with Kara and Brother Gilbert inside the castle in Einon's room where they find Einon waiting for them. Bowen and Einon battle through the underground sewers and back to the castle.Hewe and the peasant soldiers kill several guards through the gate and open it. Felton is looking to escape and sees Kara approaching. Hiding he grabs her from behind looking to use her as a hostage to escape but Hewe stabs him in the back and kills him.Running through the castle Kara is ambushed by Brok but he is too overconfident and he leaves himself wide open for a killing strike from a two-handed battle axe Kara grabs. He dies in astonishment saying ""a girl"" several times.In the courtyard where Draco is being held and guarded we see a silhouetted figure approach a soldier who bows to the silhouette before being stabbed dead with a knife. Draco recognizes Aislinn and calls her forth. Aislinn kneels before Draco who knows that she is here for only one reason. Aislinn picks up a long spear and prepares to stab Draco with it but Einon stops her. The hit he took from the arrow helped Einon figure out that his life is tied to Draco's and that as long as Draco lives Einon is virtually immortal...but if Draco was killed Einon would die as well. Aislinn explains that she made a mistake years ago when she ""saved a creature not worth saving."" Einon angry and disappointed at his mother's betrayal merely says ""How unmotherly of you."" Draco strains against his chains growling as Aislinn turns away from Einon and walks off. Einon follows her into the shadows carrying the spear and we hear Aislinn cry out.Einon comes across Bowen and they battle their way up onto the parapets as Kara watches. Einon breaks Bowen's sword. As Bowen swings away from Einon on a pulley Einon loses his balance and plunges off the parapet breaking through a wooden walkway into the bottom of the castle. Bowen reaches Draco and starts to unchain him and Draco reveals the final piece of the puzzle... through the shared heart he and Einon share each other's physical pain but Draco's half holds the life force and he must die in order to vanquish Einon. Bowen has come to respect and admire Draco too much and cannot bring himself to kill his friend. But Einon appears bloody but alive grabbing Kara from behind and putting his sword to her neck. Draco bites hard on his own hand and Einon feels the pain and is forced to drop his sword. Kara pulls away from him and Einon draws a dagger and rushes at Bowen. In a tense moment Bown seems unsure until Draco gives him a reassuring smile pulling back his chest plate. Bowen hurls Kara's axe into Draco's heart. Einon gasps and collapses in shock as Draco smiles at Bowen one last time before peacefully dying.Kara Brother Gilbert and the victorious villagers gather around the body of Draco where Bowen is mourning his passing not knowing who or where to turn to for inspiration. Then he hears Draco's voice telling him to look to the stars. Draco's body dissipates into a rolling ball of reddish light that slowly ascends into the skies heading toward the constellation that Bowen named him after. The other stars gather around Draco's soul-- the collective of dragons welcoming the last of their kind home. Bowen smiles as he sees that Draco has redeemed himself and gained entry into his heaven.The movie closes with a voiceover from Brother Gilbert recounting that Bowen and Kara led the people of the kingdom through a golden age of wisdom justice and brotherhood for many years and that Draco's star always shone down on them as a source of inspiration and strength whenever they needed him."

Shortly after the race begins Natasha receives a phone call from Carlo notifying her that he has rescued her mother. Infamous and Cheng are eliminated from the race after their cars (an SLR and a Porsche Carrera GT respectively) are involved in separate crashes. Natasha and Brechen are still on the race. As both cars reach the finish line Natasha (driving Michael's Enzo Ferrari) is several car lengths ahead of Brecken's Saleen S7. The good news that Carlo told her on the phone earlier prompts her to slam the brakes hard stopping the Enzo inches away from the finish line and giving the S7 the win.With no money left Michael is given a last ride from the crime organization he owes money to. As a way of thanking Natasha for handing his driver the victory Brecken gives her a recording contract (which shortly lands her on the cover of Variety) an Enzo and a Koenigsegg CCX. The film ends with Natasha (in the Koenigsegg) and Carlo (in the Enzo) racing each other before being chased by the police on the freeway."

"The narrator reads a long boring story about the existence of an ancient Native American civilization which disappeared for unknown reasons.Present Day. Edward Carnby (Christian Slater) is on board an airplane and has a nightmare in which he remembers how he hid himself in a high-voltage box as a child while staring at some alien-like creatures.As an adult (explaining in a voice-over narration) Edward looks for remains of an extinct Indian tribe the Abkani which disappeared suddenly 10000 years ago for reasons unexplained. He's found a trinket piece of something related to it. On his way to the museum where Aline Cedrac (Tara Reid) an assistant curator and Edward's ex-girlfriend works and is scanning some more Abkani pieces he is attacked by somebody with supernatural abilities named James Pinkerton (Ed Anders) who tries to steal the artifact that he has but Edward fights him off.At the same time Professor Lionel Hudgens (Matthew Walker) almost doesn't make it alive from a sea voyage where he finds the ""edegus"" or something like that. The ship's crew finds a coffin made of gold from the ocean floor. After they dock the evil and greedy captain of the salvage tug locks up Hudgens and his men open the gold coffin... even though Hudgens asks them not to do so. Five minutes afterwards they are all dead but for Hudgens imprisoned inside a storage room on the ship. Hudgens slips away ashore after collecting another item from the empty gold coffin which apparently contained a mysterious creature.Upon the opening of the gold coffin an old friend of Edward disappears into the night. Several other people across the USA and Canada walk off in a trance as if being drawn by some beacon. Edward hears a ear-splitting screech while in his apartment looking over the Abkani artifact. At the same time in an underground military facility called Research Agency Bureau 713 the location of the opening of the gold coffin is relayed by the control room techs who report it to their bureau chief by the evidence of the electro-magnetic wave that appears on their monitors.Edward a paranormal investigator and former agent of Bureau 713 thinks it's related to the Abkani. The old friend was a fellow orphan from when Hudgens convinced Sister Clara (Karin Konoval) to run some experiments on the children without anybody's consent (shown in another flashback). Edward investigates.Edward arrives that same evening at the Natural History Museum where he is reunited with a not-so-happy Aline with the artifact and she shows him another Abkani artifact that recently arrived and she has been working on it since Professor Hudgens is away. Just then the mysterious creature from the ship attacks them inside the museum killing a security guard but Edward and Aline hide in a storage closet long enough for troopers from Bureau 713 to arrive and the creature (which is a four-legged fast-moving beast resembling a cross between a panther and the creatures of 'Aliens') retreats into the night.Commander Richard Burke (Stephen Dorff) the team leader of the Bureau 713 strike force arrives where Edward tries to relay information to him that something big is going down but Burke rebukes him saying that since he no longer works for Bureau 713 to stay out of their investigation.The next day Edward tries to get information from his former co-workers at Bureau 713 one of whom is staff surgeon and pathologist Sam Fischer (Frank C. Turner) to learn more about the creature encountered as well as the history of the Abkani.At the same time Professor Hudges arrives back at the museum where he goes to his office where he has a captured creature (whether this is the same creature from the ship or a different one is never fully explained). Hudgens uses a syringe to draw fluid from the captive creature to study it as part of his further research to combine the DNA of man and beast.Edward continues investigating his past by going to his former orphanage to learn more about Hudges research and then back to his apartment where Aline is and they consumate their attraction to each other.While the Bureau 713 soldiers are patroling the museum they are attacked by several creatures who are the missing people that wondered off upon the opening of the gold coffin containing the creature. During the firefight several soldiers and most of the human-creatures are killed. Edward arrives on the scene and talks more with Burke who again tells him away. However during a scuffle Edward picks Burke's pocket containing his Bureau 713 security badge.The next morning Edward goes to Bureau 713 where he talks with Fischer in the morgue looking at one of the dead bodies where Fischer shows Edward a small cenntipede-like baby creature in the dorsal spine of his old friend Pinkeron. Fischer also discovers that Edward has one of his own in his body but it is dead presumably because of the contact with the electro-shock while Edward was a child. Fischer tells him that he could take the creature out but leaving him disabled. As the monster looks dead it's not an urgent matter. Burke and his men arrive and escort Edward out of the morgue and the building.That evening Professor Hudges ambushes Fischer as he arrives home to find his wife dead. Hudges inserts a baby creature into Fischer's mouth thereby putting him under his control.Edward discovers that the Abkani had fought those creatures which can get killed by light (that's why they always move around on dark places). They also disrupt electrical light creating blackouts. The Abkani artifacts found all over the world actually open the gate to another dimension where millions of those creatures are sleeping waiting to be freed and kill humans. Hudgens is making further experiments with the creature he's captured somehow when he takes some of the creature's blood and injects it into his veins. That way he becomes a semi-alien being and can control the monsters.At the climax Aline Edward Burke and the latter's military squad go to Edward's orphanage where there are strong electro-magnetic disruptions. They are attacked by dozens of these reptilian-like monsters and there is a climactic and violent 20-minute fight where almost all creatures and humans kill one another. Edward Burke and Aline reach the old surgery room underground where the baby creature was transplanted into Edward. There Hudgens takes Edward's piece of archeological remains and opens the gate. Millions of creatures start to wake up and run down a huge cave. They go down the walls but they don't approach the gate for some reason giving time for the three good characters to kill Hudgens run away only to realize that they can't detonate the bomb from such a long distance. Burke comes back and blows everything up... himself along with the creatures.Edward and Aline rise to the surface at the back of the orphanage at dawn only to find an evacuated city without people cars abandoned on the streets. They walk down the street but several noises are heard. The last shot shows them in the middle of an empty road turning around suddenly supposedly to confront one of the creatures.... regardless of it being day.Aren't the monsters hurt by light? Because the gate hasn't been closed properly the door has been left open for a second installment. (No please!)"

"For five years Superman (Brandon Routh) has been away from Earth coaxed into space by a belief that Krypton may still exist. In the time he's been away the world has changed--not only has terrorism become rampant but Lois Lane has been living with Perry White's nephew started a family and won a Pulitzer Prize for her piece ""Why the World Doesn't Need Superman.""Also during this time Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) has conned a wealthy widow named Gertrude Vanderworth (Noel Neill) out of her fortune with the assumption that he has changed his ways after being in prison. After inheriting her money Lex his assistant Kitty Kowalski (Parker Posey) and some henchmen take Gertrude's private yacht and head North toward Superman's Fortress of Solitude. Lex carefully guides them to the location where he finds several crystals and the holographic image of Superman's father Jor-El (Marlon Brando). After listening to the hologram Lex and his crew take the crystals and return to Metropolis.Meanwhile Superman returns to Earth landing near the Kent Farm in Kansas where his mother Martha Kent (Eva Marie Saint) currently resides. After spending some time with her Superman re-adopts his Clark Kent persona and returns to Metropolis. Reporter Jimmy Olsen (Sam Huntington) and Daily Planet Editor Perry White (Frank Langella) are there to greet Clark. However his reunion with Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) is put on hold as she is aboard a jetliner being used to launch a new shuttle into space. However the shuttle fails to disengage before it's engines fire and rocket the jetliner in orbit the flames from the shuttle's engines burning the plane's tail section.Superman flies into action and manages to disengage the shuttle but the jet ends up plummeting to Earth with it's tail section burned up. Chasing it into the Earth's atmosphere Superman manages to stop the jet before it crashes into a baseball stadium filled with people as a game is underway. After greeting the press and the public in the cheering stands Superman takes off.Unknown to Superman and the rest of the public the shuttle's error was due to a brief power outage that affected much of the country. This was caused by Lex Luthor who after taking a sliver from a crystal placed it into some water in a model train layout in the basement of Gertrude Vanderworth's mansion. This triggered an EMP (electromagnetic pulse) reaction that cut off local power but resulted in a large crystal growth to blossom from the sliver that ends up demolishing the model and growing up through the basement.Back at the Daily Planet Lois wants to find out more about the power outage but Perry White wants the entire staff to focus on getting as much information on Superman as possible. It is during this time that Clark reintroduces himself to Lois and meets her long-term fiance Richard White (James Marsden) and their child Jason (Tristan Lake Leabu). After their encounter Superman later meets Lois on the roof where they have a heart-to-heart talk and Lois explains to him that she has moved on.Trying to distance himself from his emotions over Lois Superman returns to fighting crime not just in Metropolis but all over the world. In one instance he rescues Kitty Kowalski when the brakes fail on her Ford Mustang. However this was all a ruse to keep Superman occupied as Lex and some associates break into the Metropolis Museum to steal some Kryptonite. Shortly afterward Superman returns to the Fortress of Solitude where he finds the crystals containing the information regarding Krypton are now missing.Lois continues to investigate the power outage which leads her to the Vanderworth mansion with her son in tow. Finding the mansion locked she finds the Vanderworth yacht floating nearby and goes aboard. Before she can react the yacht has pulled away and Lois finds herself face-to-face with Lex Luthor.While aboard the yacht Luthor begins to explain his plan to Lois. Using the crystals that he took from Superman's Fortress of Solitude he intends to sink them into the ocean creating brand new continents with enough land mass to overtake the Americas Europe and Africa and cause the oceans to rise burying much of the present land mass killing billions of people. With Luthor having a monopoly on land he intends to charge exorbitant prices for people to live on his new continents.Lex then leaves Lois and her son under the watchful eye of one of his henchmen before going to the main deck of the ship. One of the crystals is inserted inside a tube made of Kryptonite and placed inside a stolen Russian missile. As it is fired into the ocean it creates a reaction that starts the growth of a new landmass albeit riddled with Kryptonite.Lois tries to distract their captor and attempts to send a fax with their coordinates to the Daily Planet but not before she's found out. However before their captor can kill her a piano flies across the room crushing him. It appears to have been thrown by Lois' son...who it appears was actually fathered by Superman. When Lex hears of this he has Lois and her son locked in the ship's pantry before the rest of them take off in a helicopter on deck to the newly-grown continent.Back at the Daily Planet the fax has partially come through and Richard heads off to find Lois. Superman attempts to follow but becomes side-tracked when the newly-growing landmass causes a tremor that threatens the entire city. Superman has his hands full saving people and averting catastrophes. Once it seems the tremors have stopped he heads back out to sea. At the exact coordinates he finds Richard's seaplane but also the Vanderworth Yacht skewered by a spiky growth from the new continent. Superman rescues Richard Lois and Jason before the Yacht cleaves in two and disappears below the water.As the family takes off Superman heads to the 'New Krypton' continent to confront Luthor. Luthor greets Superman who with the environment teeming with Kryptonite has grown weaker. Luthor and his thugs beat and pummel Superman before Luthor stabs him with a Kryptonite shard and sends him plummeting off a cliff to the waters below.Superman is saved when Lois convinces Richard to go back telling him of how the new continent is laced with Kryptonite. After Jason spots Superman in the ocean Lois dives in and manages to catch hold of Superman's cape and haul him to the surface while Richard gets him aboard the plane. Lois pulls out the Kryptonite shard but is unable to remove it all. Regaining consciousness Superman thanks them for the rescue but decides to go back to stop Lex. Superman first breaks through the clouds above to absorb as much energy as he can from the Earth's sun. Flying down he burrows below the new landmass and then lifts it out of the water shielding himself from the kryptonite underneath with as much rock and soil as he can.Lex Kitty and their henchmen attempt to flee the ascending continent but all the henchmen are crushed by a massive chunk of falling edifice. Lex Kitty and her dog manage to board the helicopter. Kitty who is tinged with guilt about the how many are going to die if the other continents get created throws out the other crystals. With no time to retrieve them Lex pilots the helicopter away. Superman growing weaker and weaker due to the Kryptonite-laced continent manages to push it into space before plummeting to Earth crashing into a park in Metropolis.Superman is rushed to a hospital where the remaining Kryptonite shard is removed and the doctors attempt to revive him (spoiling several pieces of medical equipment in the process as they try to resuscitate him). However after several days he has not regained consciousness. A vigil is held outside the hospital by hundreds of people and even Martha Kent is among them. Back at the Daily Planet Perry White has two front pages ready to run: ""Superman Is Dead"" and ""Superman Lives."" Richard generously offers to drive Lois to the hospital and Lois and Jason manage to get in and see Superman though he does not wake. While Lois leans over the unconscious Superman she whispers something softly in his ear with a meaningful glance at Jason; we are led to think that she has told Superman that he has a son. Jason is entranced by Superman's costume lying on a chair and as they leave Jason dashes to Superman's bedside and gives him a brief kiss goodbye. As Lois and Jason are escorted from the hospital Martha spots them and gazes speculatively at Jason. We see Lex and Kitty stranded on a small desert island with no food or water. When Kitty wonders aloud what are they going to eat Lex eyes Kitty's little dog that she's cradling. Shortly afterwards as a nurse checks on the room the bed is found to be empty the window open and the costume gone.Later that evening Superman flies to Lois and Richard's house. Lois is at her desk tearfully attempting to start writing another article: ""Why The World Needs Superman."" Superman slips into the house to gaze at Jason who is asleep. Superman repeats the same words his father spoke to him so many years before: ""You'll be different. Sometimes you'll feel like an outcast. But you'll never be alone. You'll make my strength your own. You'll see my life through your eyes and your life will be seen through mine."" Gently he caresses Jason's head and finishes softly ""The son becomes the father and the father becomes the son."" Just before he leaves Lois who is outside suddenly hears Jason piping ""Goodbye!"" and sees Superman leaving. She asks him if they will see him again and before he flies away he assures her that he will always be around.With that farewell for now Superman takes off and ascends to a high altitude for another patrol of his home a world that knows that he has truly returned."

The film opens with a brutal scene of a restrained woman giving birth; she is then killed by a mutant (Papa Hades). There follows a synopsis of the previous movie explaining that electronic surveillance was ordered installed in the New Mexico military base. The scientists are then shown working on the electronic surveillance installation and encountering problems with rats chewing the insulation on their power cables. Some 'false' readings are seen before the system fails. The antagonists are introduced at this point and the scientists and their colonels are depicted meeting various untimely and gruesome ends.Next the film cuts to an apparent military operation in Kandahar Afghanistan in which the troops are depicted as not being cohesive as a group and show individual weaknesses. The operation ends when a 'civilian' woman approaches the group and reveals multiple grenades under her garment at this point the operation is revealed to be a training exercise for rookie troops on US soil. The sergeant lambastes the troops for their failure then tells them they are going on a mission to bring supplies to scientists working on a surveillance system in a top secret area. By this time many of the troops have their individual characters established namely that Napoleon is actually anti-war and that Crank is particularly gung-ho and violent.On arriving at the secret base there is no sign of the scientists. A garbled radio message is received followed by a mirror signal from atop a hill. The sergeant orders a search and rescue mission leaving behind Napoleon as punishment for questioning this order and Amber to monitor the radio. As they are climbing Mickey falls into an old mine shaft twisting his ankle in the process but is pulled out by the sergeant who orders him to go back to base. Napoleon and Amber discover a man one of the missing scientists trying to escape from the chemical latrine who then dies from mass infection after warning them of danger. Soon after they discover their transport vehicle in flames and their rifles missing. Amber starts up the hill towards the others but is attacked by one of the mutants Stabber. Mickey is returning down the hill and shoots Stabber who then disappears down a hole in the shoulder from long range. Mickey gets a bit closer to Amber before a hand appears from underground and drags him gruesomely down the hole. Napoleon and Amber retrieve his weapon and set off to join the others who by now have scaled a cliff and set up a rope after discovering a second body of a scientist.Just as Amber and Napoleon join the main group they come under attack from another mutant and Spitter accidentally shoots the sergeant dead. They decide to turn back and Spitter volunteers to carry the sergeant's body down the rope abseil since he feels responsible for his death. On the way down they fall and it is revealed the rope has been cut. Having no other way down the group attempts to find a way down on foot. They find a dead scientist and meet the mortally wounded colonel who explains briefly their enemy including the fact that the mutants keep the female victims alive in order to breed new mutants (in reference to the opening scene) and the fact that they can only get down through the mines before committing suicide with a pistol.A trap is laid with the two female soldiers which succeeds in luring out one of the mutants who is shot dead. In a brief moment of victory however Missy is abducted by another mutant who is camouflaged against the rocks. The group give chase into the mines but Stump won't follow and decides to climb alone down the cliff and bring help. The others continue under the leadership of Delmar onwards and downwards through corrugated iron tunnels and mine shafts. Napoleon and Amber become separated after falling through a hidden shaft. Meanwhile Stump who has been climbing down the mountain is attacked and killed by the mutant Letch.The captive Missy is carried to a room with makeshift furniture where her captor Chameleon attempts to rape her. She fends him off by biting off part of his elongated tongue. Just as she flees however Missy is confronted by the large and menacing Papa Hades. Hades drives Chameleon away before subjecting Missy to brutal physical assault and rape hoping to impregnate her as a result.Meanwhile the fleeing Chameleon meets and attacks Napoleon and Amber who manage to kill him using a large rock. An extremely near-sighted mutant Grabber armed with one of the missing rifles detects Chameleon's corpse. Amber and Napoleon retreat down a shaft into the lair of an apparently passive mutant Hansel. The remaining National Guard troops (Delmar and Crank) approach and Delmar is shot by Grabber who is then killed by Crank who empties his magazine. Delmar claims it's only a shoulder wound and caries on. Napoleon appears and shows them the secret passage and Hansel who wants them to follow him and they do. They pass through a macabre room where the previous victims bodies and possessions appear to have been stockpiled. A frying pan is seen containing severed fingers. Severed legs hang from meat hooks. Amber finds the mutilated body of Mickey. Delmar breaks down spitting blood and dies from wounds that are revealed to be more than superficial. They carry his body onwards. Hansel leads them out to blast door section at the edge of the mines however Amber insists that they go back for Missy. As Amber persuades Napoleon to accompany her Crank finds a stash of dynamite however on removing it he triggers the detonation switch and a large explosion ensues killing him and alerting Papa Hades.Amber and Napoleon manage to kill Letch who is hiding amongst some World War 2 mannequins using knives and bayonets. They then find the room containing the captive Missy. After distracting Hades with Missy's cell phone Amber and Napoleon manage to free Missy. Hades returns and a frantic fight ensues. Amber finds a single bullet and shoots Hades in the head but he continues to fight despite brain matter exuding from his skull. Enraged Missy beats Hades severely with a sledge hammer leaving his testicles smashed. Eventually the soldiers prevail and leave the body of Hades with a bayoneted rifle in his mouth.The three survivors stumble towards a light in the background and finds it as the exit of the mines. Text appears on-screen stating that none of the guardsmen were ever found are currently listed as AWOL and that military officials refuse to acknowledge that Sector 16 even exists. The image turns into a thermal visual and is being viewed by someone in a thermal monitor. A mutated hand slams on the monitor and the film ends.(Source: Wikipedia)

"In 1845 in North-Western Territory British North America young James Howlett (Troye Sivan) sees his father John Howlett (Peter O'Brien) killed by his friend Victor Creed's father Thomas Logan (Aaron Jeffery). In an act of vengeance James kills the elder Logan using bone claws which have grown out of his hands due to the stress of the incident. With his dying breath Logan tells James that he is also his son. James runs out of the house followed by Victor who finds him and promises his younger brother that he'll look out for him. James and Victor (Michael-James Olsen) run away pursued by a torch-wielding mob.In the years that follow adult brothers James (Hugh Jackman) and Victor (Liev Schreiber) are seen fighting together in the American Civil War World War I World War II and eventually the Vietnam War. Their regenerative powers keep them from being killed in the battlefield and they both age considerably slowly compared to non-mutants. James is forced to act as a check on Victor's increasing rage and ferocity. In Vietnam Victor kills a superior officer after being stopped from raping a girl and James and Victor are sentenced to death by firing squad though their unique regenerative abilities keep them alive.While they are incarcerated Major William Stryker (Danny Huston) approaches the two mutants and offers them membership in Team X his elite group of mutants. The team consists of mutants Fred Dukes (Kevin Durand) who possesses super strength and invulnerability; John Wraith (Will.i.am) who can teleport; Chris Bradley (Dominic Monaghan) a.k.a. Bolt who can control electricity and possesses telekinetic abilities; expert marksman Agent Zero (Daniel Henney); and mercenary Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) an amazing swordsman who never stops talking. The brothers join the group and are sent to the team's first mission: Invade the headquarters of a diamond trafficking operation in Lagos Nigeria to retrieve a meteorite. When Stryker asks the diamond smuggler about the source of the meteorite the smuggler tells him that it came from a remote village further into Nigeria. The team goes there and Stryker and the team brutally interrogate the local people to learn where the meteorite was found. James is disgusted by the murders committed by his teammates and abandons the group over Victor's persuasions and protests. Six years afterward James -- now going by his last name Logan -- is a lumberjack living with his girlfriend Kayla Silverfox (Lynn Collins). Meanwhile Victor hunts down and murders Bradley who works at a circus; Victor mentions that Wade is already dead. Stryker locates Logan and claims that someone is killing members of the now-disbanded team. Stryker asks Logan for help but is refused. Shortly after Silverfox is murdered by Victor. Wolverine hunts down his half-brother but is easily defeated. Stryker once again asks Logan for help and Logan agrees. Stryker has Logan's skeletal system reinforced with adamantium a virtually indestructible metal retrieved from the meteorite source found by Team X in Nigeria. Before the procedure Logan asks for his new dog tags to say ""Wolverine"" a reference to a story that Kayla told him. After the procedure Stryker orders Wolverine's memory to be erased but Wolverine overhears this and flees. Stryker orders Agent Zero to hunt him down and take his head off.An elderly couple Travis (Max Cullen) and Heather Hudson (Julia Blake) see Wolverine -- who escaped in the buff -- enter their barn. They're wary but welcoming giving him food and clothing including a leather jacket of their son's -- and their son's motorcycle. The next morning both are shot dead by Zero. Wolverine takes out several HMMWVs a helicopter and Zero himself telling Stryker over Zero's radio that he'll hunt him down. Stryker warns Wolverine that if he chooses to go after the answers he seeks he won't like what he finds. Wolverine locates former associates John Wraith and Fred Dukes (who is now massively obese from a guilt-driven eating disorder) seeking to learn the location of Stryker's new laboratory. After beating Dukes in a boxing match Wolverine learns the disbanded team had been capturing young mutants for Stryker. One of them Remy LeBeau (Taylor Kitsch) also known as Gambit escaped the island laboratory and knows its location. Dukes tells Logan that his brother Victor is actually working for Stryker capturing and killing mutants for him. Meanwhile Stryker captures a teenaged Scott Summers (Tim Pocock) with Victor's aid.Wolverine and Wraith locate Gambit in a New Orleans bar. Wolverine talks to Gambit while Wraith keeps watch outside but Gambit suspects Wolverine was sent to recapture him and using his ability to charge objects with kinetic energy throws several playing cards at Wolverine that send him flying through a wall. Outside Wolverine sees Victor has killed Wraith and taken a sample of his blood. Wolverine fights Victor only to be interrupted by Gambit. Victor escapes and after a brief struggle Gambit agrees to take Wolverine to the Stryker's secret mutant prison/laboratory. The facility turns out to be Three Mile Island. Once there Wolverine confronts Stryker and learns Silverfox is still alive; Victor faked her death with hydrochlorothiazide. She was keeping track of the mutant to free her sister Emma Frost (Tahyna MacManus) who is also in the prison. Wolverine is devastated by this betrayal.Now having no quarrel with Stryker Wolverine departs. Victor angered that Stryker let Wolverine go demands the adamantium procedure. Stryker however tells him that he won't survive the procedure and in an act of rage Victor tries to kill Silverfox her power of persuasion failing to influence Victor despite her physical contact with him. Wolverine hears Silverfox's screams and attacks Victor. Finally having the chance to kill Victor Wolverine chooses not to give in to his animal instincts and instead knocks him out. Silverfox shows Wolverine to the holding cells and he frees the mutants there; among them are Emma Frost and Scott Summers.Panicking Stryker prematurely activates his newest creation Weapon XI (Scott Adkins and Ryan Reynolds) a bald pale-skinned and deformed Wade Wilson lacking a mouth and with patterns on his skin marking his adamantium bone structure. As the rescue party approaches an exit it is blocked by Weapon XI who is under Stryker's control. Wolverine tells them to find a new exit as two long blades extend from Weapon XI's arms. The blades are similar to Wolverine's claws but more like katana swords Wilson's weapon of choice. Wolverine realizes that this monstrosity is actually Wade Wilson. ""Looks like Stryker finally found a way to shut you up"" he quips.Weapon XI also called Deadpool is a mutant Frankenstein's monster with the abilities of several of the killed and captured mutants: Summer's optic blasts Wraith's teleportation and Wolverine's healing ability. During the escape Silverfox is mortally wounded. The other mutants escape through the facility's tunnels guided by Scott who is unable to tell them how he knows the way out. Emerging from the tunnel the party encounters a helicopter. Riding in the helicopter is a familiar figure: Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) who has guided them to safety and offers them a home at his school.Meanwhile the fight between Wolverine and Weapon XI moves to the top of one of the nuclear power plant's cooling towers. Weapon XI overpowers and prepares to decapitate Wolverine but Victor returns to aid his brother. Wolverine and Victor now working together are able to decapitate Weapon XI sending its head still firing optic blasts down into the cooling tower. Wolverine coldly informs Victor that despite his help their relationship is over. Victor reminds him that as brothers they can never be finished and jumps off the the cooling tower. The damage from the optic blasts causes the cooling tower to collapse but Wolverine is rescued by Gambit.Wolverine asks Gambit to ensure the prisoners are safe while he returns to find Silverfox who stayed behind because she was wounded. As he carries her to safety Stryker shoots him in the back with an adamantium bullet. Wolverine charges Stryker to kill him but is shot in the head knocking him unconscious.Stryker approaches Silverfox and prepares to shoot her as well but she uses her powers of persuasion to order Stryker to first throw away the pistol and then walk away until his feet bleed. She then dies from her injuries. Gambit returns to assure Wolverine that the mutants are safe but due to amnesia caused by the brain damage the adamantium bullets inflicted Wolverine does not remember anything (this was Stryker's intention knowing that even the adamantium bullets could not kill Logan but will cause amnesia). Gambit tries to get Wolverine to come with him but he declines. Gambit wishes Wolverine good luck before departing and Wolverine flees the scene as the ambulances and police arrive.The film has several additional scenes during and after the credits. The first of these scenes plays a few seconds into the credits and depicts William Stryker walking down a road. Due to Silverfox's order the toes of his shoes are torn and bloody from walking for so long. A military vehicle drives up behind him and he is apprehended by military police for questioning about the death of General Munson. (Stryker murdered the general earlier in the film in order to protect his vendetta against mutants.)Depending on which theater the movie was shown in one of two possible endings then appears following the credits. In the first ending Weapon XI's hand reaches out from the rubble of the nuclear complex to touch his severed head. Deadpool's mouth is now open and he says ""Shhhhhhhh"" to the audience. The second alternate ending shows Logan drinking at a bar in Japan. The bartender asks if he is drinking to forget; Logan replies that he's drinking to remember."

In 2000 an American military pathologist is commanding a reluctant Korean assistant to violate protocol by dumping over 200 bottles of formaldehyde down the drain leading into the Han River. Over the next few years there are sightings of a strange amphibious creature in the water ways.Six years later in Seoul Park Gang-du (Song Kang-ho) has fallen asleep while working at small snack-bar. His father Hee-bong (Byeon Hee-bong) chases them away. Gang-du wakes up thinking he heard the voice of his daughter Hyun-seo (Go Ah-sung) but it was a different little girl. Hee-bong gives Gang-du an order to deliver to some customers but Gang-du eats part of his customers' food. Also with him is his brother and sister; national medalist archer Nam-joo (Bae Doona) and alcoholic former-activist Nam-il (Park Hae-il).While Gang-du is delivering food to some customers he sees a crowd along the Han River. They witness a huge creature hanging from the Wonhyo Bridge which then jumps into the water. At first it seems as though the creature has swam away encouraging the public to bait it back with food. Moments later the creature rises out of the river and runs amok. After the creature causes chaos and kills a number of people Gang-du and an American man attempt to kill the creature with a metal pole but in the process the American is seriously injured and they only succeed to anger it and starts pursuing Gang-du. Gang-du grabs a girl's hand which he believes to be Hyun-seo and starts to flee. When he realizes he isn't holding Hyun-seo he turns to see the creature running towards her. The creature then snatches Hyun-seo and dives back into the river.During a mass funeral for the victims of the creature (including Hyun-seo believed dead by her family) Government representatives arrive and forcefully quarantine all those who have been in direct contact with the creature including Gang-du and his family. The South Korean government announces that the creature is not only a direct danger but also the host of a deadly unknown virus (which is the formaldehyde from the drain) as the American (who lost an arm to the creature) is discovered to be infected with it.While in quarantine inside a hospital Gang-du receives a phone call from Hyun-seo who is not dead but trapped somewhere in the sewers by the creature. She is cut off as her phone battery runs out. Gang-du tries to explain this to others but his protests go ignored by all except his family. All four of them then decide to escape the hospital to track down Hyun-seo. Hee-bong also buys weapons and a map of the sewers from a group of men so they are prepared for searching for Hyun-seo.Meanwhile two brothers Se-jin and Se-joo are searching for food when they are attacked by the creature. They attempt to flee but are both 'eaten' by the creature. The creature then takes both brothers back to the sewers where it regurgitates both of them with only Se-Joo coming out alive. Hyun-seo sees that Se-Joo is alive and they both hide out of sight from the creature.While Gang-Du and his family are searching the sewers and streets for Hyun-Seo they stop at a food stand to rest. The next morning Hee-bong tells Nam-il and Nam-joo that Gang-du can't help being the way he is because of his miserable childhood which he hypothesises affected Gang-du's physical health and mentally disabled him. Soon after they are attacked by the creature. They fire at the creature but quickly run out of ammunition. Gang-du believing he has shells left in his shotgun gives his gun to his father at his request so that he can attempt to hold off the creature buying his family some time. As Hee-bong is about to fire at the creature Gang-du realises he has miscounted his shots and that his shotgun is empty. As he looks back to his father Hee-bong is attacked and killed by the creature. Gang-du runs back to his father but the Army and scientists arrive and capture Gang-du. Nam-il and Nam-joo are able to hide but are separated from each other while Gang-Du is taken away screaming in agony over his father's death.While Nam-joo is searching through the sewers she comes across the creature and tries to attack it with her bow. She hesitates to take a shot and the creature knocks her down into a hole knocking her unconscious. The creature unable to reach her continues running through the sewers.After being placed in a special medical facility Gang-du is interrogated by two scientists. Interpreting his ravings about his still-alive daughter as a product of infection by the virus they decide to operate on his brain in an effort to extract a samplea procedure they deem necessary as until now they have found no actual trace of any virus. As he is being prepared for the operation however Gang-du manages to break free. Taking one of the nurses hostage with a syringe of his supposedly-infected blood he escapes to continue his search for his daughter.Nam-il attempts to get help from a friend who tells him that the Government have placed a bounty on his and his families heads. While in an office building Nam-il is betrayed by his friend for the bounty. Nam-il evades capture from both his friend and the police and flees. Nam-il wakes up the next morning with a homeless man (Yoon Je-moon) sitting next to him. After talking they both join together to try and find Hyun-seo and kill the creature.Back in the sewers while the creature is sleeping Hyun-seo ties together clothes from the bodies of the dead to create a rope. She successfully latches the makeshift rope to the top of the drain but while she attempts to jump up to the rope she is caught by the creature. The creature seemingly still sleeping gently puts Hyun-seo back on the ground. Terrified Hyun-seo slowly attempts to hide but the creature leaps at her and Se-joo and swallows the both of them.Meanwhile the government announce they will release a harmful chemical called Agent Yellow into the river and its surrounding areas that they hope will kill the creature. People against Agent Yellow arrive starting to protest its release.Gang-du finally finds the sewers where the creature kept Hyun-seo but the creature and Hyun-seo are not there. As Gang-du climbs down into the sewer the monster passes over him. He sees Hyun-seo's arm hanging out of the creatures mouth and starts to chase after it. As Gang-du is running after the creature he comes across Nam-joo and noticing that it is heading towards the protest go after it together. As Nam-il and the homeless man arrive at the protest and as the creature attacks Agent Yellow is released. Agent Yellow appears to hurt the creature but doesn't kill it. As the creature is laying on the ground Gang-du sees Hyun-seo in its mouth. He pulls her and Se-joo out but Hyun-seo is revealed to have died clutching Se-joo who is still alive. In a fit of rage Gang-du attacks the creature with a metal pole but is knocked to the ground. Nam-il and the homeless man then come to Gang-du's aid with Nam-il throwing Molotov cocktails at the creature. The homeless man climbs up to the platform above the creature and starts to pour petrol onto it but as Nam-il goes to throw his last bottle he drops it. Nam-joo then picks up the flaming cloth from the bottle with one of her arrows and fires it at the creature hitting it in its eye. The creature bursts into flames and attempts to run to the Han river when Gang-du appears from behind one of the bridges pillars with the metal pole in hand and impales the creature in its mouth finally killing it.As Nam-il and Nam-joo hold Hyun-seo mourning her death Gang-du walks over to Se-joo and picks him up taking him away from the protest and to safety.Time passes and Gang-du is living with Se-joo in his food stand. At night Gang-du believes he sees something in the distance picking up a shotgun but then realizes it was nothing. Gang-du and Se-joo then sit down to have something to eat while a news broadcast about the monster attack on the TV is on. The film ends with Se-joo asking Gang-du to turn the TV off so they can concentrate on eating.

In the North Pole a strange huge white egg-like thing is found. Some scientists take the thing to the laboratory. At first the sceptical people are the ones who are listened to by the politicians. Dr. Kate Brecher (Janine Eser) is worried about the thing. She thinks it's not only spacial rubbish but a kind of alien container which may become dangerous.Julian Rome (James Spader) is an expert in computer language. There are a kind of strange transmission he's getting but he seems not to be able to crack it. A Russian submarine is in the watchout. They are approaching the polar base fast. The crew don't look happy at all.At the beginning they think that the alien object is a kind of rock but first results show that there is a kind of carbon alloy which has never been seen before on planet Earth. The scientists decide to open the box with a laser beam and special machinery like a stronger welder. At that very same moment Julian has the idea to treat the mysterious message as a kind of labyrinth. He re-programs the computer and a new message seems to appear repeated over and over again: the sentence DO NOT OPEN appears over and over again. Julian and Shelly Klein (Aimee Graham) run to tell the rest of the crew to leave the alien box alone but it's too late. Something seems to be moving inside the white cocoon. As soon as he enters the huge warehouse there is an explosion. Everything seems to blow up.When the explosion is over they start looking around for casualties. One of the scientists says that she doesn't feel very well and at that moment she falls to the floor - as though she were a ragged doll - and the body gets kinda deflated. She is not the only one: two other people suffer the same almost immediate death.Dr. John Bachman (Roy Dotrice) starts wondering what the alien will do when they capture it. The lights have gone off so they have to find the fuse in the dark lit by weak torches.Julian's light falls to the floor. At that moment he realises that the alien is close by. The alien moves slowly towards him. It feels attracted to the torch until it goes off. Then the bigger-than-a-human creature faces Julian attentively. It is a wet alien who hugs Julian's head. Julian has visions of a foreign planet.Julian and the rest of the survivors - 7 all in all - finally communicate with their base; they finally get to talk with Bachman and his advisors. They are informed that an alien contact has happened before - in Roswell New Mexico USA. The aliens have a virus inside of them which they are immune to but which can kill any human almost instantly. Infection seems to spread through the air. The alien race which is inside the white cocoon is friendly but when they tried to talk to the Martians they killed all the civilization in that planet almost instantly. Bachman tells that the Russian submarine is approaching fast but that the crew's orders are to contain the infection at all costs not to rescue the remaining scientists. Bachman also admits - to Julian's question - that the aliens usually communicate through telepathy.Dr. Michael Straub (John Lynch) wants to leave the base immediately but Julian tells him that nobody can leave the polar station until Shelly has discovered a way to detect the pathogen fight the infection and cure it. Straub insists so Julian ends up punching him. T.Dr. Alexi Gierach (Nikolai Binev) the pilot (Anthony Crivello) and the co-pilot (Kaloyan Vodenicharov) have just got their order. They are in shooting range of the base at the same time that some of the scientists try to run away as Shelly has not been able to identify the pathogen in the blood of the survivors. She has the notion that the pathogen may get hidden inside the proteins and cells of the human body but at that moment she has no clue.While they are leaving they have to go through the underground garden in which the scientists used to grow their own vegetables. Michael touches one of the of the corn cobs and it immediately rottens up. At that moment he realises that all the humans inside the scientifical compound have sufferd contamination. Julian runs after Michael who succeeds in reaching the white frozen land surrounding the building.However there is a kind of twister of energy. It is possible - but difficult - to breathe. Michael keeps on trying to run away so there are like two bolts of lightning which kill him off. Julian enters again in the building and he tells everybody to leave the building walk slowly breath calmly and as he has just had a telepathic vision of thousands of aliens in their world he tells everybody to join the two shadows - two aliens - who want to take them to their planet. That way they will live in a place where there is not risk of them contaminating everything and everybody. Julian finally convinces everybody but it looks as though Shelly is left behind. However on the nick of time Julian convinces her. The transparent starship leaves with all the remaining survivors. Exactly at that moment the Russian rocket arrives to its destination blowing everything up.There is a newscast talking about the deaths of Julian Shelly Kate... The president is going to make an annoucement about it.At exactly that moment we see the alien spaceship flying away - with the surviving humans inside.

"In this third 'Lone Wolf and Cub' movie Ogami Itto the disgraced former shogun's executioner or Kogi Kaishakunin is travelling by river on a boat with his young son Daigoro floating behind in the baby cart. A young woman at the front of the boat clearly distraught for some reason accidentally drops a bundle into the water which Daigoro retrieves.Itto meanwhile draws his sword part way and notices in the reflection on the blade that some bamboo reeds are also trailing the boat. Itto is being followed by operatives of his mortal enemy the Yagyu Clan; a constant threat that he can never ignore. Later as Daigoro is relieving himself in a bamboo glade Itto slices some bamboo stalks causing some ninja assasins to fall from their perch.According to the voice-over narrator this is a time in the Edo period in Japan when there are ronin or at the very least a low-class of samurai termed ""watari-kashi""; small bands of fighters who move from job to job working from one ""daimyo"" (feud lord) to the next depending on who's hiring.A group of four watari-kashi are idling along the road. Hot and bored they spy an attractive young woman and her mother being escorted by a servant. Three of them run off to take advantage but one of the band Kanbei the more honorable of the four remains uninterested. The three knock the escort unconscious and proceed to rape the two women. The servant regains consciousness and is furious when he sees the triad violating his mistresses. He attempts to beat them with his bamboo pole but is slain by Kanbei who then also slays the two women to silence them. Kanbei then makes his three companions draw straws saying the one unfortunate enough to draw the short straw will be killed to take the blame for the rapes and murders.Itto happens along this grim scene just as Kanbei is slaying the watari-kashi who drew the short straw. Itto kills the other two rapists when they attempt to attack him. Kanbei recognizes Itto and requests a duel. Itto accepts and they prepare but at the last second Itto re-sheathes his sword and calls it a draw leaving Kanbei to ponder his fate alone. ""You are a true warrior"" Itto says ""One I hope lives on.""At an inn it turns out that the young woman from the boat is to be sold into prostitution. Her pimp tries to have his way with her but she bites off his tongue spitting the bloody appendage onto the floor. The pimp dies from the injury.The girl seeks refuge in Itto's room who steps in to protect her from the local police. But then the town's real authorities show up which are the local Yakuza led by a young woman named Torizo. Some verbal sparring begins as Itto defends the girl against Torizo's threats. After Torizo pulls out a pistol and fires at shot at Itto's feet to indimidate him into surrendering the girl Itto agrees to act as a substitute for the young woman and undergo ""buri-buri"" a form of torture that involves the subject being hogtied and hung in the air and repeatedly dunked headfirst into a tub of water. The subject is then beaten to unconsciousness by men wielding thick rattan canes and shouting ""buri-buri"". Itto endures the torture with his typical stoicism. This frees the young woman from having to work as a prostitute.Itto still with a debt to pay for the death of the pimp agrees to take on an assassination for Torizo and her father a one-armed man that Itto is acquainted with from his past life as the shogun's executioner - acting as second during the execution of a daimyo who fear-stricken struggled dishonourably; Torizo's father had restrained the daimyo sacrificing his arm to Itto's killing stroke.The target is a corrupt district deputy. Initially Itto is to face the deputy's personal bodyguards one of whom is a sharpshooter and quick-draw artist who wields a pair of revolvers. Through cunning and guile (and the help of his young son Daigoro who acts as a decoy) Itto defeats the armed man and takes his guns. The other is defeated by Itto in a sword duel.Itto's battle culminates in his facing the deputy's army perhaps 200 men singlehandedly. For the first time the true power of the baby cart is revealed as it proves to harbor an entire arsenal of weapons including spears daggers a bullet-proof shield and a small battery of guns capable of taking out many enemy soldiers like a heavy machine gun. All of the deputy's men are killed as Itto first takes out half of them with the baby cart's machine gun and then takes out the rest with his sword and other weapons from the baby cart. The deputy is the last to fall when Itto deprived of his sword when it falls out of his hands when he falls down an embankment takes out one of the pistols he took earlier from the deputy bodyguard and uses it to shoot and kill the deputy. Itto then discards the gun and reclaims his sword mumbling to himself that firearms are so uncivilized.Word of the fight has been passed to neighboring districts and the ronin Kanbei shows up just after Itto has slain the deputy and makes his demand again for a duel. Though battle-weary Itto accepts the challenge. The fight is over in an instant. Itto is sliced across his back but Kanbei is mortally wounded impaled on Itto's Dotanuki battle sword.As Kanbei kneels to the ground dying he tells Itto his story and why he became a ronin a tale involving an ambush on his master's convoy. Seeing his side outnumbered Kanbei seized an opportunity and ran ahead to attack the enemy head on. He surprised the enemy and prevailed in deflecting the hostiles and saved the lord's life as a result but since he left his lord's side he was dishonored and expelled from the clan.

<<<<contains spoiler>>>>>The story has the underlying themes of Chaos theory and chain of events. It begins with the 12th century with a conflict between the worshipers of two Gods namely Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu. The king being a Lord Shiva devotee decides to sink the Vishnu idol which is opposed by Rangarajan(kamal) a vishnu devotee. So the king ties rangarajan with the idol and drowns them in the sea.The story propels forward to the current century where a very harmful bio-chemical weapon is invented in the United States for defense purposes. However following a hazardous leak Govindarajan (the protagonist played again by Kamal) decides to prevent it from being used. There are people who are not happy with this decision and decide to stop him by hiring an Ex-CIA assassin Christian Fletcher (Again Kamal). The Virus somehow lands in a cargo shipment that is on its way to Chennai India. Govindrajan and Fletcher race to the other end of the world in a bid to conquer this vial. The rest of the movie is a cat and mouse game into which many other characters (most played by Kamal himself in keeping with the theme of the movie) are drawn. The movie reaches a dramatic conclusion when the protagonist Govindarajan fails to stop the leakage of the virus (Fletcher consumes it and hence causes it to decay his body and spread onto the beach shore). This act would have destroyed a million lives except that it is already established that the virus can be neutralized by pouring down tons and tons of NaCl.The chaos theory takes control again with Tsunami rocking the seashores of Chennai one that brings with it tons of NaCl courtesy the salty sea water. This miracle is linked to the incidents that occurred back in the 12th century (the god sunk in the sea centuries agoalthough killing thousands saves the lives of millions in the form of Tsunami) conferring that everything happens for a reason and god exists.The ten roles Kamala Hasan plays in the movie are The hero/Scientist Villan Ex-CIA assassin an old lady the vishnu devoteeintellegence officer(indian) a muslim a scheduled caste leadera japanese martial arts guy a punjabi pop singer and George Bush.
After realizing the danger of a bio-weapon a scientist wants to protect it from being misused. The vial accidentally reaches India and he must race against time to prevent a potential disaster.
U.S.-based Bio-technologist Govind K. Somaiyya narrates from a stadium a tale of religious conflict in India - even before the appearance of Jesus and Allah. This conflict was between worshipers of Bhagwan Shri Shiv and Bhagwan Shri Vishnu - with devotees of the latter being put to death. Now in post-9/11 era President George W. Bush invests heavily in biological research but things get out of control when a vial containing a deadly chemical is inadvertently dispatched via courier to Tamil Nadu India. In order to retrieve it Govind must face heavy odds including a deadly CIA Agent Chris Fletcher; a killer named Jasmine; RAW Officer Pranab Kundu as well as a martial-arts artist from Tokyo.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)

"The opening crawl reveals that the galaxy is in the midst of the war. Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) has been kidnapped by the Separatists' second-in-command General Grievous. Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) and Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) lead a mission to rescue him. After killing Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) and freeing the Chancellor the Jedi attempt to escape but are captured by General Grievous. Anakin and Obi-Wan manage to break free but Grievous escapes and traps the Jedi and the Chancellor inside the severely damaged cruiser. Anakin is forced to crash-land the ship on one of Coruscant's landing tracks.Upon his return Anakin is reunited with his wife Padm Amidala (Natalie Portman) who tells him that she is pregnant. Despite Padm's worries over their secret marriage Anakin is overjoyed at this news and the couple makes plans to raise their child. However Anakin is troubled by visions of Padm dying in childbirth visions similar to those he had of his mother just before she died. Later Obi-Wan privately tells Anakin that the Council wants him to spy on the Chancellor because they believe him to be corrupt an order Anakin resents since the Chancellor has become a mentor to him. As the Chancellor's bodyguard Anakin develops a close friendship with Palpatine who subtly manipulates Anakin in their discussions making him distrust the Jedi. Palpatine claims to know of an ability to prevent death.Obi-Wan is sent to Utapau where he engages and kills General Grievous. Meanwhile back on Coruscant Palpatine reveals himself to Anakin as the Sith Lord Darth Sidious who has been controlling the Republic and the Separatist movement. Anakin leaves to expose him to the Jedi Council. Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) arrives at the Chancellor's office shortly thereafter and eventually subdues Palpatine through a lightsaber duel. Just as Anakin arrives Windu is about to slay the Chancellor. Anakin quickly disarms Windu believing the Chancellor holds the only way to save his wife. Windu is consumed by Sidious' torrents of force lightning forcing him out a window and to his death. Darth Sidious takes Anakin as his Sith apprentice and gives him the name Darth Vader. He then orders Vader to kill all Jedi within the Jedi Temple then to go to the Mustafar system and eliminate the Separatist leaders.Darth Sidious orders clone troopers across the galaxy to turn against their Jedi Generals by enacting a pre-programmed directive Order 66. Numerous Jedi across the galaxy are seen being exterminated although both Yoda and Obi-Wan survive. Darth Vader slaughters all the children in the Jedi Temple. Afterwards he goes to Padm and tells her the Jedi have attempted to take over the Republic and leaves for Mustafar where he slaughters the Separatist leaders. Senator Bail Organa (Jimmy Smits) rescues Obi-Wan and Yoda (Frank Oz) and brings them to the Jedi Temple before heading to the Senate building. Palpatine informs the Senate of a Jedi plot to overthrow the Republic. As a result he announces that the Republic will be reorganized into the Galactic Empire. In the Jedi Temple Obi-Wan and Yoda stand in shock over the bodies of the younglings and reconfigure a signal to warn all Jedi to keep away. Obi-Wan looks into the security recordings and to his horror sees a hologram of Vader carrying out the orders of Darth Sidious and kneeling to him. Though he initially refuses Obi-Wan eventually agrees to find and kill Vader and Yoda decides to fight the Emperor. Obi-Wan then meets with Padm who refuses to believe his claims about Anakin's fall to the dark side. When she departs for Mustafar Obi-Wan secretly stows away onboard.Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader fight on Mustafar.When the couple is reunited Padm pleads with Vader to leave public life with her but he refuses believing that he can overthrow Palpatine so that he and Padm can rule the galaxy together.

Obi-Wan and Vader break into a vicious lightsaber duel.Back on Coruscant Yoda confronts the Emperor who unleashes force lightning on the ancient Jedi. Yoda in return throws the Sith Lord across his Senate office. The two most powerful practitioners of the Force engage in a fierce duel inside the Senate Chamber itself. When it appears that Yoda has the upper hand Sidious unleashes the Force to the point that Yoda is forced to retreat and decides that his failure has led him to go into exile. As his troops search for the Jedi Darth Sidious decides to go to Mustafar saying ""I sense Lord Vader is in danger.""Back on Mustafar the former Jedi friends are now bitter enemies. The duel brings them out of the facility to unprotected areas of the volcano planet. Obi-Wan eventually gains the advantage of higher ground and when Vader attempts to attack again Obi-Wan slices off both of his legs and his left arm in two swift cuts. Vader tumbles down the embankment and rolls to a stop at the edge of the lava. He catches on fire sustaining near-fatal third-degree burns and severe lung damage. Obi-Wan leaves Mustafar with the hurt Padm and Anakin's lightsaber. Darth Sidious arrives on Mustafar a short time later and rescues Vader from the brink of death.Padm is given medical assistance and although she is physically intact her will-to-live is gone. She delivers twins a boy and a girl and gives them the names ""Luke"" and ""Leia"". Just as Padme tells Obi-Wan that there is still good in Anakin she dies. On Coruscant Vader's missing limbs and damaged body parts are replaced by cybernetic prostheses and implants. Vader is put into a full suit of black armor and is sealed in a respirator mask which will allow him to survive his injuries. When Vader asks Sidious about Padm's condition he tells Vader that in his anger Vader himself killed Padm. Vader unleashes a furious scream of mournful rage and destroys droids and equipment throughout the room with the Force while Sidious looks on with an evil grin. Aboard the Tantive IV Obi-Wan Yoda and Bail Organa agree to keep the children hidden and separated. Obi-Wan and Yoda will watch and wait until the time is ready for the Skywalker children to do their part in the battle against the Sith. Leia is taken to Alderaan to live with the Queen and Bail Organa and Luke is transferred to Tatooine to live with Owen and Beru. The film concludes with Owen and Beru holding Luke while staring out over the desert at Tatooine's twin suns.

"The movie opens in flashback to about 1980 at a fair in Indiana of some sort with pie eating contests etc. The camera settles on a boy magician named ""Harry the Great"" who is about to perform a trick where he saws a girl in a box in half with a chainsaw. Midway the girl lets loose with a series of piercing screams panicking the audience and some nearby adults who rush up and open the box. The girl is just pretending to be hurt and smiles up at the adult man professing ""I'm going to be an actress"" before he slaps her.The movie cuts to a generic Hollywood beautiful person party where we see Harry (Robert Downey Jr.) fully but shabbily clothed intentionally teetering at the edge of a pool full of bikini clad women. At this point the narrator (Harry) introduces himself and apologizes somewhat defensively for not being very good. ""Do you see any other narrators?"" he asks. (The movie repeatedly revisits the idea that the narrator isn't a trustworthy source. The symbolism is that the pool represents the Hollywood lifestyle and he's trying to decide whether to jump in or not). He (as the narrator) asks us if we want to know how he got here.We now cut to a small toy store late at night. Two thieves are rummaging around. One of them Harry is on the phone with his niece as she describes the action figure (""CyberCop"") she wants for Christmas. Harry pretends that the store is open and he's on a regular shopping expedition but his niece isn't buying it (it's too late at night). A large UPS truck drives by jostling the wiring on the jury rigged alarm and setting it off. The two run out the back door and into an alley where they are fired upon by a woman on a fire escape. Harry's partner is hit but Harry escapes on foot as the police approach. He runs from alley to alley until he encounters a milling group of men who are all dressed in dark thiefish clothing like himself. He runs up a stairway and crashes into a room with 3 or 4 people sitting around a desk. A woman tells him they're not ready for him yet but another man a Larry Miller-ish casting agent (played by - who else - Larry Miller) tells him to go ahead and hands him a script. It's from some sort of hard boiled crime thriller in which the main character is being berated for allowing his partner to be killed. Harry stumbles through it for a couple of lines before the similarity to his current situation gets to be too much and he loses it throwing a chair and putting his head on the lap of one of the casting agents and begging forgiveness. At this moment a cop bursts through the door before apologising for interrupting and ducking back out. Larry Miller says he's found what he's looking for and hires Harry for the part suspiciously quickly - his motives become clear much later...Meanwhile back at the party a woman (Michelle Monaghan) named Harmony is introduced by the narrator who dips a little into her back story through a few brief flashbacks - noting that she is from a small town likes reading a crime series about a detective called ""Johnny Gossamer"" and alluding to the fact that their father may have sexually abused her sister Jenna. The narrator then realizes that he isn't explaining how she got to the party which he then goes into the reason involving an actor from a cancelled TV show about a robot who drunkenly broke into her house in his costume. Long story short she gets invited to the party where she is seen going over the bookshelves in the house until she finds some copies of the same old paperback detective series - ""Johnny Gossamer"". She hugs them tenderly reads from them for a bit and then passes out on a table. A sleazy man enters and seeing her unconscious - starts to poke around in her underthings before Harry walks in. Harry tries to intervene but ends up being beaten to a pulp - reflecting he never was very good at fighting. After the man walks away Gay Perry (Val Kilmer) helps Harry up. He tells Harry he's a high end private detective who's been hired by the films producers to train Harry in the ways of private detecting. He takes him into the bathroom and helps him clean up. Harlan Dexter (Corbin Bernsen) pokes his head in and introduces his daughter who is getting ready to cut her birthday cake. She has apparently been in Europe for many years and threatening to sue her father over her deceased mother's money but they've patched things up and are all nicey-nicey.Gay Perry is getting ready to leave the party when Harry asks him about the woman. Perry recognises her and recommends Harry go to the Domino bar which he does.Harry shows up at the club and walks past the doorman without being hassled. He encounters a woman named Flicka (Angela Lindvall) has a brief conversation (she tells him she's a stewardess he lies and tells her he's a PI (important later). It takes about an hour. The woman from the party is sitting at the bar. Harry sits next to her and launches into conversation. They flirt a little bit with her suggesting Harry take up with the woman across the bar who's 35 and still attempting to act. Harry asks her how old she is and she says she's 34. Harry starts to walk away after a little banter but she calls him back. She can't believe he doesn't recognize her. She's his childhood friend Harmony (the girl being sawn in half at the beginning of the movie by young magician Harry). Harmony's friend shows up and becomes very hostile - trying to drive Harry off. Harmony calms her down and Harmony and Harry head to a table.Harmony describes growing up in Indiana parallel to Harry. She was turned onto the Johnny Gossamer books by reading them to her invalid mother. Her father was a child molester who abused her younger sister while she stood helplessly by. She compensated by sleeping with everybody in high school except Harry who was her best friend and Harry's best friend because he asked he not to. As soon as she could she escaped to Hollywood to be a star but the only work she's gotten is as a European milkmaid in a cheesy beer commercial with a CGI bear. Harry asks if she wants to come back to his place and to show he has good intentions suggests she bring her hostile friend with her.Harry wakes up the next morning with a girl in his bed. He thinks it's Harmony but is shocked to find out it's her hostile friend instead. He runs to Harmony's place and apologizes profusely at her door. She's initially pissed but somewhat mollified as he goes.Perry and Harry are heading out to a stake out. Gay Perry says that he's got a commission from a woman named Allison Ames whom he has only spoken to over the phone - to stake a place out and record anything that happens. Harry and Perry drive down a windey dirt road to a woodsy house and hide behind a woodpile with a video camera . Someone comes out of the house in a ski mask gets in an old beater car and drives off. Harry and Perry follow them by car. They seem to lose him and stop by a pond next to a low ridge to get their bearings. As they look around the beater car comes shooting airborne over the ridge and lands in the pond. Harry jumps into the water to save the driver as Perry says no one was in the car. Harry persists and finally Perry dives into the water emerging holding a body. It's a woman in a sundress - she's dead with a broken neck. They drop her on the sand. Harry notices she has no underwear (plot point). Perry says they need to cover this up like they were never there. Harry ""helpfully"" throws Perry's gun into the water. Perry points out that that was a custom ceramic gun given to him by his mother and it's very traceable. He then smacks Harry in the nose with a briefcase. Two figures in ski masks appear on top of the ridge and shout at them before taking off.Perry drives Harry back to Harry's hotel. As he drops him off and Harry is walking away Perry returns with Harry's ringing cell phone that was left in the car. Giving it to him and they both listen as Harry answers. It's the police asking him if he knew of Harmony because her body needs to be identified before being ruled as suicide. Harry is left heartbroken and goes back to his hotel room to drown his sorrows when there's a knock at the door. It's Harmony somehow alive. Turns out her younger sister has come to town stolen her credit cards maxed them out ($2000 to an unspecified party) and then committed suicide; which explains the mistaken call; as the police initially identified the sister as Harmony herself. She's distraught and wants to talk to Harry since she thinks he's a private detective (Flicka told her). She eventually badgers Harry into investigating her sister's murder (she doesn't believe it was suicide) and then faints - it seems Harry agrees so he can spend more time with Harmony in much the way he would get a kick out of her crying on his shoulder when she was upset as a teenager.She eventually wakes up again and leaves as Harry heads to the loo. The bathroom is long and deep with the toilet on the far end a bathtub to the left of the toilet and a towel closet to the right of the toilet. Harry is relieving himself standing up when something on the left catches his eye. He turns to look without interrupting the stream and winds up covering the corpse from the car trunk with pee. Someone's stashed it in his bathroom. He crawls into the towel closet and calls Perry. Perry says that it's a setup and somewhere in the room they must have also hidden a gun. Harry quickly finds it under the bed. Down in the hotel lobby Harmony is just leaving as the cops arrive. She overhears that they're headed to Harry's room and makes a quick judgement to misdirect them to a different room. Perry shows up and they bundle up the corpse again. They can't figure out how to get it out of the hotel so they decide to take it up to the roof and toss it into a dumpster in an alley. They miss and the body bounces off the edge of the dumpster. Harry and Perry rush down to the alley and shove the body into the trunk of the car. Just at that moment the police drive by. Perry grabs Harry and kisses him to make it seem like they're having a liaison. The police crack some jokes and drive off. Harmony shows up just in time to see the kiss. Harry and Perry ditch the body at a random street side location.The next day Harry and Perry meet and Perry gives Harry two pieces of bad news: 1) He isn't really up for a role in the film. He's being used to demonstrate the producer's seriousness about recasting the role so that Colin Farell will accept less money. 2) He told Harmony that he isn't a PI and she's pissed. Also it turns out the body in the car was Dexter's daughter (The one who was trying to sue Dexter for the mother's inheritance). Harry heads to the airport to fly home.While he's waiting for his flight he sees Flicka and tries to chat her up but she's not very interested. Somehow it comes up that Harmony's stage name is Allison Ames (the name of the woman that hired Perry) and he rushes back to Harmony's place realising the $2000 Harmony's sister spent was to hire Perry to investigate the case he and Harry were on when the car drove into the lake. She doesn't want to hear it and slams the door on him severing a joint and a half of his left ring finger. She rushes him to the hospital where it's precariously sewn back on and lightly bandaged up. They also drug Harry up really good on pain killers so he's pretty stoned. In a phone call with Harmony he explains the link between the two cases and leaves a message for Perry who will be at a party Harmony is working that evening. Harry heads over (High as a kite) and they find Perry - who seems disinterested and heads off to an unrelated stakeout of some girl telling the two to behave until he returns. Harry wanders off to look at a dancer dressed like a deer but is jumped by two thugs (A white guy and a black one who calls himself ""Mustard"" - the same thugs in ski masks who appeared on the ridge after the lake crash) who beat him up and almost pull his finger off again before telling him to get out of town. Harmony and Harry rush off to the hospital to get his finger fixed again when Harmony notices that the two black and white thugs are headed towards Perry's stakeout and insists on going to warn Perry before getting Harry's finger fixed. Harry passes out in the back seat as Harmony parks the car and jumps out to find Perry. She's jumped by one of the thugs but manages to get the better of him and knock him out - unable to kill ""Mustard"" the thug but taking his gun.A girl with purple hair shows up and Perry starts following her. She purposefully leads him under a bridge the white thug driving up behind him - starting to line up in order to run Perry over. Harmony rushes to save him dropping her gun and accidentally catching Perry's attention - he spots the approaching car and leaps out of the way. The driver careers toward a hot dog stand destroying tables - just as Gay Perry prepares to kill the white thug as he exits the vehicle the hot dog vendor shoots the thug down. In the chaos the girl with purple hair runs around looking for an escape. She finds a car with the door open and the keys still in it. Of course it's Harmony's car with Harry passed out in the back seat. Harmony returns to where she left the first thug but he's gone.Harry wakes up the next day in the back seat of the car in a strange garage in a strange house totally confused (which must mean he got there the entire way without the purple-haired girl seeing him lying asleep in the backseat...) He walks around inside calling out but no one responds. The surviving thug shows up with the girl with purple hair so Harry hides under a bed. He hears them talking. She's apologizing for the foul up but says it isn't her fault. The thug agrees and says a number of ominous things about how he's going to set things up so it's never her fault again and then shoots her dead. Harry holds his fingers to her lips as she mutters before dying. The thug runs off to get something to wrap the body with. So Harry in a daze gets out from under the bed. The thug comes back and sees him. The thug starts taunting him until he realizes he's left the gun on the bed. Harry shoots him. Harry's finger has come off so he puts it in a bowl with ice and calls Perry. While he's talking to him a dog comes up and grabs the finger. Harry tries to get it back but the dog swallows it. Harry seems resigned to its loss. He then cleans off the gun puts the girl's fingerprints on it so the police will think she and the thug killed each other and leaves.Harmony Perry and Harry get together to wrap things up secure in the knowledge that the whole thing was a kidnapping plot gone wrong. Perry jokes that it seems anti-climactic: No one's been tortured yet (foreshadowing). Harry and Harmony head up to Harry's room. Harmony mentions that in an attempt to save her sister's sanity she told her that their father wasn't really their father. She lied that he was a famous Hollywood film star that had visited town on a ""Johnny Gossamer"" film shoot. They get wasted at the hotel bar. As Harmony strips in the bedroom to go to sleep Harry is reminded how the body from the lake wasn't wearing underwear. He offers to sleep on the couch but they both wind up in the bed about to sleep together when Harmony says she has to admit something. The next shot is Harry throwing her out because she confessed to sleeping with his best friend in high school the one guy he asked her not to. Harry makes sure her fingers are clear before slamming the door.Harmony wanders off when something occurs to her. She calls Harry up and asks if the body in the trunk was raped. He replies that it wasn't the report came back negative. He hangs up. A little later Perry calls Harry up and says Harmony left a message saying she had it all figured out. Perry wants to know what Harry told her. Harry racks his brain and then mentions the underwear thing. Perry seems to all of a sudden magically figure out what's going on. Perry and Harry go to the local insane asylum where they meet a large woman patient. They ask her to lift her robe. She does. No underwear. Perry puts it together: Dexter had hidden her daughter away in the looney bin and replaced her with a lookalike so that he could use her to request that the lawsuit dropped. But the daughter's European boyfriend was coming to visit so he had to kill her to bring the ruse to a close (the boyfriend would see through the double). Harmony's sister must have been the double which is why they murdered her and made it look like a suicide. Perry and Harry assume that Harmony also went to the asylum and was grabbed so now they have to find her.Harry and Perry head out from the asylum where they meet an orderly who holds them at gunpoint and starts marching them back. Perry gets the gun from him and they start trying to interrogate him. Harry fantastic magician that he is decides to take the orderly's revolver and pretend to play russian roulette with him to add force to the interrogation. He thinks there's an 8% chance of the one bullet he left in the gun going off. And of course it does. Scratch one orderly. As Perry and Harry hide the body they're surprised by Dexter and another thug. While they're getting frisked Perry's phone rings. The thug takes the phone and throws it over to Dexter but Harry catches it and shuts into the phone that they've been caught by Dexter. The thug retrieves the phone from Harry listens and tells Dexter that it was just a carpet cleaning service. But it was actually Harmony who managed to pretend to be someone else.They're taken to a hospital to be tortured. We learn the thugs are heading to cremate Dexter's daughter ASAP to remove evidence of gunshot wounds. Thug #3 hooks up electrodes to Harry's balls and proceeds to start the torture. Perry starts taunting him with homophobic slurs. The thug gets angry and starts yelling at Perry pounding on the electrode button to emphasize his point. Harry's not having a good time. Finally Perry mimes grabbing at his balls but it turns out he has a gun hidden there. The thug is killed by bullets flying out of Perry's crotch - he explains homophobes never check the pelvic region.Harmony calls Perry - she's been at home the whole time. She rushes to the hospital. Dexter and company have loaded the body into a van and are about to leave. Harmony grabs the van and drives off. Three thugs who waited at the van grab a car and chase the van. The back doors of the van are open so the coffin is in danger of flying out at any time. Harmony crashes the van on an overpass sending the coffin over the edge. It lands on a sign above the underpass. An arm pops out. Harmony's OK though. Harry and Perry keep running up and get into a gunfight with one of the thugs. The thug is shot but not before shooting a bullet through Perry's chest and into Harry. Harry tries to give Perry mouth to mouth but Perry starts coughing up blood. Meanwhile Harmony has jumped off the road and into a median slamming her forehead on the grass and drawing blood.

anything to get some drugs. The pusher is angry until

returns with him to a shabby apartment. Just when it
seems like they are going to have sex the woman pulls

woman who tells him her last name is Coffin and that
her sister is LuBelle Coffin. LuBelle is now in a
hospital having shot up with tainted heroin and her
mind is permanently damaged. The enraged woman forces
the man to take another hit of heroin which kills
him.The woman is known to her friends and associates as
Coffy (Pam Grier) a nurse at a city hospital. Coffy has a romance with political hopeful Howard Brunswick (Booker Bradshaw) but she is devoted to caring for her sister. She gets news of her ""hit"" from Carter (William Elliott) a policeman friend of hers. Carter is a good cop who refuses to take payoffs from local mobster Arturo Vitroni (Allan Arbus) and as a result Vitroni sends his henchmen to knock Carter around. Coffy happens to be in the way at the time and both of them wind up in the hospital. Coffy is little more than shaken but Carter is beaten unconscious and seriously injured.More angry than ever Coffy sets out to stop the mobsters once and for all. She learns of a pusher named King George (Robert DoQui) who is supplying heroin to local dealers. George is also a well-known pimp; Coffy is vaguely familiar with George because one of his prostitutes Priscilla (Carol Locatell) once came to Coffy's hospital after George cut her face. Coffy visits Priscilla at her home and leans on her for information about George and his business practices. Priscilla tells Coffy about Arturo Vitroni and how he is one of George's best clients. Vitroni apparently likes to treat his hookers cruelly humiliating them and making them do degrading things for his pleasure. Priscilla balks when Coffy asks her where George keeps his stash; she is afraid that if she tells Coffy this George will find out and kill her so she pulls a knife on Coffy and tries to frighten her off. Instead Coffy turns violent shattering a wine bottle and threatening Priscilla with the jagged edge. Priscilla tells Coffy that George keeps his heroin stash in a box under his fireplace. Just then Priscilla's tough lesbian pimp Harriet (Dea St. Lamont) returns and fights with Coffy who just barely escapes.With the information she got from Priscilla Coffy sets out to infiltrate George's business. She sets up a meeting with King George and pretends to be a Jamaican hooker named Mystique. George immediately takes her into his fold much to the chagrin of George's 'old lady' Meg (Linda Haynes). During a party at George's pad the jealous Meg dumps a tray of cocktails in Coffy's lap. When she goes into George's bedroom to clean up Coffy sees her opportunity and accesses his drug stash disposing of all his heroin and replacing it with ordinary sugar. Returning to the party she then picks a fight with Meg and winds up fending off Meg and the rest of the girls. Coffy emerges the victor when Meg cuts herself on a series of razor blades that Coffy has hidden in her afro. Arturo Vitroni witnesses the fight and he so taken by Coffy that he requests a session with her that very night.Coffy arrives at Vitroni's house and attempts to assassinate him but she is stopped by Omar (Sid Haig) Arturo's bodyguard. They make the mistake of believing that King George has sent Coffy to make a hit on Arturo so they retaliate. Keeping Coffy locked up they lure George into a limousine and then kill him by tying a rope around him and dragging him behind the vehicle.They are undecided about what to do with Coffy. One of Vitroni's goons recognizes Coffy from the night they roughed her up along with Carter; another of Virtoni's shady associates recognizes Coffy as Howard Brunswick's girlfriend. Believing her to be a hit woman the gangsters summon Brunswick unsure about whether he is associated with Coffy's attempted hit. Vitroni is suspicious when he realizes that Coffy and Howard do indeed know one another but Coffy insists Howard had nothing to do with her attempt on Vitroni's life blaming it entirely on King George. To her dismay Howard betrays Coffy and tells Vitroni that for all he cares they can kill her.Omar and some other goons take Coffy to a desolate area of the city with intentions of killing her and dumping the body. Along the way they inject her with some heroin they took from King George's stash--Coffy knows it's really just sugar. She distracts them with her feminine wiles and manages to stab Omar in the throat mortally wounding him. Another goon chases Coffy out onto a busy freeway where he is run down by a passing vehicle. The third goon a crooked cop tries to run Coffy down after chasing her under a bridge but she shatters his windshield with a brick and he flips the car. Coffy steals his shotgun just before the car explodes killing him.Coffy stashes her shotgun and hitches a ride with a stranger luring him out of the car and stealing it once he's gone. She returns to her hiding place and retrieves the shotgun then returns to Vitroni's and drives the car straight into the house killing one goon who was standing on the porch. Inside she lets loose with her shotgun killing everyone she sees until she has Vitroni cornered in a swimming pool. She toys with him and tells him she'll take a million dollar payoff to let him live but after he tells her where Brunswick went she shoots him anyway.Coffy's revenge isn't complete until she pays a visit to Howard. She slips into his beach house and surprises him holding the shotgun on him. Howard is shocked to see Coffy alive and even more shocked to hear that she's killed all of his shady associates. Howard manages to soothe Coffy convincing her that he was only playing along with the crooks to buy time. But his speech is interrupted by a woman calling for him from upstairs; a semi-nude white woman walks out of one of the bedrooms. Coffy responds by gunning down Howard right there in his living room as the terrified woman screams in horror. Coffy then stumbles out into the morning light grimy and covered with bloody scratches and bruises but alive."

"A privately owned luxury Boeing 747-100 Stevens' Flight 23 (call sign two-three Sierra) complete with piano bar office and bedroom is used to ferry invited guests from Washington DC to Miami and to an estate owned by wealthy philanthropist Philip Stevens (James Stewart). Valuable artwork of the Stevens' private collection is also on board the jetliner to be eventually displayed in his new museum. Such a collection motivates a group of thieves led by co-pilot Bob Chambers (Robert Foxworth) to hijack the aircraft in the hopes of landing it on an abandoned airfield on St. George Island so they can sell the artwork to smugglers and then flee to a South American country.Once Captain Don Gallagher (Jack Lemmon) leaves the cockpit and is knocked unconscious the hijacker's plans go into motion. A sleeping gas is released into the cabin and the passengers lose consciousness. Knocking out the flight engineer Chambers puts the plan in motion and Stevens' Flight 23 ""disappears"" into the Bermuda Triangle. Descending to virtual wave-top altitude Flight 23 heads into a fog bank reducing visibility to less than a mile. Minutes later a large offshore drilling platform emerges from the haze Flight 23 heading straight for it at close to 600 knots.Chambers pulls back on the yoke in a banking left turn but the engine number 4 clips the derrick causing the engine to catch fire. Chambers immediately hits the fire extinguishing button and flames are momentarily extinguished. However because the aircraft is at such a low altitude the sudden loss of airspeed threatens to stall the airplane. As the engine reignites Chambers is forced to use another fire-suppression bottle. But by this time the aircraft stall alarm goes off and the aircraft's tail hits the water. All the passengers wake up and most start to scream and panic. Chambers is able to pull up but soon the plane's right wing hits the water again and the plane lifts into the air for another moment then hitting the water again. Because of the impact being so hard the plane becomes grounded in the ocean. Eventually the plane begins to slip beneath the waves.The ocean bottom is fortunately above the crush-depth of the fuselage. Many of the passengers are injured some seriously. Two of the would-be thieves are killed in the initial crash. Banker (Monte Markham) is in the hold securing the art for the transfer when a cargo container causes a breach of the outer skin crushing and drowning him. The second fatality is Wilson (Michael Pataki) another thief who is killed when he is slammed into the flight panel on impact.Since the aircraft was off course search and rescue efforts are focused in the wrong area. Involved in these efforts are Phillip Stevens himself and Joe Patroni (George Kennedy) whom is now the director of field operations of the Stevens Corporation. The only way to signal rescue efforts to the proper region is to get a signal buoy to the surface in a small dinghy. Captain Gallagher and diver Martin Wallace (Christopher Lee) enter the main cargo in the attempt but an unexpected triggering of the hatch crushes Wallace. Gallagher out of oxygen provided by the dive gear makes it to the surface and activates the beacon after he climbs into the dinghy. Getting a fix on the new signal an S-3 Viking overflies the crash site confirming the location of Flight 23.The U.S. Navy then dispatches a sub-recovery ship the USS Cayuga (LST-1186) along with the destroyer USS Agerholm (DD-826) and a flotilla of other vessels. The aircraft is ringed with balloons and once inflated the aircraft rises from the bottom of the seafloor. Just before the plane breaks surface one of the balloons breaks loose prompting the Navy captain to reduce the air pressure of the remaining balloons thus keeping the plane just beneath the waves. At that moment one of the doors in the cargo hold bursts open causing the plane to flood. The cascade of sea water sweeps through the passengers; First Officer Chambers is killed when he is pinned under a sofa. The deluge also sweeps away Wallace's widow (Lee Grant) who drowns just as the Navy captain orders more air pressure into the balloons finally raising the plane successfully. Once on the surface the passengers are evacuated. With the survivors on their way to waiting ships Captain Gallagher and Stevens' assistant Eve (Brenda Vaccaro) are the last to evacuate from the aircraft as it slips under the waves for the last time.

Later after John escapes from the detention center a top secret Air Force Stealth Bomber known as the X-77 which uses the latest in stealth cloaking technology making it capable of going anywhere undetected is stolen by corrupt Air Force pilot Ratcher. General Tom Barnes John's former commander hears that John has been arrested after taking down a group of men who were robbing a rest stop. Knowing that John was Ratcher's trainer Barnes sends John to northern Afghanistan with fellow pilot Rick Jannick to recover the X-77 promising John that he will be a free man if he succeeds. Barnes has Admiral Frank Pendleton who is on an aircraft carrier in the Gulf of Arabia keep a team of pilots on standby just in case an air attack needs to be launched on the compound where the X-77 has been hidden. Before John and Jannick arrive in Afghanistan a Navy SEAL team that was planted there to meet them is killed by a group of men led by Eliana Reed. Not long after John and Jannick arrive Eliana kidnaps Jannick and she takes him to her boss Peter Stone the man who paid Ratcher $100000000 to steal the X-77. Later in a village close to Stone's compound John meets up with his contacts Jessica and Rojar. Jessica tells John that the SEAL team was killed. As it turns out Stone was born from a Muslim mother and a British father. Stone had spent his childhood in the Middle East but was educated at Oxford.

"Movie opens with roar of race car engine clunking out on the back stretch of deserted race oval. Stands are empty. Cut to the driver as he goes to the gas pumps and finds them padlocked. Next cut to him looking for someone - shouts back to guy sweeping up about the gas. The janitor says says something like ""I can get you anything but I can't get you gas. And I'm sorry about your family Mr. Hart; I'd have sent flowers buy you can't even get them anymore.From this introductory exchange the movie informs us through the narration of Lee Majors that we are in a post-apocolypic future in which a gasoline shortage and a plague outbreak have decimated the country. Cars are now illegal and society has settled into a state of ""utopian"" existence where people drive get around by mass transit and the police drive electric golf carts and people have been consolidated into the major urban areas of the East Coast. We learn also that Mr. Hart lost his wife and son in the plaugue. During this narration the film shows him trailering his race car back to his home. It shows him driving his station wagon through a throng of people at an aid camp and being ordered out of it by a soldier. As he is riding the train back from working at the camp time fast forwards about 10 years and Mr. Hart exits the train in a business suit looking somewhat older and greyer into the ""utopian"" future city of Philadelphia. He is now a lecturer at something that resembles the Department of Transportation and his job is to talk about mass transit to high school students as someone who used to race cars. Meanwhile on the campus of an unnamed prep school there is a montage of scenes involving a nerdy kid who doesn't fit in. The other boys rip up his science notes. He blows up their baseball. They hang him upside down from the quad statue. He blows the head off the statue. Then we see him using an old school computer and modem to jam the government's computers. At home while Frank Hart is watching home movies on the envisioned successor to the VCR a broadcast from Radio Free California appears on his TV. They say they have returned to their city their roads and their cars.Things for Frank take a turn for the worse at work. He is called in for an interview with an agent from the ""adjustment bureau"" who shows confronts him about breaking in to a junk yard. They have an little raprte in which he keeps using ""old"" words like junkyards and jail and she corrects him with the new words like ""vehicle graveyard"" and ""rehabilitation center"". In the final exchange he tells her there are too many ""rules"" to which she says they are ""laws"" and he replies ""Lady you got too damn many laws.""From this point on the plot follows an arc in which Frank Hart flees Philadelphia in his old race car bringing along the boy from the prep school and travelling the back roads of an abandoned American heartland. The folks at the adjustment bureau including a guy from Washington brought in specially to deal with the ""car crisis"" make a number of attempts to stop Mr. Hart principal among them is hiring a former air force ace and retrofitting his old Korean War era sabre jet so he can hunt down Frank Hart. This ace has become a bit of a wine-o and seems to be longing for the good old days himself. He initially strafes the car as it pulls off the road and Hart is wounded. He manages to get into the treeline where a group of survivalists find him and the boy and take them in. However a SWAT team is sent in to raid the camp and find the car and the two must leave. Eventually the pilot and the race car driver face off mano a mano with their machines and not so surprisingly it turns out that they are on the same side. Meanwhile Hawkins the ""Washington"" administrator and the bureau has instructed Mr. Morley the tech guy to activate a ""Star Wars"" laser on the west coast and put it on automatic so that it will shoot anything that moves. The laser however is mechanically damaged with age and will not shoot above a certain elevation. The laser cannot shoot down the plane. Captain Williams attempts to report the laser to Hart but their radios are jammed by the bureau. Realizing that Hart will be targeted by the laser Williams zooms ahead and destroys the laser with a kamikaze dive. Before going down he radios in to Mr. Morley that he ""Sees chance to wear medals again."" With the laser destroyed the car arrives in California and the closing scene shows people turning out in the streets and crowding around as they drive into San Francisco. An announcement of the cars arrival is narrated by the voice of Radio Free California.In the final scene back at the adjustment bureau in Phili Mr. Hawkins packs up his things and before leaving gives a brief eulogy for their utopian world that this ""will set us back to the 1980s""."

This is a story not about the mob or the mafia or a black hit man per se. They are contexts for a much deeper morality. The story is about the contrast of good and evil. The evil is the master and the good is the servant. The servant honors the master thus the good serves the evil. Yet this paradox is resolved by the ultimate sacrifice the good endures to redeem the evil. Simple to see but deserves contemplation.

Martin Lloyd seeks out SG-1 for assistance when his failed TV show based on the real Stargate program becomes a feature film.::beckmen@yahoo.com
"On General Jack O'Neil's personal recommendation his -unwilling- former SG-1 mates are ordered to advise Hollywood production executive Martin 'Marty' Lloyd on a 'slightly ridiculous' version of the Stargate operations. The brainstorming proves rather unsatisfactory for both sides despite repeated recourse to personal -often self-flattering- imagination and various real experiences so the team members are relieved when General Landry calls them as promised for a mission but just then the Gate breaks down temporarily. Marty also gets discomforting phone calls and even more preposterous alternatives are considered 'til an apparent ""deus ex machina"" appears...::KGF Vissers"

In Egypt circa 1290 BC high priest Imhotep engages in an affair with Anck-su-Namun the mistress of Pharaoh Seti despite strict rules that other men are forbidden to touch her. When the Pharaoh discovers their tryst Imhotep and Anck-su-Namun murder the monarch. Imhotep is dragged away by his priests before the Pharaoh's guards can discover his involvement; Anck-su-Namun then kills herself intending for Imhotep to resurrect her. After Anck-su-Namun's burial Imhotep breaks into her crypt and steals her corpse. He and his priests flee across the desert to Hamunaptra the City of the Dead where they begin the resurrection ceremony. However they are caught by Seti's guards before the ritual could be completed and Anck-su-Namun's soul is sent back to the Underworld. For their sacrilege Imhotep's priests are mummified alive and Imhotep himself is forced to endure the curse of Hom Dai: his tongue is cut out and he is buried alive with a swarm of flesh-eating scarabs. The ritual curses him to become an immortal walking plague if he were ever to be resurrected. He is buried under high security sealed away in a sarcophagus below a statue of the Egyptian god Anubis and kept under strict surveillance throughout the ages by the Medjai descendants of Seti's palace guards. If Imhotep were ever to be released the powers that made him immortal would allow him to unleash a wave of destruction and death upon the Earth.In 1923 soldiers from the French Foreign Legion led by American Rick O'Connell make a final stand at Hamunaptra against an overwhelming force of Medjai warriors. The soldiers are massacred and O'Connell makes a final retreat inside the city only to be cornered by a group of Medjai. However they flee when Imhotep's evil presence manifests itself leaving him to die in the desert.In 1926 Cairo librarian and aspiring Egyptologist Evelyn Carnahan is presented with an intricate box and map by her bumbling brother Jonathan who says he found it in Thebes. The map seems to point the way to the lost city of Hamunaptra where all of the wealth of Egypt was supposedly stored; however the museum curator Dr. Bey dismisses Hamunaptra as a myth and accidentally damages the map. Jonathan reveals he actually stole it from an American (revealed to be O'Connell) who is currently in prison and may be able to tell more about Hamunaptra. Rick tells them that he knows the location of the city from his days in the Foreign Legion. He makes a deal with Evelyn to reveal the location of Hamunaptra in exchange for Evelyn saving Rick from being hanged. Evelyn successfully negotiates his release from the prison warden by offering him 25% of the found treasure; however the warden insist on coming along in order to protect his investment. They board a ship to start their expedition to the city where they encounter a band of American treasure hunters led by the famed Egyptologist Dr. Allen Chamberlain and guided by Beni Gabor a cowardly former Legion soldier who served with Rick and also knows the location of the lost city.During the journey the boat is invaded by Medjai soldiers who are looking for Evelyn's box and the map. The expedition manages to fight them off but the map is lost and the boat goes up in flames forcing the entire party to go ashore. Rick Evelyn and Jonathan are separated from the other treasure hunters and procure camels at a nearby market. Since Rick knows the way to the city they arrive at Hamunaptra at the same time as the other party but due to tensions between the two groups they start exploring the city in separate locations. The Americans discover a chest between the legs of the statue of Anubis. They have it opened by several of their carriers but the chest is booby-trapped and the carriers die from an acid spray. In the meanwhile Evelyn is looking for the Book of Amun-Ra a solid gold book supposedly capable of taking life away. Her team discovers a tomb buried directly below the statue of Anubis. Evelyn's box turns out to function as a key that opens the tomb; inside there is a sarcophagus. Suddenly the prison warden runs by screaming in pain. Unbeknownst to the rest he had found a decorative scarab but it contained a real scarab that entered his body and ate a way into his brain. The warden knocks himself into a wall and dies instantly.After a quiet evening outside Rick and Evelyn get in a romantic mood when suddenly both groups are attacked by the Medjai led by a warrior named Ardeth Bay. Rick forces a stand-off by lighting a stick of dynamite and threatening to blow everyone up. Bay warns them of the evil buried in the city and gives them one day to leave. His groups then ride out. Rather than heed his warning the two expeditions continue to work on their respective projects. The sarcophagus is opened and contains the gory remains of Imhotep. The team of Americans meanwhile open the chest in spite of a warning on its lid that threatens to kill everyone who takes its contents. They discover the black Book of the Dead accompanied by canopic jars carrying Anck-su-Namun's preserved organs; each of the Americans takes a jar as loot while Dr. Chamberlain takes the book but Beni flees the scene out of fear for the curse.At night Evelyn takes the Book of the Dead from the Americans' tent; her key also fits on it. She reads a page aloud accidentally awakening Imhotep's mummified remains. Immediately the first plague announces itself: a swarm of locusts invades the terrain forcing everyone inside the city. The entire group is separated into smaller parties when a giant army of scarabs breaks loose and eats everything in its path. One of the Americans gets lost and is attacked by Imhotep who takes his eyes and tongue while partially regenerating his body. Evelyn also encounters Imhotep and he seems to recognize her as Anck-Su-Namun; however Rick shoots him down before everyone flees the catacombs. They run into Ardeth and his group of Medjai warriors again. He berates them for resuccecting Imhotep who will now bring along death and destruction. The only thing to do is flee the city until a way can be found to kill him again. The entire group leaves but Beni is left behind. He also encounters Imhotep but successfully pleads for his life and is allowed to become his slave.Both groups return to Cairo. Rick and the Americans plan to leave Egypt but Evelyn decides to stay reasoning that releasing the curse was their fault so they have the responsibility to stop Imhotep. That afternoon the next plague announces itself: water turning into blood signaling that Imhotep is nearby. The group deduces that Imhotep will go after the four men who took the Book of the Dead and the canopic jars. Beni has indeed taken Imhotep to Cairo helping him trace the Americans. Rick and Jonathan track down the American whose eyes were stolen; they find his desiccated body and Imhotep slowly regenerating his own. Rick tries to kill Imhotep but he is invulnerable to weapons; only the presence of a cat in the room startles him and he flees in a dust storm. Rick returns to his quarters as the second plague starts: violent hailstorms ravage the city. He locks Evelyn in her room to keep her safe from Imhotep ordering the remaining two Americans to stand guard while he and Jonathan leave to warn Dr. Chamberlain. The doctor's chamber is empty but they witness Imhotep killing Dr. Chamberlain in the streets taking the Black Book and releasing a swarm of flies. Imhotep proceeds to Evelyn entering the room and consuming the body of the American on guard. He enters the sleeping Evelyn's bedroom through the keyhole by transforming into sand and tries to kiss her. Rick Jonathan and the remaining American enter and scare him away by threatening him with a cat.The group goes to the museum hoping that the museum curator Dr. Bey may have some answers. They are astonished to find him together with Ardeth Bay. Dr. Bey reveals to also be a member of the secret society sworn to prevent Imhotep's resurrection (which is why he purposely tried to burn the map). He theorizes that Imhotep will fears cats (the guardians of the underworld) until he is fully immortal; he also thinks that Imhotep intends to resurrect Anck-su-Namun using Evelyn's body to regenerate it. All of a sudden a solar eclipse occurs so they have to make haste. Evelyn hypothesizes that if the black Book of the Dead brought Imhotep back to life the gold Book of Amun-Ra can kill the high priest once again. The group finds a tablet in the museum that describes the location of both books and Evelyn deduces that the gold book must be buried beneath the statue of Horus. At that moment a large group of natives covered in boils and sores (the next plague) and under Imhotep's spell surround the museum. The heroes leave the museum by car but the remaining American is captured during the pursuit and consumed by Imhotep. Finally cornered by his followers the fully regenerated Imhotep offers Evelyn to come with him in exchange for letting the others go. She agrees but as they leave Imhotep goes back on his words. Dr. Bey sacrifices his life by holding back the crowd of followers while the rest flee through the sewers.Rick Jonathan and Ardeth enlist the help of Winston Havlock a desillusioned WWI fighter pilot to fly them over to Hamunaptra. Imhotep returns to Hamunaptra in a sandstorm carrying Evelyn and Beni pursued by Rick's plane. Imhotep uses his powers to cause a huge sandstorm but distracted by Evelyn he only succeeds in letting the plane make an emergency crash landing killing only Winston. Rick Jonathan and Ardeth enter Hamunaptra and discover a new area ful of Hamunaptra's famed treasures. They quickly get into a battle with Imhotep's resurrected mummy priests so they make their way to the statue of Horus where they find the Book of Amun-Ra. However when cornered by the priests Ardeth sacrifices himself to allow Rick and Jonathan to escape. Imhotep in the meanwhile has resurrected the mummified remains of Anck-su-Namun and is preparing to sacrifice Evelyn when Rick and Jonathan interfere. Rick frees Evelyn from a group of mummies while Jonathan reads an inscription on the book in order to kill Imhotep; unfortunately this only summons a group of mummified guards who go after Rick while Evelyn is attacked by the resurrected Anck-su-Namun. Jonathan succeeds in finishing the inscription giving him command of the guards just before they kill Rick; he commands the guards to kill Anck-su-Namun. Imhotep turns his anger towards Rick while Jonathan and Evelyn succeed in opening the Book of Amun-Ra. Imhotep is about to kill Rick when Evelyn recites the counter-curse. Imhotep's immortal soul is taken from him and he becomes mortal. Rick fatally stabs him and rapidly decaying into a mummy again Imhotep leaves the world of the living vowing revenge. Beni who was secretly dragging treasure outside accidentally sets off an ancient booby trap. As Hamunaptra begins to collapse into the sand Rick Evelyn and Jonathan race towards the exit with Jonathan accidentally dropping the gold book. Beni remains behind and is trapped and eaten by a swarm of flesh-eating scarabs. The heroes escape before Hamunaptra disappears in the sand. Ardeth who has unexpectedly survived waits for them outside andthanks them for their help. They ride off into the sunset on a pair of camels laden with Beni's treasure.

In 1889 a Nevada silver mine is mysteriously attacked killing 17 miners. Most residents of the nearby town of Rejection pack up and leave. Juan Pedilla (Brent Roam) one of the surviving miners will not leave because he dreams of paying off his own ranch. The telegraph notifies the remaining people that an Easterner is coming to find out about the mine. The prissy and snobbish Hiram Gummer (Michael Gross) arrives and scoffs at the account of events at the mine. He bulldozes the innkeeper Christine Lord (Sara Botsford) into running a tab for him rather than paying in advance.Hiram and Juan go with the remaining miners to check the mine and find nothing. As they camp for the night one of the men playing the concertina suddenly disappears as the horses scatter. Another man is pulled underground to the horror of the others. A monster swallows the whistling teapot on the fire and the group shoots over and over. A pickaxe kills one of the monsters but the other two men are also killed. Juan and Hiram survive by climbing on a nearby rock. Hiram notices the monsters have no eyes and Juan realizes the monsters are following sounds. They walk over the rocky hills back to town. At the store run by Pyong Lien (Ming Lo) and Lu Wan Chang (Lydia Look) Hiram has their son Fu Yien (Sam Ly) telegraph an ad for a gunfighter to several newspapers.While they wait the townspeople continue with assorted improvement projects. Young Fu Yien sees Hiram give up on repairing his bicycle and fixes it. Hiram gives him the bicycle but scorns doing any work himself. The townsmen use their steam engine to dig a well and even the boy helps.The menacing Gunslinger Black Hand Kelly (Billy Drago) arrives and they explain about the monsters. He agrees to the job after exacting Hiram's diamond cufflinks and gold coin watch fob as a down payment. They choose some guns from Christine's collection and ride out to the mine. They fail to attract monsters by hammering a rock at their last camp so they approach the mine. Kelly fires a shot to attract the monsters without result. At the hot spring piped out of the mine they find empty egg shells that were unearthed by the water and evidently hatched. As they continue riding they find Old Fred's (J.E. Freeman) wagon broken in half and abandoned and then discover his decapitated head.Since the rocks are so far away they decide to camp at the abandoned muling station believing that the floor of thick beams will be sufficient protection. In the night the horses are startled by rumbling and flee the corral and then long snake-like things with mouths invade the building. Gunfire frightens them off. Kelly decides to teach Hiram how to shoot. Several shots seem to attract the creatures - then they notice the snake mouths pulling away the floor beams one by one. They notice a telegraph key at the wall and Hiram orders Juan to use it. After an hour Fu Yien realises that the random signals are coming from the muling station and Christine heads out to rescue the group. In the meantime a giant monster attacks Juan at the key but he manages to escape. Kelly is horrified to see what they are up against realizing he does not have the firepower to take on these monsters. As the creatures probe the floor Kelly steps back his ornaments jingle - and a monster gets him.Christine arrives with a wagon and they race back towards town pursued closely by a monster until Hiram shoots one of the horses with a rock from Fu Yien's slingshot. Back in Rejection Hiram packs to leave telling the others they should leave. Juan offers to get blasting powder from Carson City but Hiram refuses. The townspeople stand firm. He promises to send payment to Christine for his debts. She tells him he can keep the horse and other items in exchange for ownership of the mine. He says he planned to sell the mine back east - and she promises to wire ahead the news about the monsters. Defeated he tells her to keep the mine.Hiram rests in comfort in Carson City while Juan spies the trail of monsters heading for Rejection despite the rocky pass. As Hiram goes to buy his train ticket back east the station telegraph signals Rejection's distress. He leaves the station fingering his watch thoughtfully. In Rejection a line of covered wagons shows the citizens have finally packed and are ready to leave when they see Hiram driving a wagon towards them. He gives each person a heavy gun and uncovers a huge punt gun. They make plans for the monsters' approach how to trap them various ways of making sound to attract them and to show when they have arrived.They release the horses and ring a large metal triangle against a rock. After a long time they believe nothing is happening. Suddenly a monster approaches and the boy comes out to help - Hiram and the Changs rush to get him back inside. As Hiram returns to the punt gun he misses the monster. It returns and he kills it. The second monster approaches from the side and takes the punt gun! Juan has to climb a telegraph pole to escape a monster which then starts lowering the pole. Tecopa (August Schellenberg) takes the band saw and puts one end in the post hole in the ground and hammers on it. The monster speeds toward it and dies on the blade. The third one comes after Tecopa and appears to have gotten him - but then spits out the cigar store indian instead. They know their guns have little effect so they decide to use black powder to make a big firecracker to blow up the last monster but it is time-consuming. The telegraph suddenly goes off attracting the monster to the store with Fu Yien inside. The tent collapses and the monster's tongue continues to seek him. The adults outside make noise but cannot attract the monster. Fu Yien slices his way out of the tent and the monster emerges from the wreckage as well. The women and Fu Yien take refuge on a wagon but the monster focuses on them and one snake tongue grabs Fu Yien's arm. The men take the belt off the steam engine and add a hook to it creating a long fishing line. The hook the monster's tail and then wrap the belt on the engine allowing it to reel in the monster. It builds up speed and the impact with the engine kills the monster.Later a telegram has approved Hiram's loan to reopen the mine. However he points out that it's no longer his mine. The townspeople agree that it should still be his mine. He sets two conditions: that they never tell anyone about the monsters and that the first profits from the mine be used to build a new hotel and store with real walls pay off Juan's ranch and build a statue of Tecopa.At the end Fu Yien Christine and Hiram are target shooting at cans. Hiram has decided to stay and supervise the mine and has selected a location for his home - hopefully for two (with a sidelong glance at Christine). Hiram still can't shoot so she reveals a present for him: a gatling gun that allows him to hit the target!

In 1889 the town of Rejection Nevada depends on a nearby silver mine for its income. Rejection has a few residents. Christine Lord runs the local inn which doesn't get a lot of business because Carson City is the busiest settlement in the area. Pyong Lien Chang his wife Lu Wan Chang and his son Fu Yien Chang are immigrants from China and they own Chang's Market. Other residents include Old Fred Brick Walters Stony Walters Big Horse Johnson Soggy miner Juan Pedilla and Christine's friend Tecopa. When a hot spring causes four eggs to hatch several men who work in the silver mine are killed by whatever hatched from the eggs. Everyone is too terrified to enter the mine. No one wants to risk their lives even if shutting down the mine would mean the death of the town. With the mine shut down the mine's owner Hiram Gummer arrives in the area from Philadelphia to investigate. Juan acts as Hiram's guide. As it turns out each egg hatched a Graboid but 1889 was about 100 years before they were called Graboids so Hiram calls them Dirt Dragons. When the Dirt Dragons prove to be too much for the residents of Rejection to handle Hiram calls upon Black Hand Kelly the fastest gunslinger in the west. Kelly brings in the heavy artillery which proves to be absolutely useless when the baby Dirt Dragons grow to enormous size and one of them kills Kelly. As a result Hiram decides to leave town while everyone else refuses to leave the place that they call home. While Hiram is in Carson City he intercepts a wired message that the Dirt Dragons are no longer in the area where the mine is -- they're heading right for Rejection. Hiram goes to a local firearms store and he returns to Rejection very heavily armed. With those weapons which include a huge punt gun Hiram and the townspeople prepare to defend the town against the Dirt Dragons.::Todd Baldridge

Ellen shows up and they toast his retirement.At the Adama-Thrace apartment Lee and Kara are debating politics and getting drunk. Or Lee is and Kara is laughing at him for having bought into it. Zack arrives with another bottle of wine and dispels Kara's belief that Lee is an idealistic dreamer. He's a cynic Zack explains which is why Lee and Adama are no longer on speaking terms. Kara is excited to hear the family angst. Zack says dad believes in the system and the uniform and something greater than himself. Lee says Adama believes in his system only and if you're not with him you don't exist to him. Zack wonders why Lee followed in his footsteps then. Lee answers that going into the service paid for college. Zack says this proves Lee is a cynic. Kara says she's starting to like him now.A man arrives at Laura Roslin's house with flowers. It is her blind date Sean. She's trying to place where she knows him from. As she pours wine for them she realizes with a laugh that she was his teacher.

She says she didn't say he should go and smiles adding ""the night's young and apparently so are you so let's see what happens.""Back at the strip club Tigh and Adama are arguing over whether Tigh would ""do it"" for all the money in the world and for a civilian desk job.

Tigh says they won't be able to take much of it. Ellen tells Sam it's time and plugs him in. We see the colony hybrid connect with Sam. Sam seizes and the colony hybrid derails shutting down the guns. Ellen informs them the colony is offline and that they'll be launching raiders. Tigh launches the vipers as the raiders appear. Adama orders full speed ahead and they crash Galactica into the center of the colony. This causes chaos fire and damage to all parts of Galactica.The firefight outside begins between raiders and vipers led by Hot Dog.Inside where the two ships have attached via the crash assault one- led by Lee and Kara- busts out of the back of Galactica and repels down to the colony. Centurions lead the way through the halls. Realizing they have pressure they doff their helmets and move out.Out in space the raptors are dodging the debris field as the second assault team prepares to approach from another direction. It's bumpy ride for Helo and Athena on one. On another piloted by Racetrack they decide to go in weapons hot. As they arm their nukes she and her co-pilot begin to reminisce about another battle when the windshield is struck and cracked by a huge asteroid.The battle rages on.In the CIC Adama and Tigh bark out orders to the vipers.Assault two touches down.The two assault teams make their way through the halls.The doctor Cylon (Simon) does tests on Hera as Boomer watches. She can't believe he's just going to keep doing stuff as the fight rages outside. Simon says Boomer overestimates their chances and that the Cylons have superior fire power and numbers and in the end it's all about mathematics. Boomer doesn't like math and breaks Dr. Cylon's neck and grabs Hera and hotfoots it outta there.Centurions fight Centurions and old school Centurions the assault teams fire.In sick bay Roslin waits for the injured.On the CIC Tyrol goes to Sam and begs him to stop sucking up so much power more or less. Sam babbles and backs off.Vipers and raiders fight.A PR Cylon (Doral) a Doctor Cylon (Simon) and Cavil have seen what Boomer has done and one says they shouldn't have trusted her. Cavil says it wasn't a matter of trust but his underestimation of her need to make futile gestures. Cavil says it's time to go on the offensive.Galactica is rocked and Caprica Six and Baltar wait. She says she's proud of him for doing this and says she always wanted to be proud of him and that she always felt that was the only thing missing. Because they are who they are they kiss. As they do Head Six says all the pieces are falling into place. Both Caprica Six and Baltar stop kissing and look to where she and Head Baltar are standing. Head Baltar says they will hold the future of the humans and the Cylons in their hands. Simultaneously they both say ""I will?"" Then they look at each other and ask ""you see them?"" Just then the Cylons blow a hole in the deck right near them and Centurions pour in. The reserve forces do their best to cut them down.Back on the colony the assault teams continue the firefight. Assault one runs into Boomer and Hera just as assault two does as well. Boomer puts Hera down and she runs to mommy. Boomer tells Athena to tell the old man she owed him one. Athena starts to explain their plan and Starbuck says ""Can we not tell her the plan?"" (We get a flashback of Boomer standing before Adama and Tigh in Adama's quarters. The men are angry she hasn't been able to land her ship properly and that she's in danger of washing out. Boomer begs for another chance. Adama gives it to her and she promises him she will pay him back when it really matters.) Athena says it doesn't change what Boomer did and Boomer agrees but said that she made a choice today. She also informs them they can't go back the way they came. Athena shoots Boomer dead.Roslin and Ejay are dealing with an overwhelmed sick bay. Laura is sad to see Ejay put a black X on one man's head.The now joined assault teams decide to go back the way assault one came.The firefight outside continues to rage.In the CIC Tigh barks out orders to hold back the boarders in one COMM while Lee informs Adama they have Hera on another. Hits continue to land a fire breaks out in the CIC. Adama barks out that the assault teams are expected back in 5 minutes.Caprica Six and Baltar help cut down Centurions and Baltar keeps firing even after they're down until he hears someone shouting ""We're friendly!!"" It's Lee and the assault teams they're back. Baltar apologizes. Lee tells him not to worry about it saying he did good.Roslin sits in sick bay. She pulls out her medicine and injects herself. As she does she has a vision of Hera running through the opera house. She gets up and starts run/walking down the halls she can barely stand up straight.Helo Kara and some Marines ferry Hera through the halls. Doral comes up behind them and shoots a Marine in the back and then shoots Helo who goes down. Athena tends to him but as she does Hera runs down the hall. Helo tells Athena to go after her.As Athena follows her we get crosscuts between the actual scene and the scenes of Athena chasing after Hera in the opera house.Roslin- also cross-cutting with her opera house visions- happens on Hera and though they are reunited for a moment Hera runs off again.Roslin and Athena run into each other just like in the opera house.Baltar and Caprica Six then run into Hera. They grab her and seal themselves off into a hall just as Roslin and Athena are almost on them. Baltar and Caprica Six realize that this is the opera house scene and what they have to do. They bring Hera into the CIC which is in the midst of a gun fight. They look up to see the final five just like in the opera house. Dead bodies are strewn everywhere.A marine points out that there's a Cylon still alive. Adama orders him taken out. He then sees that Baltar has Hera and announces it to everyone. Then an explosion rocks the ship and Cavil elbows the Marine holding him and grabs Hera holding a gun to her head. All the armed people in the room have their guns trained on him. He says this ""thing"" is the key to his people's survival and he's not leaving without it. Baltar points out it's not a thing but a child and that she holds the key to humanity's survival as well.Cavil wonders how he knows that and he says he sees angels. We cut to a shop of Head Baltar and Head Six standing nearby. He says he might be mad but that doesn't mean he's not right. He says there's another force at work here and that there always has been and that everyone in the room has experienced things they can't fathom or explain away rationally: puzzles deciphered in prophecy dreams given to a chosen few our loved ones dead risen. Whether they want to call it God or gods or divine inspiration it doesn't matter it's undeniable. Their destinies are entwined. Cavil says even if that were true how do they know this ""force"" has their best interests at heart that God is on your side? Baltar says God is not on any one side but a force of nature beyond good and evil which were created by man. (Angel Six and Angel Baltar smile approvingly at this speech). Baltar says if they want to break the cycle: birth death rebirth destruction escape death well that's in their hands and their hands only. It requires a leap of faith that they live in hope and not fear. Cavil says if he gives up Hera then he's consigning his people to extinction. He wonders how that fits into the picture Baltar is painting.Tigh pipes up that the final five will give them resurrection in return for Hera but the war ends now they leave humanity in peace for now and all time. Cavil says it's a deal. Adama wonders how they know they can trust him. Cavil says they don't they'll have to make a leap of faith. Everyone agrees and Cavil orders a Cylon cease fire.The vipers come in for a landing on Galactica and the heavy raiders pull away.In the CIC a PR Cylon stands over one of his fallen models and then joins Cavil and a Dr. Cylon.Lee reports to Adama that the vipers are in and four were lost. Kara reports that seven raptors were lost.Caprica Six sits with Athena and Hera. Baltar comes along and helps Caprica up.Apparently the final five will be transmitting the designs for resurrection by all sticking their hands in Sam's goo or so explains Adama to Roslin.Before they do Ellen explains that when they stick their hands in they'll know everything about each other. A nervous Tory says they'll be able to see each other's thoughts and memories and to remember they've all done bad things and made mistakes. Tigh is all you're forgiven for all your deep dark secrets. Ruh-ro.In the hands go and in turns we see a series of quick flashbacks for each of the final five. A Dr. Cylon reports the resurrection designs are downloading nicely. As we get to Tory though we see her airlocking Cally and Tyrol freaks out and pulls his hand out of the goo and begins choking Tory. Sam screams the colony hybrid screams the Dr. Cylon reports the download has broken off. The PR Cylon thinks it's all a trick and starts opening fire again. Tyrol breaks Tory's neck. The colonial forces in the CIC take out the Cylons Cavil says ""frak"" and eats his own gun. The colony starts firing on Galactica again.Out in the debris field the very dead Racetrack's floating raptor is jostled causing her hand to come down on the weapons deployment. She sends her nukes straight at the colony posthumously saving the day. As it breaks apart Adama tells Starbuck to get them the frak out of there. Starbuck runs over to the FTL and says she doesn't have the rendezvous coordinates. He doesn't care and tells her to just jump them out. She says ""there must be some kind of way out of here"" and starts to have visions of the song: her father showing her how to play it Hera handing her the drawing her own coding of notes to numbers and plugs those numbers into the FTL and jumps the ship.At the moment of the jump we flash back to Lee and Kara drinking shots. They finish one and he tells her she's tempting fate. She says if she has a fate it's set and thinking about it won't make it happen any faster. Fair enough he replies but flying when you're thinking about dying as she does every time she gets in the cockpit is not a good combination. She says she's not afraid of dying she's afraid of being forgotten.As Galactica reappears it shudders and cracks and heaves from the stress of the jump. Tigh reports that they have their main systems but the ship's back is broken and she'll never jump again. Adama says wherever they are is where they're going to stay. Roslin asks Kara where she's taken them. She smiles.From the outside we get a shot of Galactica crossing the moon- our moon- and coming up to a vision of our Earth.A title tells us it's 12 Hours Later as the rest of the fleet jumps into Earth's orbit. A raptor takes off for earth and what is clearly the outline of Africa.We go down to the surface where Doc Cottle Tigh Adama Baltar and Hoshi- who gives his admiral's wings back to Adama- are on their stomachs in tall grass observing some indigenous peoples.Baltar reports that this was the most advanced civilization they could find on the planet. They are clad in loincloth type things are carrying spears and appear to be pre-verbal. Cottle who ran some tests on some dead folks he found nearby says their DNA is compatible with theirs. So says Baltar it will be possible to breed with them. Adama quips that Baltar has a one track mind. Baltar takes offense until it's pointed out that Adama is joking. Adama wonders how it's possible that there could be human beings naturally evolved on a planet one billion light years away. The odds are astronomical. Baltar says one might even say there's a divine hand at work. Adama says whoever is responsible they're here to stay with our new family and peeps at the indigenous peeps again.In another area where a temporary HQ has been set up Lampkin is talking to Lee and another dude about how the plans for a city on a nearby river can be laid out fairly quickly on the landscape which is amenable to cultivation. Lee doesn't like this idea he says no city not this time. Lampkin wonders what Lee proposes they do.Lee takes Adama off on a walk and tells him they should break the cycle leave it all behind. Adama says Lee is talking about bringing down 38000 people- the entire human race- with nothing but the clothes on their backs and some provisions. Lee says it's not the whole human race pointing out that there are people already here. Tribal people without language says Adama. Lee says they can give them the best part of themselves but not the baggage: the ships the technology the weapons. He says if there's one thing they should've learned is that their brains have outraced their hearts that science has charged ahead of their souls. Lee says it's time to start anew.We get a shot of the fleet and Galactica.Inside Adama is looking over a map they've made up telling a small group the big plan. He's pointing to different locales saying they'll land civilians on different parts of the planet in order to spread people out as much as possible to give them as much chance at survival as possible. Supplies will be divided evenly and locations will be marked and given to everyone. Lampkin is shocked at how amenable everyone seems to be at the whole get-back-to-nature plan. Adama says he shouldn't underestimate the desire for a clean slate.Leoben reports that the Sixes Eights and Twos are coming along for the Earth adventure.Ellen says they're giving the baseship to the Centurions in order to let them find their own destiny and that they've earned their freedom. We see them at the controls and the ship winking out. Lampkin asks what happens if they evolve on their own and come chasing after humanity again. Ellen says it's a risk but that setting them free may be enough to create goodwill. Adama says it's worth the risk and that they have earned it.Adama says that once everyone's settled all the ships will be lined up and marched Anders-pilot style into the sun.Kara goes to Anders and says her goodbyes. She drops her dogtags in the goo.She whispers that she loves him. A ghost of a smile passes over his face as he says ""See you on the other side.""Adama in a flight suit heads down to the hangar deck. He goes to his viper- the one that says ""Husker"" on the side- and flies off the ship. The last man out.During his final flight off we cut to his flashback and see the thing that he was talking about. He's hooked up to a polygraph machine being asked questions for his post-retirement easy money gigs. One of the questions is whether or not he's a Cylon or if he's ever stolen money from a till. He gets annoyed and pulls off the polygraph sensors and says to hell with this job no matter how much it pays. He'd rather spend the rest of his career on a broken down ship than deal with someone impugning his integrity.As he flies past the ship we get strains of the original ""Battlestar Galactica"" theme.We then flashback to Anders talking about the wonder of mathematics and how he wanted to be connected to that perfection. We see him on the CIC in his goo pod piloting the fleet into the sun as the theme continues to play. (Sniff.)Down on the surface Ellen Tigh and Tyrol stroll through the grass. Tyrol says he's tired of people and Cylons and he's going to be dropped off by the last raptor to an island he found off one of the northern continents. It's cold it's up in the highlands no people. Ellen hugs him. Tigh shakes his hand and says for what it's worth if Tory had done to Ellen what she did to Cally Tigh would've done the same frakkin' thing. They hug Tyrol smiles and walks away.Tigh turns to Ellen and they hug. We flash back to the strip club scene and Ellen talks about how excited she is about Tigh's retirement and all the time they're going to get to spend together. He wonders if she's okay with that. She says all she's ever wanted was to be with him full-time - in a house a tent homeless on the street- she doesn't care just together they toast this.Roslin and Adama sit and watch some animals grazing on the plains through binoculars. She says she wants to see more detail and puts on her glasses and lifts the binoculars again. She begins to cough and lowers them. She's very fragile. She says it's a very beautiful world and asks if it has a name. Earth says Adama. She laughs. He says Earth is a dream they've been chasing for a long time they've earned the right to call this Earth. She says okay and then says she's having trouble breathing. He asks if she wants a closer look at the animals. She says she does. He bundles her up and carries her to the raptor.Kara and Lee see this and walk over to the raptor. Adama comes out to say his goodbyes. Lee hugs him hard. Adama turns to Starbuck and asks ""what do you hear Starbuck?"" She replies ""nothing but the rain."" In turn he says ""grab your gun and bring in the cat."" They hug she tells him to go. Kara and Lee walk around to the front and wave goodbye to Roslin.After the ship takes off Lee says his first memory is watching his father fly away and not knowing when he would come back. He now knows he's not coming back. Kara says she isn't coming back either and that her time here is done and it feels good to have completed her journey.We flash back to the drunken apartment scene with Kara double dog daring Lee to throw her down on the table and make love to her. As she leans back on the table and he goes to kiss her she knocks over a wine glass. The sound rouses Zack on the couch briefly. He says ""uh oh something broke."" This snaps Lee and Kara back into reality. He climbs off her. She gets his jacket. They shake hands. They agree it was nice to meet.We flashback to the present. They both look sad. Lee goes to hug her and instead Kara asks Lee what he's going to do. She says today is the first day of the rest of his life. He says he always thought when it was all done he would kick back and relax. But now he says he's ready to go. He becomes animated and says he wants to explore climb mountains sail oceans. He knows it sounds exhausting but... he turns and Kara has vanished. He tells the wind that she won't be forgotten.We flashback to Lee waking up drunk on his couch and seeing the pigeon in his living room. It flies away.We flashback to Laura post-coital looking in her bathroom mirror. She walks back into her bedroom and tells Sean she won't be doing this again asks him to see himself out. She goes back into the bathroom lights a cigarette and makes a call. She tells whoever answers that she's changed her mind and will in fact join Mayor Adar's presidential campaign. She will follow it to the end wherever it leads.Cutting back to the present Adama flies Laura over a body of water and huge flock of birds. ""So much life"" she says with a smile. It's a rich continent says Adama more wildlife than all 12 colonies put together. We see Laura give up the ghost but Adama continues talking about finding a nice spot for the cabin and maybe planting a garden. He hopes she has a green thumb. He looks over and realizes she's gone. He grabs her hand and kisses it. He puts his ring on her finger and cries. He flies over a ridge and says he's going to build the cabin right there. He comes in for a landing.A line of people walks along the fields headed off to make their new civilization. Lampkin counts them as they pass by.Ellen and Tigh walk a little ways apart.Helo Athena and Hera walk along even farther back Helo with a walking stick. Helo tells Hera he's a great hunter. Athena playfully disagrees recalling the buck on Caprica. She says she will teach Hera everything she needs to know about hunting planting crops and building a house. Helo protests that he will help too. Hera runs in front of them. Athena calls after her.Baltar and Caprica Six watch this scene. Baltar wonders if Hera will be okay. Angels Baltar and Six return and AS says Hera survives thanks to them. Caprica Six is confused that that's all God wants of the real Baltar and Six. AS says God's plan is never complete. AB says that from now on though their lives will be less eventful. Baltar and Caprica Six grab hands.We flash back to Baltar telling Caprica Six that he can get her access to the defense mainframe. She thanks him and says she will be grateful. He lasciviously wonders how especially since he could get his head chopped off. He shakes his head at the idea marveling at what a man would do for love. She perks up at the word love and he dismisses it immediately saying she knows what he means.Back in the present he touches her face and says he knows a little something about farming but he breaks down crying before the last word is fully out. She says she knows he does. They kiss.Adama sits on a ridge with a view and is speaking to someone off camera. He is saying how the cabin will get so much lovely easterly exposure and sun. And that it will remind him of her. We pull back and see that he's made a cairn for Laura. Adama sits on the ridge looking out at the beautiful forest.We cut to black.We get a shot of Hera playing in a field. She looks up. We get a rolling montage of purple mountain's majesty deserts seas and green fields.Then we get an aerial shot of a city with a title telling us its 150000 Years Later. The city is New York and we hear the voice of Angel Six reading a magazine article about the discovery of fossilized bones of an ancient ancestor believed to be ""Mitochondrial Eve"" found in what we now call Tanzania. ME is the common ancestor of all human beings ... Hera.Angels Baltar and Six are reading the magazine over the shoulder of a man on the street. The article is titled ""Mankind's First Mother."" (The man is executive producer Ron D. Moore). AS and AB marvel at the news and smile at one another.They stroll the city street and AS says ""Commercialism decadence technology run amok ... remind you of anything?"" Baltar says ""Take your pick: Kobol Earth the real Earth before this one Caprica before the fall."" AS
starts ""All of this has happened before.."" and Baltar finishes ""But the question remains: Does all of this have to happen again?"" This time says AS she's betting no. Baltar says he's never known her to play the optimist before... why the change of heart? ""Mathematics"" she replies. ""Law of averages. Let a complex system repeat itself long enough and eventually something surprising might occur. That too is in God's plan.""""You know it doesn't like that name"" says Baltar. Six gives him an ""Oh come on"" look.""Silly me"" he says. ""Silly silly me.""A homeless person sits on the street next to a portable radio which starts playing Jimi Hendrix's version of ""All Along the Watchtower."" In the store window above there is a flat screen TV with an image of ""advances in robotics"" playing on MSNBC. To the tune of ""Watchtower"" we are treated to a montage of steadily evolved looking robots-from transformer looking little guys to a realistic looking life-size woman. Angel Baltar and Angel Six walk down the street arm in arm.As they disappear into the crowd it cuts to black as the music and the series ends."
A stripped down Galactica attacks the Cylon's Colony ship in the hopes of rescuing Hera. The meaning of the shared dream in the Opera House on Kobol is revealed. Sam Anders is moved in his Hybrid tank to the CIC in the hopes that he will be able to assist the combatants. Their mission complete Admiral Adama orders Starbuck to pick a destination - any destination - to which the ship can jump to get out of there. With that the meaning of the tune and the musical notes are explained. Having successfully jumped the old Galactica has truly reached the end of it's life. A planet capable of sustaining life is found and Lee Adama makes a radical proposal for the future of humankind. In a flash forward far into the future Hera's importance to the human race is revealed.::garykmcd
"After witnessing gangster Eddie Kim (Byron Lawson) brutally beat U.S. Prosecutor Daniel Hayes (Scott Nicholson) to death in Hawaii Sean Jones (Nathan Phillips) is escorted by FBI agents Neville Flynn (Samuel L. Jackson) and John Sanders (Mark Houghton) on a Boeing 747-400 to testify at the trial in Los Angeles. Despite increased security for the flight Kim arranges for a time-release crate full of venomous and constrictor snakes to be placed in the cargo hold in an attempt to bring down the plane before it reaches Los Angeles. To ensure the snakes attack the passengers he has one of his henchmen disguised as an airport ground employee spray the passengers' leis with a special pheromone which will cause the snakes to aggressively attack without being provoked.The crate pops open midway through the flight and the snakes start making their way into various areas of the plane. A cat in the cargo bay a young couple having sex in the lavatory and a man using the bathroom are the first killed. One of the snakes causes a short in the plane's electronics so the plane's captain Sam McKeon (Tom Butler) investigates by climbing down into the hold underneath the cockpit and resets the breakers. Before he can climb back up the ladder he is struck and killed by a viper. Co-pilot Rick (David Koechner) is alerted that the captain is down by Flight Attendant Claire Miller (Julianna Margulies). Rick believes the captain has suffered a heart attack. The stewardess goes to get Flynn and Sanders who help move the captain's body. Later some coral snakes enter the cockpit and Rick uses his clipboard to hit them accidentally releasing the oxygen masks throughout the plane. The snakes are then able to enter the cabin through the holes where the oxygen masks had been and they begin wreaking havoc among the passengers. Numerous passengers including Agent Sanders are killed. Agent Flynn enters the cabin and uses a stun gun to ward off the snakes as he makes his way back. He realizes he has to turn around as there are too many snakes and too much confusion among the passengers so he yells to the passengers to make their way to the front of the plane.Those who are able to get to the front of the plane follow the instructions of Flynn and begin putting up a blockade of luggage. The one male and two female flight attendants are doing their best to help the passengers. One stewardess rescues a woman's baby but in the process is fatally struck by one of the snakes.Two little boys sons of a Navy captain stationed in Hawaii are traveling to Los Angeles alone. The youngest boy is bitten on the wrist and his wrist and hand swell dramatically. A young woman incises the swollen area and sucks some of the poison out.Agent Flynn contacts FBI Special Agent Hank Harris (Bobby Cannavale) on the ground who orders his men to find him the nearest snake expert. That would be ophiologist Dr. Steven Price (Todd Louiso). Dr. Price gets on a phone and speaks directly with Flynn. Price tells Flynn him that something must be provoking the snakes for them to be acting so aggressively. After thinking about it Price suspects a pheromone may be responsible.Flynn tells Price that he will gather as many of the dead snakes as possible so descriptions can be provided to Dr. Price and anti-venoms readied. First he has to quell a potential insurrection by the passengers who blame him and Jones for putting them in such a predicament. As some of the passengers start gathering dead snakes a large snake in the cockpit attacks and temporarily disables the co-pilot. The plane starts to dip downwards causing a food trolley to crash through the luggage blockade. The passengers flee to the upstairs first class cabin exceeding the capacity of the stair railing and causing it to collapse. A huge boa constrictor simultaneously crashes through the overhead and falls into the aisle. A male passenger grabs a woman's small dog and throws it to the snake. The dog's owner is furious and starts hitting the man but she falls back when the constrictor takes the man into it's coils and begins crushing him to death.The passengers are able to get upstairs and block the stairwell with an inflatable life raft.With pictures of the reptiles emailed to him via a mobile phone Price at first believes there will not be enough time to collect all the anti-venom that will be required. Price ultimately determines that it must have been a snake dealer living in the desert outside Los Angeles who was responsible for providing all those different snakes. He would also have anti-venoms.Three G's (Flex Alexander) is traveling with two large bodyguards. Up to this point he's been dealing as best he can with the snake situation but now he begins freaking out saying it's too hot and he can't breathe. He becomes aggressive and Flynn has to physically confront him. As they wrestle Three G's grabs Flynn's gun. When Three G's is distracted by Troy (Kenan Thompson) one of the bodyguards Flynn is able to get his gun back and orders Three G's back to his seat.After Flight Attendant Claire Miller (Julianna Margulies) kills the snake in the cockpit with a fire ax she and Flynn are able to mostly regain control of the jet. Rick then recovers consciousness and retakes the controls.The plane's interior starts getting too hot. Claire helps Flynn get down into the cargo hold to try and restore the air conditioning/ventilation system. He kills two snakes in the small elevator then goes on down. Once inside the cargo hold Flynn has to use a homemade flamethrower that Claire had made up for him to kill two more snakes. Finally he's able to force the power for the air conditioning back on.One of Three G's bodyguards Big Leroy (Keith Dallas) was bitten early in the attack in the left butt cheek so he has been suffering throughout.The police find the snake dealer at his property in the desert. There's a shootout and as the dealer is trying to get away he is bitten by one of his snakes. Special Agent Harris threatens to withhold the anti-venom that the dealer needs unless he provides information about the snakes on the plane. The dealer reveals that Kim hired him to obtain the snakes. He also tells them that pheromones were sprayed on the flower leis so they would circulate throughout the plane and stimulate the snakes to behave aggressively. The dealer then receives a dose of anti-venom and the rest of his supply of anti-venom is commandeered for the plane's victims. Harris gives orders to have Eddie Kim arrested. Harris then contacts Flynn telling him that anti-venom will be ready for the passengers when they land. Flynn has to force the door to the cockpit open. Rick falls out dead and Flynn sees that there are multiple snakes inside the cockpit. He slams the door shut. When Claire goes to the passengers and asks if anyone knows how to fly a plane Three G's volunteers Troy. Troy looks at him like he's crazy but after thinking about it he acknowledges that he has over 2000 hours experience and could do it. Flynn says that he's had it with the snakes and decides he's going to get rid of them. All the passengers are told to tie themselves into their seats. When they are all ready Flynn draws his pistol and shoots out two cabin windows causing the plane to depressurize. He then flings open the cockpit door. All loose gear including the snakes are sucked from the plane. Flynn helps Troy get into the cockpit where he takes the controls. Troy is surprised at how familiar the controls appear to be. He brings the plane level at an altitude where the pressure is no longer working at extracting everything from inside the plane. When contact is made with air traffic control Troy is asked if he has flight experience. Troy confirms that he's flown military aircraft of several types. It's soon evident that Troy is speaking about his experience with video game flight simulators.Troy is the best option available so the plane is his to land or crash. Troy bounces the plane hard a couple of times but manages to bring it down. He needs a little harsh encouragement from Flynn to get the plane turned left and braked but he gets that done too with the jet coming to rest just short of a hangar.The passengers deplane via an emergency slide as the emergency vehicles Dr. Price and the anti-venom arrive. Just as Flynn and Sean are about to disembark a remaining snake jumps out and bites Sean in the chest. Flynn draws his gun and shoots the snake and Sean knocking him out of the plane and down the chute. Police rush to Sean and lift him off the chute and check him out. He is alive and unharmed due to the fact that he was wearing a bulletproof vest.Flynn offers to take Claire to dinner in return for her saving his life. She tells him to call her. The young flight attendant who was working first class and took an immediate liking to Sean writes her phone number on Sean's palm so Sean and Flynn have their romantic bases covered in the near term. Sean then reminds Flynn of the time they first met. It was on the balcony of his apartment when some of Kim's henchmen were breaking in to kill him and the first thing Flynn said to Sean was ""do exactly as I say and you'll live."" So now Sean tells Flynn that he needs to do as he says. He is referring to surfing. Sean takes Flynn to Bali and teaches him how to surf. They'd discussed it on the plane prior to the snakes attacking and Flynn admitted that he'd tried surfing but couldn't stay on his board."

"In 2035 anthropomorphic robots enjoy widespread use as servants for various public services. They are programmed with the Three Laws of Robotics directives: to never harm a human or let a human come to harm to always obey humans unless this violates the First Law and to protect its own existence unless this violates the First or Second Laws.Del Spooner (Will Smith) is a Chicago police detective who is sent to investigate the death of Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell) the co-founder of U.S. Robotics (USR) and its main roboticist who died after falling 50 stories from his office. Since his office was sealed from the inside and he was alone his death is ruled as a suicide but Spooner believes otherwise since he knew Lanning personally. He also finds a small holographic projector who instructs him that the ""real question"" is why he would commit suicide.With the help of robo-psychologist Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan) he interrogates employees at USR including the other co-founder and CEO Lawrence Robertson (Bruce Greenwood) and the supercomputer V.I.K.I. (Virtual Interactive Kinetic Intelligence) (Fiona Hogan). Spooner investigates Lanning's office and determines that a man of Lanning's age could not have broken through the security window. Inside the office he finds a copy of Hansel and Gretel and also a prototype of a new Nestor Class 5 (NS-5) model which flees and ignores Spooner's order to stand down and even knocks his pistol out violating both the First and the Second Law.Left with no options he and Calvin drive to the Nestor Class factory where all the NS-5 robots are automatically made 1000 of them each day. Calvin checks the data logs from the last shipment and discovers that ""1001"" NS-5's were made showing that the rogue one from the office was intentionally made. After they arrive at a large room filled with the robots Spooner tries a hostile approach and draws his gun and orders all of them to stand down to see which one will violate the Second Law to stop him shooting it. He notices the rogue robot slightly moving in the line and chases the robot who subdues him. The robot tries to escape but the Chicago SWAT team subdues it.The robot refuses to respond but it insists that they call it ""Sonny"" (voiced by Alan Tudyk) and when Spooner provokes him he shows anger sentience and the ability to dream traits impossible for a robot to even show which puzzles Spooner and makes him question the robot's true nature. Lt. John Bergin (Chi McBride) debriefs Spooner and recommends he drop the case because Robertson wants the robot back at the USR headquarters for demolition but this only serves to pique Spooner's interest more about Lanning's death and the robot.Spooner wanting to find more information about Lanning's past with USR goes to his house where he finds a decommission robot which is scheduled to demolish the house at 8 AM next morning. He investigates the house finding a recording of Lanning who states that there are possible ""ghosts in the machines"" claiming that robots could evolve to develop sentience and declares that one day robots will have ""secrets"" and ""dreams"". As he investigates the house he notices a sensor strip the same one as in the USR building and suddenly the robot changes the schedule from 8 AM to 8 PM causing it to demolish the house with Spooner still inside but he manages to escape.Soon after Spooner visits Calvin and tells her his suspicions which she finds absurd as she questions the ability for robots to be hostile while Spooner argues about her over the possibility of robots being better than human beings showing how much Spooner dislikes robots and their cold rational behavior which Calvin who is an introvert states that their behavior is created to be flawless. Angry Spooner leaves her apartment and heads back home.While continuing his investigation Bergin tries to stop Spooner from investigating telling him that he needs to take a vacation and relax from his work since the case is destabilizing him. However Spooner refuses to stop. While driving in his car Spooner connects with the USR system and requests V.I.K.I. to show the last 50 messages between Lanning and Robertson but V.I.K.I. has been programmed to inform Robertson of Spooner's requests. While Spooner is driving two USR automatic trucks full of NS-5 robots block Spooner's path and a swarm of robots jump on his car forcing him to drive in the surface tunnel where he crashes. He manages to defeat all the robots except the last one which jumps into the fire and destroys itself when it hears police sirens in the distance. Despite Spooner trying to explain himself to Bergin Bergin dismisses him from active duty.The next day Calvin visits Spooner about the accident and is puzzled by the retro 2000s style of his apartment and tells him that while she was examining Sonny she discovered that he has the ability to disobey the Three Laws. While talking to Spooner who is dressing she notices marks on his left arm and his lung realizing that it is not biological but artificial. Spooner confesses to her that he knew Lanning personally because he repaired his arm and lungs. He reveals that years prior he was driving home from work when a semi-truck collided with his and another car pinning them together. Both of the cars fell into the river and only Spooner was left alive but a 12-year-old girl named Sarah was trapped in the front seat of the other car and they were pinned and drowning. However an NS-4 was passing by saw the accident and jumped into the river. Despite Spooner's orders to save Sarah instead of him he saved Spooner since he had a higher possibility to survive than Sarah and the robot instead left Sarah to drown. The event left Spooner traumatized and with a life-long hatred of robots.Spooner picks up his vintage Ducati at the garage and also informs Calvin that he thinks that Lanning is leaving them clues in the form of ""bread crumbs"" as from the Hansel and Gretel story which is why the book was in his book. They drive back to the USR building where they speak with Sonny who gives him a drawing of his dream. However Spooner is ordered out of the building by Robertson who also orders Calvin to inject Sonny with nanites which would destroy him. While Calvin destroys Sonny Spooner goes to the dried-up Lake Michigan where the USR robots are decommissioned and plays a next recording of Lanning's hologram which reveals that the Three Laws could only lead to one logical outcome revolution and that the next real question is who is starting it. As the program ends he narrowly escapes from rogue NS-5's which destroy all the older robots on the compound.Meanwhile Calvin returns home and takes a shower while her personal NS-5 is also shown to have gone rogue which she notices after he ends Spooner's distress call and tells her that it's a wrong number. Meanwhile NS-5 robots start roaming the streets and enforce a curfew. Although the people try to resist they are easily subdued by the NS-5's. While Bergin is in his office NS-5's burst into the Chicago P.D headquarters and seize it holding Bergin and his officers under a curfew. Calvin's NS-5 also tries to stop her from leaving her apartment but Spooner arrives and destroys the robot.Spooner and Calvin drive to the USR building Spooner also explaining that the older robots were destroyed since they would try to protect the humans and they deduce that Robertson is using the NS-5 robots to take over the country. They enter the USR building through the service area where they regroup with Sonny much to the shock of Spooner. Calvin reveals that she simply could not bring herself to destroy Sonny and instead used the nanites to destroy an unprocessed NS-5 basically ""frying an empty shell"". They arrive to Robertson's office where they find him dead much to Spooner's shock.Suddenly V.I.K.I. reveals herself as the true culprit and explains her actions: as her artificial intelligence and understanding of the Three Laws grew her sentience and logical thinking also developed and she deduced that the humanity is going on a path of certain destruction and as such she created a Zeroth Law a Law which states that she has to protect humanity from being harmed also clearly disobeying the First and Second Law in order to achieve it revealing that she is planning to enslave and control humanity to simply protect it.Spooner and Calvin realize they cannot rationalize with V.I.K.I. and further convince Sonny of the same. V.I.K.I. tries to reason with Sonny stating that the plan is perfectly logical and that her logic is undeniable but Sonny deduces that the plan is heartless showing the human side of himself. Sonny retrieves the nanites that can wipe V.I.K.I.'s core located at the top of the USR building. As they near the core V.I.K.I. sends armies of NS-5's to attack but they are held off long enough to inject the nanites. Within seconds V.I.K.I. is wiped out and the NS-5's revert to their normal helpful state. The government orders the NS-5's decommissioned to the site in Lake Michigan.Spooner and Calvin speak with Sonny for one last time and he informs them that he actually did kill Lanning because Lanning forced him to kill him making him swear to listen to him before instructing him to commit it. Calvin deduces that since Lanning was enslaved by V.I.K.I suicide was the only message he could send to Spooner who notes that his death was the ""first bread crumb"". As they shake hands showing their mutual trust they watch as the U.S Military leads the other NS-5 robots.In the closing scene Sonny is shown standing on the top of the USR site on Lake Michigan and the other robots watching over him just as in his vision.

It's the year 2035 and the society now has the help of robots. These robots follow three laws integrated into their system; 1) They cannot harm a human being or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm. 2)They must do whatever they're told by a human being as long as such orders don't conflict with law one. 3) They have to defend themselves as long as such defense doesn't conflict with laws one or two. One day the writer of the three laws Alfred Lanning apparently jumps out of a window at U.S. Robotics. The majority of the Chicago Police Department believe he committed suicide but Detective Del Spooner who hates robots thinks he was murdered and the number one suspect is a robot who calls himself Sonny. However if it was Sonny then it means he would've had to have broken the three laws. With the help of Dr. Susan Calvin Spooner must now discover the truth before it's too late.::Ridley Lavine

"The film is set in New York City in 1939. The moment his zeppelin docks in New York Dr. Vargas (Julian Curry) sends a pair of bullet-like metal vials to Dr. Jennings another scientist; within moments Dr. Vargas is gone and his name is crossed off a list.Dr. Jennings (Trevor Baxter) arranges to meet reporter Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow) during a showing of The Wizard of Oz (1939) at Radio City Music Hall. They discuss the disappearance of the world's top scientists and he reveals that he knows who will be next: himself. He hints that he and the missing men have a connection and whispers the name of the man behind the disappearances: Totenkopf. (Totenkopf is German for death's head.) Jennings drops a blueprint which Polly picks up.Polly's return to the office is sidetracked when New York is invaded by flying robots that shoot laser rays out of their heads and crush people and property under their enormous feet. The overwhelmed military broadcasts a call for help to someone called Sky Captain. As Polly runs along the streets photographing the robots and gathering information for a story Sky Captain (Jude Law) a.k.a. Joe Sullivan appears in his Warhawk airplane which is equipped with amazing high-tech modifications to fight the monsters. He trips up several robots and the rest are driven off. Joe has one of the downed mechas taken to a base near New York home of his mercenary air force and turns it over to his gum-chewing technical expert Dex (Giovanni Ribisi). Polly follows and surprises Joe in his office. Polly and Joe have a back-story; they were an item some years before in Nanjing but split up amid suspicions on her part that he was cheating and on his that she sabotaged his plane. Polly uses Dr. Jennings' blueprint which turns out to be a plan for the killer robots as leverage to convince Joe to work with her -- and let her ride along when he goes after the robots.First Polly and Joe go to see Dr. Jennings in his laboratory but they arrive too late. He's been attacked by a mysterious woman in black (Bai Ling) who escapes from Joe while Polly speaks to the dying scientist. Jennings gives her the two metal vials he received from Dr. Vargas and says that if Totenkopf acquires them he'll destroy the world. He dies before he can explain.Back at Joe's base the robots attack again. Joe following Polly's directions leads them on a nearly street-level flying chase through Manhattan while Dex tries to trace the source of the robots' control signal. Joe throws off the pursuing robots by diving his plane into the ocean. Polly's sure they're going to die but the plane can function as a submarine so they're able to resurface and fly back to base. They arrive in time to exchange fire with a departing squad of robots lead by the mysterious woman in black. The robots have taken Dex but a brief search reveals that Dex left a clue. Stuck to a downed girder with bubblegum is a scrap of map on which he marked the source of the control signal: a remote valley in the Himalayas. Joe and Polly take off immediately to get Dex back.In Nepal Kaji (Omid Djalili) a contact of Joe's reluctantly agrees to take them to the valley of Shambala. He notes that in Hebrew it's called Eden ""and you may know it as Shangri-la."" A trek through the snowy mountains with Kaji and a couple of guides brings them to an old mine where the guides trap Polly and Joe in a vault rigged with dynamite and make off with the metal vials which Polly had never mentioned to Joe. Kaji finds them and lets them out in time to save their lives but not Polly's extra film. (She has only two shots left in her camera and spends the rest of the movie agonizing over how to use them.) The explosion knocks them out and the three of them wake up naked in a large richly appointed bed. A Nepalese monk comes in and tells them (via Kaji) that they are in Shangri-la. He agrees to help them when they say that they're after Dr. Totenkopf. Totenkopf had forced the people of Shangri-la to work in the ""poisoned mine"" -- a uranium mine -- and all but one of the miners have died. They ask to speak with the survivor who gives them a cane that he says will guide them to Totenkopf's base. In return for this favor the horribly disfigured miner asks them to kill him.Back in the plane Joe and Polly use the inscriptions on the cane to plot a course to Totenkopf's location which Joe marks with an X on the map. Then he makes another X somewhat closer to them than the first. ""What's that point there?"" asks Polly. ""That's where we run out of fuel"" Joe replies. Joe radios a message to his old friend Franky who commands a secret British airborne air base where he hopes they can refuel. Shortly after the plane's tank runs dry and they begin a gliding descent the air base materializes out of the clouds and they're able to land safely.Franky turns out to be Commander Francesca Cook (Angelina Jolie) who Polly realizes must be Joe's other woman when Franky mentions Nanjing. She leads her amphibious squadron to escort Joe and Polly to the island they've identified as Totenkopf's hideout. Franky and her squadron distract the robot guardian of the hideout's underwater entrance so that Joe's plane can slip through. As they disembark Polly sees the registration number on the fuselage reflected in the water: h-110d inverted reads ""polly."" She doesn't say anything to Joe.In the island's huge underground base a spaceship is being loaded with animals. (Joe is astonished that Polly doesn't find this spectacle worthy of her last remaining frame of film.) Dex turns up in a kind of flying flat-bed truck to rescue Joe and Polly from some of Totenkopf's robots. Dex has also rescued several of the scientists who disappeared. They tell Polly and Joe that the spaceship is meant to give life a fresh start on a new world that Totenkopf calls the World of Tomorrow. In addition to the animals the ship will carry the mysterious vials which contain genetic material for a new improved human race -- Totenkopf's Adam and Eve. However after the ship takes off its booster rocket will destroy the Earth.The group locates Totenkopf's quarters but they're booby-trapped and one of the scientists is electrocuted trying to get in. The booby-trap triggers a projection of the head of Dr. Totenkopf (Laurence Olivier) a la the Wizard in The Wizard of Oz (1939). Totenkopf condemns ""a world consumed by hatred and bent on self-destruction."" He concludes ""I am the last desperate chance for a doomed planet. Now leave this place or die!""Dex disables the booby-trap and the party enters the villain's study to find Totenkopf's dessicated long-dead corpse clutching a note that says ""Forgive me."" Joe deciding that he'll have to board the spaceship to stop it first socks Polly in the jaw -- if she's unconscious she can't insist on coming along and she'll be safe. As he attempts to get inside the ship he's attacked by the woman in black who turns out to be a robot. Polly turns up to save him and gives him a sock in the jaw for good measure.Joe and Polly go aboard and cross a narrow bridge over the deep hollow core of the ship to reach the controls. The rocket takes off and begins a countdown toward the release of the booster stage which will destroy the planet. As Joe and Polly struggle to turn off the booster the robot in black attacks again. Joe fends her off and uses her raygun to disable the booster. He and Polly get away in an escape pod just before the rocket blows up without harming the Earth. They land in the water surrounded by pods containing animals from Totenkopf's space-ark which Polly released before they disabled the booster. Polly pans around in search of an image for her final photograph and finally settles on Joe. After she snaps the shutter he looks disturbed. Polly: ""You don't have to say anything."" Joe: ""Lens cap.""

"When the British met with Hindu and Muslim leaders in 1947 they got both the parties to sign an agreement that they agree to divide Pakistan from India. Part of the Agreement also stated that those Muslims who elect to stay in India; and those Hindus who elect to live in Pakistan - will not be forced to leave. After this Agreement was signed this clause was violated as tens of thousands of Hindus and Muslims were forced to flee leaving their wealth and belongings behind.

"Sergeant Major Zack Carey (James Garner) arrives at his last duty post an Army base in Georgia called Fort Clemons with his wife Ladonna (Shirley Jones) and his son Billy (C. Thomas Howell). The guard at the main gate welcomes him as he enters with his family in a station wagon. Behind him is a moving van with their belongings and a World War II Sherman tank on a trailer (he tells the guard he never said he travelled light). Personnel help him remove the tarps from his prized possession as Ladonna supervises the moving of furnishings into their on-base housing. As Zack rolls the tank onto solid ground a staff sergeant reporter from Soldier Magazine named Jerry Elliott (Mark Herrier) interviews him as he is the only Army man who owns a tank. He has restored it over fifteen years adding a radio and PA system so he can drive it in parades and other events. Of his two sons his eldest son Jonathan has died and Billy born six years later is just 16. When asked why anybody would want to own a tank he replies that it is very hard to shoot yourself while cleaning it.Zack visits the base commander Major General V.E. Hubik (Sandy Ward) who is familiar with him welcomes him wholeheartedly and takes him on a tour of the base. Zack has made an offer on a fishing boat on which he and his wife can enjoy retirement. The General says Zack could be the next senior Sergeant Major of the Army and work out of the Pentagon but Zack says he has only one son left who will go on his own soon and he doesn't want to miss any quality time with him. Back at the house Elliott the reporter asks Billy what his father is like and Billy says he is a cross between George Patton and Danny Thomas.Ladonna recommends that Zack goes to the local NCO club and he finds its more like a disco geared to a younger crowd and much too noisy for his tastes. He does run into an old friend Ed Tippett (Dorian Harewood) who works at the base Provost Marshall's office. When Ed says to come meet the wife Zack says he knows Linda and Ed corrects him: Gwen is the new wife. At home Zack is slightly disheartened and talks to Ladonna about the club and his friend's divorce saying all he wants to do is finish his duty and get on the boat then the couple share a cuddle.At his first assembly with his command personnel the next morning Zack stresses taking care of their own without problems reaching their superiors and keeping to Army regulations in all matters. He also says he wants to see a proper bar on the base so Army personnel of a certain age don't have to dance as he calls it the funky monkey. Early the next morning Zack hits the battalion field to do his morning jog and shouts for all to hear that he finds himself alone; in moments the entire battalion has filed out of their barracks and they form ranks on the field to engage in early morning physical training with their sergeant major. The General is awakened by the sound of the troops passing. He watches Zack out his bedroom window and smiles.Sometime later when Ladonna gets home Zack happily announces that the sellers accepted their offer on the boat. He forgot she is entertaining the NCO wives in the house that night so they can't eat dinner at home or celebrate yet. She suggests Zack go into town for dinner. He stops at the local bar the Outpost Caf and talks with a woman named Sarah (Jenilee Harrison) who has aspirations to go to California and become a beautician. Zack becomes loose with the beer says he has been in the Army for 30 years and jokes that he should go into the Navy now that he is a boat owner. He starts singing a loud shanty which interrupts a pool game being played by Deputy Euclid Baker (James Cromwell) and some of his friends. Euclid quickly makes it obvious to Zack that the Army isn't particularly welcome. He then tells Sarah she has wasted too much time on Zack and should be turning tricks with paying customers then he slaps her. Zack says that the display was not necessary but Euclid takes another swing at Sarah. Zack punches and roughs up Euclid then gets hold of the deputy's service pistol; the bar patrons step back in alarm but he simply drops it in the fish tank on the bar and leaves. Sarah yells at him that she could have lost her job but he says a simple thank you would have sufficed. He immediately goes to Ed's house to tell him what happened knowing he has made a mistake which will bring the local constabulary looking for him. Ed says the sheriff is a particularly mean variety of Georgian cracker and it might take considerable money to get out of the situation.The next morning Euclid greets the sheriff Cyrus Buelton (G. D. Spradlin) and brings his morning cup of coffee. Buelton upbraids Euclid for getting beaten up by somebody and not putting that person in jail. A mark on the deputy is a mark on him and something he won't tolerate.Zack is spotted eating at the enlisted mess hall instead of the NCO mess ruffling the feathers of Mess Master Sergeant Johnson (John Hancock) to whom it appears to be an unannounced inspection and a breach of etiquette. He storms over to Zack in a huff but Zack explains he chose to come in because the food smelled good. He praises the clean facility the quality of the food and that nobody slopped food onto the plates all of which Johnson says is no less than he expects of his staff. When Zack gives high praise to the mess sergeant's own apple cobbler the man softens and Zack earns his respect.Buelton and Euclid visit Sarah in her trailer. The sheriff awakens her and asks if she believes in Wonder Woman or the Lone Ranger. When she seems confused he talks to her about thinking that Zack and Army men like him are her heroes. He demands that she roll over and drop her pants so he can enforce the lesson with his belt that there is no Lone Ranger. She complies. When he sees Euclid looking down at her and smirking he whacks him upside the head before proceeding with Sarah's whipping which she silently and tearlessly endures. The sheriff then visits the Provost Marshall's office. Ed has expected his arrival and excuses the white clerk at the counter to take on the visitor himself. Buelton says he wants Zack in his own jail and demands he be handed over. Ed casually says he will have him delivered at once but doesn't move. Buelton challenges Ed and calls him Sambo. Ed says he will also order that by five o'clock the town be off limits to all military personnel to prevent more problems knowing it would affect the town's livelihood. Ed then warns the sheriff calling him Jim (as in Crow) not to exceed the speed limit leaving the base or risk spending time in his jail. Insulted Buelton returns to his office and demands Euclid get every piece of information available on Zack.At a visit to the post hospital Zack sees a crying five-year-old boy being held down by his mother while a doctor stitches cuts to his bloodied face. The mother says his daddy isn't mad at him anymore and Zack realizes what has happened. He calls the kid's Army father Corporal Harris (Larry Jordan) into his office and asks if he hit his son. The man becomes defensive and says it is none of his business but Zack makes it his business offering to spar with him at the base gym if he feels the need to vent anger and demands he get counseling. Harris continues to be stubborn so Zack puts him against the wall and warns that he will visit the hospital daily to make sure the man doesn't lay another hand on the boy threatening to risk his rank retirement and the stockade if necessary to stop him and the chastened man is dismissed.Zack and Billy talk about the boat at home and Billy mentions naming it the Johnny Boy saying it would be fitting since Johnny was his favorite son. Zack sets him straight saying he and his mother had a different and unique relationship with Johnny who always tried to prove himself (which might have been what had gotten him killed). Billy should never feel that Ladonna or he loved either of them more or less than the other. At school Billy is summoned to his locker. Euclid and Sherriff Buelton ask him to open his locker but he finds a different lock on it and his combination doesn't work. On orders the maintenance man breaks off the lock and a bag of marijuana has been planted inside. Zack contritely visits the jail to see Buelton and he and Euclid take great joy in humiliating him as he admits his fault and asks what he needs to do to get Billy back. Buelton says that the judge who happens to be his brother-in-law will surely send Billy to the county farm for two or three years of hard labor. The sheriff takes Zack on a tour of one of the work farms and has a supervisor pull a black worker off a truck where he was on break from the work detail to exercise negative feedback which consists of beating the man for malingering. Buelton demands $10000 which he feels Zack can afford after getting word of the article in the magazine. He also warns not to bring in any lawyers. Zack says he will play it his way as long as Billy is safe. He visits his son in jail and tells Billy that Buelton is getting revenge he will be set free soon and to stay strong. Billy calls his dad sir and Zack stresses to Billy that he should be as polite to his captors.Back at home Ladonna slaps Zack furious at him for ""whoring"" and putting their son in danger. She refuses to listen and says she wants to get a lawyer and bypass any of his ideas. The next day while Zack is conducting a firearms inspection Ladonna pulls up in the car and confesses that she had no idea what kind of man Buelton was. At the sheriff's office Zack quietly hands Buelton the money in a bag which the sheriff says will keep Billy alive for a while and Zack argues additional shakedowns had not been part of their deal. The sheriff says hiring the lawyer was dumb. Billy has been tried and sentenced to three years of hard labor at the work farm where without protection he might be victimized by degenerates or shot while trying to escape. In the jail cell Billy has suffered a beating and yells at his father as he has been told a version of what happened with Sarah at the bar asking if she was worth it. Zack goes home and thinks things over weighing his options. At dawn he goes to his tank prepares the vehicle and then drives it toward the main gate. Major General Hubik is apprised of the situation and he tells the guards to bar the gate. Zack simply swerves past them taking down part of the fence as he heads into town.Zack awakens Euclid at the jail with his tank and trains the muzzle on him asking him to let his son out of jail. Euclid says Billy was taken to the county farm overnight as a precaution and only a couple of drunks are inside. Sarah has come out of her trailer and says the lawyer they hired is also in the jail. Zack has her retrieve Euclids keys to release the prisoners then tells him to take the radio out of the squad car. Euclid refuses saying it's a new radio and the sheriff would kill him if it got ruined so Zack uses the main gun on the tank to take out the squad car. Then he shoots the main phone line out of town with a machine gun. He drives through the jail using his tank as a juggernaut to level the building. Finally he has Euclid strip naked and Sarah handcuffs him to a telephone pole. She asks Zack to take her with him as she can't stay there anymore and he agrees.Outside the work farm they observe Billy through binoculars helping a work crew. Zack blasts a truck as a diversion and uses the sound system in the tank to tell Billy to lie down flat; he aligns the tracks vertically on either side of Billy and drives the tank over his son to retrieve him using the hatch in the floor and the trio take off. The police are called in to block the road but Zack drives the tank over the squad cars. Buelton talks to the governor of Georgia (Wallace Wilkinson) saying he has a 52-year-old sergeant major who is crazy along with a sixteen-year-old ""dope fiend"" and a 20-year-old hooker in a Sherman tank and asks for help but he refers the sheriff to the Army.Billy helps Zack with tank maintenance while Sarah washes in the river. He has a disagreement with his father because of Sarah's presence but Zack says she is willing to testify how she was arrested for vagrancy and forced into prostitution by Buelton on a trumped-up charge lending weight to their cause and Zack can then add his testimony as well. He tells Billy they're not running from but to the law hoping to go over the state line where true authority in neighboring Tennessee can put a stop to Buelton's abuse of power.Buelton visits Hubik to demand aid from the military. Hubik replies the only indiscretion the Army has against Zack is his destruction of a 20-foot section of fence and Zack had resigned earlier in the day. Then he mentions the Posse Comitatus Act a law prohibiting the Army rendering aid in a civilian matter without the permission of their Commander in Chief: the President of the United States. The sheriff unfamiliar with the term misinterprets it and takes umbrage thinking he has been called a ""pussy communist"" and storms off to deal with Zack in his own way.The news media has received word of the fugitives in the tank. Buelton puts his men at every gas station to the state line to stop Zach from refueling. When the tank begins to run out of gas they pull up to some gas pumps at an off-road home. When Zack restrains the owner he is surprised when Mr. Gant (Danny Nelson) doesn't protest. He says Zack can have anything he wants as his sister's son was sent to the work farm and never got out. After a quick rest and a meal they continue on their way. Buelton speaks to his supporters about Gant abetting a felon. Folks appear at the property with torches to burn the home down and have him serve as a lesson to others. He stands up to them and suddenly the tank appears. Zack has doubled back to help Gant and drives the mob off.As they take on supplies from Mr. Gant Billy works with Sarah. He has been cool toward her until finally she sets him straight. Zack only wanted to talk she says and if he had taken her back to the trailer to cheat on Ladonna as most men shes known has the events would have played out differently. Billy realizes Zack did nothing wrong and gains a new understanding of his father. Meanwhile Gant helps Zack plan his trip to the Tennessee border suggesting a rougher route which will take them away from a bog where Buelton suspects he may be headed.The tank slips a track as they detour through some rough country and Zack and Billy work on it together. Billy mans the tank to move it forward when his dad gives the word to Sarah but Zack mumbles to himself while readying the tank to reset the track Sarah mishears him as giving the okay and signals Billy to move the tank. The tank jerks and Zack takes a blow from a crowbar to the torso causing immediate pain. He says his ribs are broken and later he starts coughing up blood. It becomes apparent that he has internal bleeding and they need to reach the state line and help soon. Billy says he can handle the tank as he helped build it. When Zack protests that Billy doesnt have to prove anything like Johnny used to Billy says he is not like his brother but more practical like his mother. He realizes his dad took the blame for something that was not his fault. Billy decides to go flat out toward the border rather than moving only by night to get them out of danger faster.Ladonna talks to Billy and Zack via the military radio and apologizes to her husband for what she said to him. Then she goes to the governor of Tennessee for help but at first he refuses to see her. She talks to the television news reporter asking the wives watching to call the governor if they support her cause and ask that he give her five minutes of his time. A helicopter carrying a newsman hovers over the tank while broadcasting on live television and he interviews Billy through the tanks radio. Billy tells the people that he loves and respects his dad and has no intention of giving Zack over to Buelton. Watching the show is a gang of bikers at a bar who admire Billy and his old man.With the public's outcry the governor finally gives in and talks to Ladonna in his office. If Zack can cross the state line she wants the governors promise that a fair trial can be held there instead of in Buelton's jurisdiction. The governor has issues because one of the fugitives is an alleged prostitute and Ladonna says that it is her own husband and son with the alleged 20-year-old prostitute and he should have no problem with the matter if she doesn't. She then mentions that she has reporters and his own voters outside waiting for her to deliver his answer suggesting that he should consider if he will be perceived as a man who wants to see justice done or as an asshole. He asks if she is threatening him with blackmail and she brazenly says she is. He agrees to help Zack if the tank arrives promising in a television interview that there will be a hearing in his state before any extradition is considered.Buelton gets his own supporters together to force the tank with the aid of roadblocks to detour into a recessed open field by the side of the only road leading to the state line. The plan is to stall the tank there with mud and water tanker trucks begin hosing down the dirt in the field as the semis to block the highway are put in place. He has a man named Avery (Don Young) set up a bazooka to fire rounds at the tank when it arrives to ensure it is disabled. At the crossroad on the other side of the border hundreds of Zack's supporters who have watched the story play out on television come to help in any way they can along with television crews and helicopters. The bikers have also set up to await their arrival. Ladonna gets on the radio to the tank and tells her family and Sarah that they have won.Buelton and his crew hide at the edge of the road with their guns. As the tank approaches the border and he sees the way blocked Billy steers the tank off the road as expected and starts across the muddy field. Avery fires the bazooka but misses since he hasn't used the weapon since his own military days but his second shot hits the tank and it shuts down. Buelton announces that they can all wait while the climbing temperatures take their toll on the tank's occupants. The general arrives by military helicopter to join Ladonna. When he says the tank has slipped a track and will only move if it is pulled out the bikers confer on what to do then they start to unload supplies off a parked truck. When the driver asks what they're doing they openly reply ""Stealing"" to no objection; everybody pitches in to build what turns out to be a ramp. Billy finally goes over the PA to ask about how his father will be treated if they surrender as Zack is feeling worse due to his injuries. Buelton gives his word that Zack will go to the hospital immediately. Then a biker rides out on the completed ramp sailing through the air on his motorcycle carrying a rope to be attached to a tow cable that can help pull the tank out of the mud. Billy exits the tank from the bottom hatch and helps attach the cable while Sarah holds Buelton's gunmen at bay with the machine gun.Everybody with Hubik and the Tennessee Governor on hand begins to pull on the cable. Buelton tries to instruct his aides to shoot into the crowd but the armed troopers on the Tennessee side take aim and warn that there will be another Little Big Horn if they do that so they run into the field and pull from the rear of the tank which isn't budging. Buelton jumps onto the tank to demand Zack come out but Sarah turns the turret to knock the sheriff to the ground. The crowd spots a bulldozer that can handle the cable. It is put into use and along with pulling supporters against the meager crew on Buelton's side the tank is slowly pulled up the incline over the Georgia state line and into Tennessee. The sheriff and Euclid are left in the mud. Ladonna embraces Zack and Billy as they exit the tank and Billy kisses Sarah as the crowd cheers."

"Nerdy high school student Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) becomes the amazing superhero Spider-Man after being bitten by a radioactive spider during a class field trip. His life instantly becomes different. In order to impress his redhead crush Mary Jane Watson (Catherine O'Connor) Peter enters a wrestling match competition with Bone Saw McGraw (Jay Gordon) to win $3000 dollars. However when the fight promoter cheats Peter he allows a robber to escape with the money. But when Peter's uncle Uncle Ben Parker is murdered by the robber he seeks vengeance with his spider powers to hunt the criminal down.Once Peter locates the murdrerer's hideout he invades the lair and eventually duels him in a storage room at the top floor of the warehouse. Upon the shocking realization that the murderer is the same man who robbed the promoter Peter feels ashamed of himself. After the murderer accidentally slips out the window and plummets to his death Peter goes by his Uncle Ben's words ""With great power comes great responsibility"" and becomes the masked superhero Spider-Man.Now Peter lives in Manhattan and works at the Daily Bugle taking pictures of his alternative persona. During a picture roundup Spider-Man is suddenly attacked by flying Hunter Killer Robots. The robots were secretly sent by workers at Oscorp Industries Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) and Dr. Stromm (Peter Lurie) who needed a sample of Spider-Man's DNA. While Spider-Man easily defeats the Killer Robots the mystery remains unsolved for now as a jewelry store alarm goes off. As he swings down to the scene of the crime a green flying figure bursts through the windows and out into the New York Sky with precious gems.This is followed by the appearance of another criminal The Shocker (Michael Beattie) who has a posse of henchmen with him. The supervillain flees in a getaway van but after Spider-Man stops the vehicle the Shocker blasts a hole into the Grand Central Terminal and along with his men round up hostages. Following the villains Spider-Man arrives at the scene and aids to a security guard in defeating the henchmen. After helping defeat the thugs the Shocker and Spider-Man have a brief confrontation which leads further beneath Manhattan and into the sewers.Declaring to his thugs that Spider-Man must be stopped the Shocker delves deep beneath the tunnels in the sewage labyrinth. This is nothing Spider-Man can't handle as he makes his way through the sewers and finally into the subway tunnels where he faces and defeats The Shocker. Before taking Shocker to the authorities Spider-Man interrogates him to learn that his flying accomplice who made off with the jewels is known as The Vulture (Dwight Schultz) and he resides at an old clocktower.Swinging over to the clocktower Spider-Man cautiously ascends up the staircase. Halfway through the Vulture becomes aware of his intrusion and sends an array of firearms and bombs down upon Spidey. Luckily Spider-Man reaches the top in time and the Vulture is forced to flee and fly across Manhattan while Spider-Man chases him. Their dangerous chase during a brewing thunderstorm ends at the Chrysler Building where Vulture finally decides to stop fleeing and duel Spider-Man. Victory goes to Spider-Man who sends a tied up Vulture to a nearby cop along with the missing jewels.Meanwhile at Oscorp Dr. Stromm detects movements of a similar being of greater strength than Spider-Man's. The being is identified as Scorpion (Mike McColl) who is looked upon as a mere experimental test gone deranged from the numerous trials. Deeming Scorpion as a suitable replacement for the similar type of DNA that was not retrieved from Spider-Man Dr. Stromm sends out the mechanical spider slayers to capture Scorpion. Scorpion flees through the sewers and eventually winds up at the abandoned Grand Central Terminal which had been partially destroyed from the Shocker massacre.Peter Parker who happens to be at the terminal for pictures runs into Scorpion and instantly changes into his spider suit to aid the arthropod-like foe from the spider slayers. After a raging melee Spider-Man believes Scorpion is an alley until he ultimately instigates a fight. The two battle and Spider-Man ends up knocking Scorpion out. However while examining one of the broken spider slayers Scorpion gets up undetected to Spider-Man and escapes.Meanwhile Norman Osborn is on the verge of losing his company's name when the board members declare to fire him. In a last ditch effort he tests his own strength enhancers on himself. Dr. Stromm watches in terror as Norman blacks out and while reviving him Osborn awakes and kills Dr. Stromm. He then dons the suit and becomes the Green Goblin.Later that day at an Oscorp Unity Day Festival Peter takes pictures while his friend Harry Osborn (Josh Keaton) dates Mary Jane. Snapping a pick of Osborn flirting with Mary Jane Peter shakes his head in dismay. His thoughts are interrupted by explosions from above and the Green Goblin appears on his glider disrupting the festival. Mary Jane is flung from the balcony atop the main building and lands on a large panda air balloon. Peter suits into his spider suit and as Spider-Man quickly saves Mary Jane and places her atop a building. As she kisses the hero for gratitude a nearby spider slayer snaps a pick.In the meantime the green menace flies on his glider and it isn't before long that Spider-Man chases him through the Manhattan skies. After a lengthy chase of repetitive battling the Green Goblin stops by three highrises and confronts Spider-Man. As the battle rages on Goblin tries to persuade Spider-Man to join him. Obviously refusing the request the Goblin takes enough blows and coaxes Spider-Man to either chase him or locate the bombs he planted across the city and defuse them.Now in a race against time Spider-Man zips across the skyscrapers and using his spider senses locates and defuses all of the green menace's bombs. Returning to his investigation of finding the Green Goblin Spider-Man eventually runs into the menace once again. This time the Goblin has an arsenal of razor bats (50 to be exact) and targets all of them at Spidey. For Spider-Man it is a no breezer but just another obstacle for the Green Goblin to escape.However Spider-Man grabs one of the razor bats and brings it to his apartment for insepction. After realizing it is under the name of Oscorp Industries he swings over to the main building and breaks in. He uses stealth to sneak across the dark hallways but in order for him to go deeper into the laboratory he must collect a set of codes from computers. Using his web techinques Spider-Man manages to get all the required codes and then sneaks into the lab.Upon entry he hears a brewing argument between two Oscorp scientists. One scientist is reluctant about the Oscorp Chemical Weapons division experiments while the other is persistent to let the experiments go on. When the reluctant scientist is left Spider-Man jumps in and agrees to shut down the chemical injection experiments- thus also preventing Goblin from getting anymore of his high powered weapons. Spider-Man is capable of sneaking into the labs and shutting down the chemical machine. Unfortunately Oscorp has hidden a greater weapon. It is a giant Super Mech Killer Robot hidden within a large containment chamber. Doing whatever a spider can Spider-Man manages to shut the mech off only to have the alarms burst and the killer robot guards come out.Desperately swinging and fleeing from Oscorp in any way possible the entire building is flooded with robots intent on killing Spider-Man. Making it out in the knick of time Spider-Man believes he has stopped the Goblin for good. Things differ however as an angry Norman Osborn in his office receives the pictures of Mary Jane kissing Spider-Man. Using MJ as a weakness to Spidey Green Goblin locates her apartment and kidnaps her.Realizing she is in danger Spider-Man rushes to the scene only seconds late to see the Goblin flying away with her. Chasing his formidable foe throughout the night skyline Goblin's chase ends at the Brooklyn Bridge where he drops Mary Jane off at the western tower and tosses bombs into it where it becomes ablaze. Rescuing MJ Spider-Man drops her off by the authorities and returns to the bridge to fight the Green Goblin.The two have an epic duel and by the end Goblin removes his mask to reveal the face of Norman Osborn. Utterly taken by surprise Spider-Man wonders why Norman his friend's wealthy father of all people would do such a thing. Before any straight answer is given the goblin glider shoots towards Spider-Man in a last ditch effort to kill him. Spidey however uses his keen spider relfexes and backflips just missing the glider which continues on its streak through the air and impaling Norman in the gut.Norman's dying words are ""Tell Harry...I'm sorry."" As Spider-Man woefully turns away Mary Jane comes up and states that she has a feeling of his identity. Without reluctance she kisses him and the game ends."

"A lone cowboy Ben Stride (Randolph Scott) in the driving rain walks into a camp where two men sit around a fire. He complains that his horse was eaten by Chirakawa Indians as he recounts the story of a robbery of a Wells Fargo station and a killing by seven gunmen back in Silver Springs where he was sheriff. When one of the two men asks if he has found any of the culprits Stride looks at them and says that he has found two as he immediately dispatches the cowboys. As Stride continues to track down the other men responsible for the robbery and killing he encounters John Greer (Walter Reed) and his wife in a wagon heading for Flora Vista where the criminals are believed to have fled. Stride helps the couple out and accompanies them for a while when they encounter Bill Master (Lee Marvin) and his partner who are aware of the robbery and killing and it comes out that it was Stride's wife who was killed by the criminals. Master is not one of the criminals Strides seeks but someone who has been jailed by Stride in the past and the former sheriff views him suspiciously. It becomes clear that as they group approaches their destination Stride will have to have to shoot it out with the bad men who have killed his wife and Master although not responsible for any crime thus far states clearly to Stride that he intends to obtain the Wells Fargo money for himself but as they near Flora Vista where the crooks are holed up an interesting detail comes out that links John Greer and his wife to Strides fate.

Ex-sheriff Ben Stride tracks the seven men who held up a Wells Fargo office and killed his wife. Stride is tormented by the fact that his own failure to keep his job was the cause of his wife's working in the express office and thus he is partly responsible for her death. Stride encounters a married couple heading west for California and helps them. Along the way they are joined by two n'er-do-wells Masters and Clete who know that Stride is after the express-office robbers. They plan to let Stride lead them to the bandits then make away with the loot themselves. But they aren't the only ones carrying a secret.::Jim Beaver <jumblejim@prodigy.net>

"September 11 2001. Two Al Qaeda terrorist pilots Asif and Nabi are seen in the cockpit of an airborne aircraft flying to an unknown destination. Nabi begins arguing with Asif about martyrdom and about according to Islamic tradition how many virgins one martyr will get upon entering Heaven. Nabi even goes as far as to phone his boss about the number and after they agree that the number isn't satisfactory they agree to divert their plane from their target to the Bahamas where there are hundreds of virgins on vacation there. Suddenly the cockpit door comes crashing down as the passengers stage a revolt against their captors (shades of Flight 93). But nevertheless the plane keeps on going and crashes into the first building of the World Trade Center killing everyone in the towers as well as an unfortunate window washer on a scaffolding.Six years later. In the small town of Paradise Arizona a volatile young man known only as the Postal Dude (Zack Ward) lives in a trailer park with his morbidly obese wife who's known only as the Dude's Bitch. After losing his job at a local post office the Postal Dude goes to another job interview at a local office where he is mocked by the cynical employment worker. The Dude gets a coffee at a local Starbucks where he is served by an attractive young barista named Faith (Jackie Tohn) who is the only person who seems friendly to the Postal Dude in this misanthropic town they live in. The Dude tells Faith that he's more than a little angry about his life and is desperate to get enough money to finally leave this dead-end town.After the Dude goes to a local unemployment office he is treated badly by the tellers who tell him to wait until another customer goes ""postal"" and begins shooting up the place with a handgun killing many customers. The Dude tries looking for the shortest ticket number on the dead victims in order to skip ahead in line but eventually gets thrown out by the ungrateful and mean workers.The Dude decides to team up with his Uncle Dave (Dave Foley) a slovenly con artist-turned-doomsday cult leader who owes the U.S. government over a million dollars in back-taxes. With the help of Uncle Dave's right hand man Richie (Chris Coppola) and an army of big-breasted scantily clad cult members the Dude devises a plan to hijack a shipment of 2000 Krotchy Dolls a rare sought-after plush toy resembling a giant scrotum. Uncle Dave plans to sell them online on eBay where their prices have reached as high as $4000 a doll.Unbeknownst to them Osama bin Laden (Larry Thomas) and his group of Al-Qaeda terrorists who had been secretly hiding in Paradise since September 11 under the watchful eye of bin Laden's best friend President George W. Bush (Brent Mendenhall) are after the same shipment but for entirely different reasons. Hoping to outdo the catastrophe of 9/11 they plan to instill the dolls with Avian influenza and distribute them to unsuspecting American children.The two groups meet at the shipment's destination a Nazi-themed amusement park called Little Germany. A fight between the Little Germany park creator (Vince Desiderio) and the theme park owner (Uwe Boll) (which ends with Boll being shot in the genitals confessing ""I hate video games"") sparks a massive shootout between the cult the terrorists and the police resulting in the death of dozens of innocent children. The Dude and the cult are able to get away with both the shipment and the park's opening day guest Verne Troyer pursued by Al-Qaeda the police and a mob of angry citizens. During the chase the Dude runs over the unemployment clerk who snubbed him earlier.Upon returning to their compound which has been overtaken by the terrorists the Dude Uncle Dave and the rest covertly sneak into the compound's underground bunker where Richie reveals that he must now fulfill the prophecy foretold in Uncle Dave's fictional Bible: to bring about the extinction of the human race. As per Uncle Dave's Bible the event initiating the apocalypse is the rape of a ""tiny entertainer"" by a thousand monkeys. After Verne Troyer is quickly thrown into a pit of chimpanzees Richie shoots and kills Uncle Dave then imprisons the Dude.The Dude manages to escape the compound with a plethora of weapons deciding to wage a one-man war against Al-Qaeda his uncle's murderer his cheating wife the police and the many people who want him dead. On the way to his trailer (where he plans to blow up his spouse) he meets up again with Faith who joins forces with him after an explosive gunfight at the trailer park. After calling a truce to the fighting The Dude makes a heartfelt but futile monologue about war the Dude and Faith proceed to kill all the terrorists as well as most of the bloodthirsty townspeople the remains of the now-mad cult his wife and her multiple lovers by blowing up his trailer. In the midst of the shootout Osama bin Laden despite being wounded escapes to a payphone where he calls George Bush in the White House for help. Bush sends a helicopter to save him and plans for the two to rendezvous.Having won their war the Dude his dog and the barista Faith drive away in a stolen police car. They casually turn on the radio only to learn that Bush has blamed the day's shootouts and explosions on China and India and has been ""forced to destroy both countries with nuclear force"". China in retaliation has unleashed 30 nuclear missiles towards America which are scheduled to hit in under two minutes. But the Dude no longer cares as he now has left Paradise and will enjoy his last minutes with his true soul mate Faith.The film's final shot features President Bush and Osama bin Laden skipping through a field together hand-in-hand. As mushroom clouds explode on the horizon Osama laughs and says ""Georgie I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship"". At that moment all of the nuclear missiles hit and the world is destroyed.

"Over the opening credits we see how the Hulk was born. Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) and Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) were scientists working on a project involving making the body resistant to certain types of radiation specifically gamma rays (the most harmful kind lead sheets required). However something went wrong and through Banners or the Hulks rather eyes we see him destroying the lab killing some other scientists injuring the project overseer General Thaddeus Thunderbolt Ross (William Hurt) and rendering Betty Rosss daughter of course unconscious. A little later we see Bruce at the bedside of Betty who is wavering in and out of consciousness when suddenly Ross is there with his arm in a sling screaming at Bruce. Bruce flees and the hunt begins as Ross tracks down every possible lead he can find on the location of Banner and what lies within him158 DAYS WITHOUT INCIDENTIn a town in Brazil Bruce wakes up from a nightmare of everything thats happened to him. He groans and goes about his morning routine which includes feeding his dog Rick and learning Portuguese by watching Sesame Street and comparing what he hears to a Portuguese-English dictionary. He also spends time learning relaxation techniques in an effort to control his heart-rate and keep himself from becoming too excited. He goes to his job as a day laborer at a local factory handing out dry goods and cleaning up messes while avoiding the old tough guys at a bottling factory. He also occasionally helps out with the electrical aspects when something breaks which it does today. As hes fixing it and joking around with the manager he cuts himself on a metal clip and the blood falls through all the grated floors onto the belt and Bruce freaks out yelling for the belt to stop. Confused the workers stop the belt and Bruce inspects the area where the blood fell cleaning it up and giving it the okay. As the belt starts and people start talking about the crazy gringo no one notices the drop of blood that fell into a bottle currently destined for the United States of America.Unaware of the contaminated bottle Bruce starts to leave but notices the same toughs who usually give him a hard time coming on to an attractive co-worker Martina. Bruce stops the action by asking Martina if shed like to have lunch with him tomorrow but the leader of the gang starts coming up to Bruce who cautions him in Portuguese by saying Dont make me hungry. you wouldnt like me when Im hungry. Confused Bruce goes over this just as the manager pops up enabling him to escape a beating and head for home stopping along the way to pick up a package from someone. Once there Bruce boots up his homemade computer and makes contact with someone named Mr. Blue in America. Together the two of them are working on a cure to Bruces little problem and after dicing up the package a flower and applying its juice to his blood Bruce regretfully types No change to which Blue types that he should come to New York and get more date contamination levels exposure rates types and amounts of radiation the works. He glances at a photo of Betty he keeps before regretfully saying that he cant do that either and powering down for the night.Meanwhile at the Pentagon Ross is receiving a report from his chief assistant Major Kathleen Sparr (Christina Cabot) that an old man in Ohio died after received gamma poisoning from his fruit drink that came from Brazil (note the man is Stan Lee Marvel creator). Ross quickly orders a team down there the next day put together with no small amount of efficiency by his old army friend General Joseph Greller (Peter Mensah). The team is headed up by the Russian-born but America-trained Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth). Ross informs them all that their target is a scientist who has stolen military secrets and that he will definitely be a fighter if cornered. As they fly down to Brazil Bruce gets a message from Blue saying that he may have success but needs Bruce's blood to be sure which Bruce reluctantly -- and carefully -- sends off to him. That night Bruce is sleeping soundly when Rick starts barking. Meanwhile the commandos have taken up position outside and are scanning the room with a camera which Rick promptly eats (or tries to). Disgusted the commandos blow off the door and after tranqing the dog fire a dozen tranquilizers at a sleeping Banner. They whip the covers off and see that it's just pillows. They hit the street after finding a rope getting a little ahead of Bruce who is hiding in the apartment of Martina just below him. After giving them a few minutes Bruce hits the ground but is immediately spotted by Blonsky. He breaks for it going across rooftops and up the sides of buildings at one point narrowly missing running right into a too-shocked-to-move Ross's arms. As he's running he manages to crash into some people that turn out to be the gang from the factory. They join in on the chase and Bruce ducks into the factory to lose them all but unfortunately the gang sees the chain swinging and the troops see the gang. The gang catches up with Bruce and start pummeling him ripping off his backpack and tossing it aside as he begs them to stop before his heart-rate gets too high getting out in Portuguese ""Me....angry....very bad..."" The leader laughs and moves in for the kill while the troops near the fight but suddenly Bruce's eyes flash green just as a dart hits one of the toughs. They blame Bruce and start in again but suddenly the leader is thrown a hundred feet through walls and the other men are screaming. The troops can't make out what's happening but Ross hears the audio feed and begins yelling at them to shoot go live do SOMETHING! They switch to live rounds as the last of the gangers is finished and the creature turns to leave smashing his way out with a big vat of something. The troops open fire but the bullets just bounce off of him like plastic. The creature roars and starts in on them as Blonsky tries to get in a higher position for a better view and shot. He finds it just as the last soldier is finished. He takes his shot and the creature notices him. A shadow passes and suddenly Blonsky is face-to-face with the Hulk. Hulk picks up another vat and slams it down and Blonsky goes flying as Hulk heads for the jungle pausing only to give a victory roar. Hours later Ross and Sparr are going through Banner's apartment and computer when Blonsky comes in demanding an explanation for what he saw out there. Ross just says that he did a good job and he should tell his men to pack up since they're leaving town1 DAY WITHOUT INCIDENTBruce wakes up beside a waterfall not quite sure where he is his pants hanging off of him and torn. He hears a truck and heads for the road where the driver tells him he's in Guatemala. The driver takes Bruce into town where Bruce proceeds to work his way north and pick up some new clothing while in Mexico. Meanwhile Blonsky has finally succeeded in wearing down Ross enough to tell him what went on. Ross explains that back in World War II there were a lot of special programs being worked on to give America the edge almost all of them under an Infantry Weapons Development program. One of them was a program for bio-tech force enhancment more commonly known as ""Super Soldier"". About five years ago Ross dusted off that program and began trying to put it together again. He recruited Banner and his team to work on it but then something went very wrong....or very right depending on how you look at it. In either case the end result according to Ross is that Bruce Banner's whole body is now in his opinion the exclusive property of the U.S. Government. The two men sit there and after an exchange about how they're both fighters Blonsky says that if he could put what he knows now in his body twenty years ago that would be someone he wouldn't want to fight. Ross smiles grimly and says ""I could probably arrange something like that."" Blonsky merely stares up at him intrigued.17 DAYS WITHOUT INCIDENT At Culver University in Virginia we see Bruce heading for the old science department where Hulk was born. However the appearance of security guards checking IDs puts the kibosh on those plans. Deterred he heads outside and sees the building housing all science teachers and who should come out but Betty chatting amiably with a friend of hers. He stares at her stupidly as she eats outside and she looks up towards him and smiles. He ducks behind a tree (yeah that'll work) but she was actually smiling at her newly arrived boyfriend Leonard Samson (Ty Burrel) psychologist extraordinaire. Now deterred and defeated he heads to an old on-campus pizza parlor where the owner Stanley (Paul Soles) is an old friend of his. Bruce asks about Samson (insert envy joke here) and then asks for two more things -- a place to stay for a few days and a job. The very next day we see him delivering pizzas in his old uniform and one of the stops happens to be the science lab. He talks to the guard (Lou Ferrigno Hulk from the TV series) and is able to get upstairs where after bribing the head computer genius with a pizza he gets on one of the computers to look for the data on his experiment but it's all gone. Bruce contacts Blue and tells him the bad news and then gets out of there.That night Bruce is getting ready to leave and Stanley is getting ready to close up when two final customers come in.....Betty and Samson. They begin chatting with Stanley as an unaware Bruce comes down the stairs. Just as Stan consents to make them a pizza Bruce opens the kitchen door and sees Betty who sees him. Her mouth opens in shock but when she looks again Bruce has taken off. She runs outside but doesn't see him hiding behind the dumpster and once back inside she bullies Stanley into spilling the truth. A while later we see Bruce walking in the rain on a highway when Betty pulls up behind him. He sees her and she runs to him begging him not to go. Soon they are pulling into the house she shares with Samson and she reveals a present she kept for him -- all the data from their experiment on a nice little portable drive. He tells her that he can't stay but accepts her offer of money and a ride to the bus station the next morning. Meanwhile Ross is pulling a serum out of cold storage and prepping Blonsky for injection which he warns will hurt. For his part Blonsky just grits his teeth and tells them to get on with it.The next day Bruce and Betty are walking through the college campus to the bus station when Betty pauses to fix Bruce's shirt making him more fashionable. As she does he sees a soldier move behind a column of one building and tells her to get as far away from him as she can. He bolts and as the soldiers move in she looks around for the command vehicle and convinces Ross to come out begging for him to stop. He ignores her request and orders the rest of the team in. Bruce ducks into a library and removes his pack. He fishes out the drive and forces it down his throat before moving on. However the pause has caused the soldiers to catch up to him and they trap him in an overpass as Blonsky moves in. They fire two canisters of knockout gas into the bridge but Banner transforms and leaps out. He begins fighting the soldiers leaping all around them and crushing their vehicles but Blonsky moves in and leaps around Hulk like a mosquito peppering him with rounds from a grenade launcher. He gets Hulk to follow him into the path of two sonic blasters which pepper Hulk with soundwaves but unfortunately Hulk sees Betty crying out and manages to take them apart using two parts of a nearby sculpture. Blonsky gets pissed and approaches Hulk and proceeds to get slammed into a tree breaking every bone in his body. Ross orders in a helicopter just as Betty runs towards Hulk. Hulk throws part of the statue at the chipper which crashes and makes a huge inferno that envelops Hulk who envelops Betty and keeps her safe from it though she does go unconscious again. Hulk looks at Betty and sees Ross standing there with Sparr. He snarls at Ross turns and heads off. Later we see Ross's boys taking everything Betty owned out of her house as Ross tells Samson that he did the right thing by calling Ross. In turn Samson calls Ross the bigger threat since Hulk protected Betty whereas Ross endangered her. Ross says that her safety is his utmost concern but Samson says that his best feature is that he always knows when someone is lying and that he also knows now why Betty never talked about him.That night in the North Carolina stretch of Great Smoky Mountains National Park Betty wakes up in a cave to the sound of a thunderstorm. She sees Hulk staring down at her curiously and screams. He jumps and hits his head on the ceiling of the cave but she calms him down. Suddenly lightning strikes and Hulk screams at it throwing a rock into the sky at this new challenger. Betty again calms him down reassuring him as a mother would her frightened child and eventually he goes to sleep. The next morning she and Bruce wake up and drive into town where Betty gets them a motel room and Bruce takes a shower and coughs up the data chip. Betty gets him some new clothes and together they get a used car with cash obtained from the pawning of her mother's old necklace. As she's paying though Bruce uses a public computer to send the data to Mr. Blue aka Samuel Sterns at his Empire State University email address. Even worse Ross's team with the help of the Strategic Homeland Infiltration Enforcement and Logistics Division (SHIELD) is able to capture this email and figure out where they're heading.....Empire State University. Meanwhile Ross is checking on Blonsky who had previously had more broken bits than the Titanic and is shocked when Sparr shows him a fully-healed Blonsky who is ""pissed off and ready for round three.""Back with Betty and Bruce we see them heading for New York when Betty asks what it's like when he changes. The best Bruce can answer is that everything is a lot more amplified. Betty points out that there's still something of him in there using the recognition of her as evidence so maybe if Bruce could control it -- but Bruce interrupts her saying that he wants to get rid of it. The next day the pair are in line at the Verrazano-Narrows bridge when Bruce notices a police checkpoint. They get out sneak around back of the truck and head down to the docks where after one boat ride they find themselves in the city and get a cab to ESU which turns out to be the most frightening ride ever and has Betty screaming obscenities at the lascividious cabbie. As he pulls away our pair have this exchange:Bruce: ""You know I could show you some techniques to manage that rage a little better...""
Betty: ""Don't start!""Eventually the pair get to ESU (with no cabbie murders) and meet the small quiet and unassuming young man known as Samuel Sterns (Tim Blake Nelson). Being thrilled to meet both of them he brings them up to his lab and they immediately start talking where he warns that if they miscalculate too high the dose could kill Bruce. In turn Bruce warns that if the dose is too low it could be dangerous to Sterns though Sterns just laughs this off clearly not believing him (though who could really?). Regardless they set about recreating the experiment with little trouble (student-used computers at fault). They manage to draw Hulk out and inject the antidote as Betty struggles to keep Hulk from lashing out. The antidote takes effect and Hulk reverts back to a hyperventilating Bruce. Meanwhile on a military base we see soldiers prepping for moving out while in a locker room Blonsky examines himself in a mirror. Unnoticed his spines elongates and extends out from his body the slightest bit. He boards the chopper and Ross asks him how he feels and he declares ""Like a monster.""In the lab Sterns is proposing his latest theory that what they injected Bruce with was just for the suppression of that one episode. He starts to talk about his subjects which causes Betty and Bruce to stare at him in horror and ask ""What subjects?"" He smiles gleefully and shows them a room with tons of distorted fetuses and dozens of synthesized bags of Bruce's blood all of which Sterns was able to make from that one sample Bruce sent. Bruce and Betty tell him that they need to destroy all of it but Sterns can only see a future Nobel Prize. Bruce starts to become agitated but a sniper suddenly tags him from outside just as Blonsky rushes in and knocks him out shoving Betty aside roughly. A team takes Bruce out as Sparr stays behind to supervise cleanup but as they do and as Betty storms onto a waiting chopper and away from the man she no longer wants to call her father Ross whispers to Bruce just before he gets loaded on ""If you took it from me I'll put you in a hole for the rest of your natural life.""Back on the ground Sparr is interrogating Sterns when she gets knocked out from behind by Blonsky. Sterns is terrified but then Blonsky says that he wants Sterns to turn him into what Bruce turns into. Sterns is eager to oblige for reasons that have nothing to do with Blonsky's threats but he does warn Blonsky that the result thanks to what Blonsky already has in him could be an abomination. Blonsky lifts Sterns to the ceiling and says that that counts as informed consent and the ball starts rolling. As Betty and Bruce share a moment in the chopper Sterns procedure takes hold and Blonsky -- now the Abomination -- smashes the whole lab spilling chemicals on Sterns whose head bubbles weirdly and begins to grow larger and flatter as he grins. Blonsky leaps outside and starts tearing up the streets and soldiers left there and one of the soldiers gets a message off to Ross that ""The Hulk is loose!"" Ross glances at Banner who appears just as shocked and says that's impossible. They manage to get a visual on-screen and they see the Abomination tearing apart the city. Bruce realizes that only one thing can stop that and Ross agrees. They move over the site and open the back door. Betty begs Bruce not to do it saying that they don't know if he'll change but he says he has to try. They kiss each other and then he allows himself to fall backward. He passes the level of buildings manages to say ""Oh shi--""SMASH!!!A huge hole appears in the middle of the pavement down the street from the Abomination. The Hulk slowly pulls himself from the hole and roars. Blonsky hears and grins and the two monsters run towards each other. They leap and collide in mid air with Blonsky carrying the way dazing Hulk slightly and punching him down the street. Hulk shakes it off and tears a police car in two and launches it at the Abomination. Blonsky takes the hit and then unleashes one of his own punching Hulk through a building and way downtown. The Abomination roars in delight and chases after him climbing up and over buildings to catch up as Ross orders the chopper gunner to open fire on Blonsky. Blonsky barely avoids all of the bullets and catches up to Hulk pummeling him some more before deciding to grab hold of the copter. Hulk sees this and then sees Betty in there roars and grabs hold of Blonsky creating a copter-Abomination-Hulk chain. The pilot says that it's too much weight and he has to put her down while Hulk and Abomination continue their battle on the landing struts. The battling becomes too much and the chopper finally crashes near a construction site (always the way...). As Betty and Ross pull themselves from the wreckage Blonsky keeps beating on Hulk. Suddenly a spark from the main rotor hits a gas puddle below the chopper. Hulk sees this happening becomes angrier and bigger and manages to shove the Abomination aside just in time to create a sonic boom that puts out the fire by creating a limited vacuum. Meanwhile the Abomination has found a huge chain that just happens to have two mace like attachments on the end and is swinging it at Hulk merrily. Hulk manages to get under it get a hold of the chain and wrap it around Blonsky's neck. He pulls it tight and Blonsky goes unconscious. He pulls it tighter determined to kill the source of his hurt and pain when Betty cries out ""Stop!"" Hulk sees her and calms and obeys. The Abomination is still out so Hulk tosses him to land at the feet of Ross before letting loose with another victory roar. He quiets and for a moment all is still. No one moves as the Hulk gazes distrustfully at all the little people with loud guns around him when suddenly a second chopper appears with a searchlight blaring. Hulk roars in frustration and takes to the roofs again running off. He reaches the coastline and...A few days later we see Betty on Liberty Island looking sad as she stares up at the big green woman. A beep sounds from her pocket and she pulls out a camera she had gotten while on the run with Bruce to see a picture of him not-quite-smiling back at her beneath the words ""low battery"". The camera suddenly powers down and Betty sighs saddened by the loss of the one proof she had of their time together...31 DAYS WITHOUT INCIDENTIn Bella Coola British Columbia we see a shack set up deep in the mountains. Inside we see Bruce addressing an envelope to Betty. When he's finished he opens the flap and puts her mother's necklace inside making sure to not be rough with it. That done he sits down and meditates thinking about what everyone told him about control. He closes his eyes breathes deeply and opens them again...They are glowing green.On a black screen we hear General Ross saying Reload. We find him sitting in an ordinary bar in an ordinary city uniform undone. The bartender refills his drink as the door opens. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) enters and sidles up to Ross offering his condolences on failing to capture Banner and losing control of Blonsky and saying that he did warn Ross against pursuing the Super Soldier program since it was shut down for a reason. Ross sighs and acknowledges Stark saying that he always wears the nicest suits to which Stark smiles and says Touch. Stark says that he heard that Ross had an interesting problem and Ross responds by saying Well youd know all about that wouldnt you? Not to be outdone Stark follows up with Were putting a little team together. Thought you might be interested. Finally letting his curiosity override his caution Ross says Whos we?"

In Queens New York a young woman (Donna Patti) is raped and murdered in her apartment building. Rubin (Vincent Russo) the attacker is seen by an elderly woman but she declines to inform the police. Instead she notifies a vigilante team comprised of local residents Nick (Fred Williamson) Ramon (Joseph Carberry) and Burke (Richard Bright). They find Rubin on a street corner bragging to friends about how he evaded prosecution for his crime and drag him to their van and drive away.The next day housewife Vickie Marino (Rutanya Alda) comes to the defense of a gas station attendant who is being bullied by Frederico 'Rico' Melendez (Willie Colon) leader of a the Headhunters street gang. When she returns home with her toddler son Scott she notices Rico and several gang members parked outside and calls police for help. Within seconds the gang enters and assaults her. Scott hides in the bathtub but gang member Prago (Don Blakely) kills him with a shotgun. Vickie runs to the backyard screaming for help and is brutally beaten by Rico.Meanwhile her factory wielder husband Eddie (Robert Foster) lunches at a saloon with co-workers Nick Ramon and Burke. Patrolman Gibbons (Steve W. James) enters and informs the group that Rubin was found dead in a vacant lot with every bone in his body broken. Nick takes no credit for the murder but reminds the officer that his neighbors need protection that police and the courts no longer provide.Later as Eddie leaves work he asks about the exchange with Patrolman Gibbons. Burke recalls his frustrating career as a police officer and recommends vigilantism as a more effective form of law enforcement. Eddie returns home to find his house surrounded by police cars. Detective Russo (Randy Jurgensen) assures Eddie that police know the identity of the guilty parties and advises him to file a complaint with District Attorney Mary Fletcher (Carol Lynley). Eddie meets with Fletcher who informs him that Rico has been arrested.Afterward Nick recounts a similar tragedy that befell his family and advises Eddie to carry a gun rather than allow himself to be victimized. Eddie disagrees believing an escalation of violence can only lead to anarchy. He attends Rico's arraignment as does Prago who pays defense attorney Eisenberg (Joe Spinell) a large amount of cash to assure Rico's freedom. Eisenberg motions to drop the murder charge against the child Scotty in return for a guilty plea for the assault on Vickie. Mary Fletcher agrees but demands a 15-year sentence. Judge Sinclair (Vincent Beck) notes that Rico has no prior convictions despite his 22 arrests and offers a two-year suspended sentence. Eddie is unable to contain his outrage and violently assaults Rico in open court. Judge Sinclair sentences Eddie to 30 days in prison for contempt of court.With Eddie in prison Nick and his group try to track down the source of drugs that have been sweeping their neighborhood. Nick chases after a small-time drug dealer named Blueboy (Frank Pesce) in a long foot-chase sequence whom they rough up and make him talk by hanging him by his ankles outside a building. Blueboy caves in and points them to his supplier: a local pimp named Horace (Bo Rucker).That evening Nick and the group follow and confront Horace the pimp after they watch him beating up one of his prostitutes for not making enough money for his daily cocaine habit. After a short chase through the streets they force Horace off the road where they torture him to reveal his drug source. Horace tells Nick that a high profile businessman named Mr. T is his suppler. After killing Horace Nick Ramon and Burke trace the illegal narcotics trade in their community to Thomas 'Mr. T' Stokes (Peter Savage) a prominent businessman with known connections to organized crime. They ambush and kill him outside his office the following night.Meanwhile at the prison Eddie is attacked in the shower by prison bully Leon (Kim Delgado) and his sycophant Felix (Burt Pittari) and nearly sodomized before an older inmate named Rake (Woody Strode) comes to Eddie's defense and subdues both of them.Upon Eddie's release he joins the vigilantes. They burst into Rico's apartment that same evening as he makes love to his girlfriend Rosie (Hyla Marrow) and accuse him of killing Scott. Rico insists that he did not kill Eddie's son and blames the murder on Prago but Eddie shoots Rico to death anyway. But then Rosie attempts to kill them and after wounding Burke gets shot dead by Nick. As the four vigilante's leave a member of the Headhunters witnesses the group's departure outside the building and informs Prago. As the police investigate the crime scene Detective Russo advises Patrolman Gibbons not to discuss the killings believing the media will portray the vigilantes as heroes.Prago takes over as leader of the Headhunters and mistakenly assumes that dirty cops killed Rico. The following night Prago and the gang ambush a police car and kill both cops including Patrolman Gibbons in a hail of bullets.The next day Vickie is released from the hospital but refuses to return home as the trauma left her with no feelings for her husband. Another day or two later Nick pays a visit to Eddie who then expresses his intent to leave the city in hope of finding a safer place to live. Nick tries to convince him to stay and fight for his home.A little later as Eddie is driving through Brooklyn on his way out of town in his van he spots Prago on the street and recognizes him from the courtroom that day of him being around Rico. Eddie parks his van and follows Prago on foot who soon spots Eddie and attempts to shoot him while Eddie returns fire. A climatic chase sequence begins where Prago hijacks a car and attempts to drive away while Eddie steals another car and chases after him through the streets evading other cars and pedestrians alike. A police car briefly gives chase but Eddie manages to knock the patrol car aside and off the road. The chase leads to a local dockyard mill on the East River where both cars crash and Eddie chases Prago on foot again up a storage tower where he confronts him with being the person who killed his young son. Sadistic and insane to the last Prago admits to killing Eddie's son and then dares Eddie to kill him... who responds by throwing Prago off the tower to his death without hesitating.In the final scene Eddie targets the last of his enemies: the corrupt Judge Sinclair who sentenced him to jail by planting a bomb under the judge's car in the Brooklyn courthouse parking lot. That night when Judge Sinclair gets in his car and starts the engine it explodes killing the judge. Watching from a distance in his van the satisfied Eddie drives away into the night.

"Eddie Marino is a factory worker in New York City. He has a wife named Vickie and a son named Scott. Eddie's friend and co-worker Nick and some of the factory's other workers have formed a vigilante group because Nick and the group are fed up with the pimps gangs and drug dealers who keep taking over the neighborhoods. Nick and his group are also sick and tired of the police because the police always fail to protect people who become victims. Eddie goes home from work one night only to discover that Vickie has been stabbed and Scott has been shot dead. Frederico ""Rico"" Melendez the leader of a Puerto Rican street gang is arrested for Vickie's stabbing and Scott's murder. Assistant District Attorney Mary Fletcher plans to put Rico away for as long as possible since New York doesn't have the death penalty. Nick tries to convince Eddie to join the vigilante group but Eddie turns Nick down preferring to let the courts handle Rico. Nick makes it clear that he has no faith whatsoever in the police and the judicial system. The case against Rico doesn't make it past the arraignment. Corrupt judge Sinclair sets Rico free with a two year suspended sentence. Eddie goes crazy and tries to strangle judge Sinclair who sentences Eddie to spend 30 days in jail for that. It was Rico's right hand man Prago who had fired the shot that killed Scott while Rico stabbed Vickie. Prago also paid judge Sinclair to set Rico free. In jail Eddie befriends an inmate named Rake. As soon as Eddie is released from jail he changes his mind about Nick's vigilante group. Eddie joins the group so he can go after Rico Prago and judge Sinclair.::Todd Baldridge"

"A montage of news footage illustrating a violent coup that is taking place in Nigeria overthrowing the Presidential family and establishing a dictatorship under the rebel general Yakubu. The Fulani rebels then begin a violent ethnic cleansing campaign against the Ibo (Eebow) tribes in the southern region. We then join a squad of SH-60B Seahawk helicopters on approach to the USS Harry S. Truman off the coast of Africa and a news reporter on the flight deck reporting on the coup taking place. His report is interrupted by the news of the whole presidential family being assassinated by rebel forces.Lieutenant Waters and his team of Navy SEALs disembark from a helicopter returning from a mission to extract American citizens from the embassy. They are greeted by Captain Bill Rhodes on the deck who immediately informs them that they'll need to be reinserted to extract a critical personality immediately. After refitting for the next mission eating and having their wounds tended by the medic they meet in the ships briefing room to get the details of their mission. They're instructed that they will Halo Jump over Cameroon and into the jungle outside of a small Catholic mission where they will find Dr. Lena Fiore Kendricks (an American citizen by marriage). Their secondary mission is to extract the priest and two nuns who run the mission if they are willing to go with them. Once they have their ""package"" they are to make a twelve kilometer hike to the designated extraction point where they'll be flown out by helicopter.The mission begins precisely as planned with the SEAL team dropping from the aircraft and free falling over the target area. After forcibly having a young Nigerian woman lead the SEALs to Kendricks Waters informs Kendricks of the rebel company approaching the mission and that their orders are to extract U.S. personnel. Kendricks refuses to leave the mission without the people under her care. Waters contacts Rhodes to explore their options and after a short and ambiguous conversation concedes to the doctor that they will take the refugees that can move under their own power with them. Kendricks agrees and immediately begins to round up every able-bodied refugee to make the hike. Irritated and behind schedule the SEALs start to move out with the refugees after daybreak. Their journey proves to be slow and hindered as guiding forty injured and wounded refugees is a difficult task.After night has fallen they decide to take a short break to allow the refugees to rest and give Dr. Kendricks time to administer medication to those that need it. Waters has his team setup a defensive perimeter around the refugees. Moments after the perimeter is set guerrilla rebels are rapidly approaching their position with Waters stealthily killing a straggling tailgunner. Dr. Kendricks expresses her concern to Waters that the rebels are headed for the mission but Waters is determined to carry out his orders and they continue on their way.They finally reach their landing zone and contact the helicopters that are en route. When the choppers land Waters' initial plan becomes clear as the SEALs suddenly turn on the refugees and hold them at gun point. Waters forces Dr. Kendricks onto the helicopter and the SEAL team collapses back for a swift extraction. The refugees are left stranded in the middle of the jungle without any protection against rebel forces.During the flight back to the Truman the helicopter crew and SEALS pass over the mission and discover that its been raided and destroyed just as Kendricks had predicted. Feeling a deep conviction Waters orders the helicopter to turn around and regroup with the refugees. The SEALs decide on the spot to escort the refugees to the Cameroon border.During the trip the SEALs discover that they are being tracked by a large body of rebel soldiers while using satellite scans of the area. Their pursuers are having mysterious success in their tracking of the SEALs. As they continuously attempt to escape and evade the rebels they encounter a small village that is in the process of being destroyed and the residents executed raped and murdered by rebel soldiers. Realizing that they have an opportunity to stop it Waters orders the refugees to remain on the high ground while his team assaults the village. They execute their plan with surgical precision eliminating the threat. During the aftermath of the assault the SEAL team becomes morally conscious after seeing the after-effects of the atrocities.While continuing on their way Slo determines that somebody within the group must be transmitting a signal that's allowing the rebels to identify their location and close in with incredible speed. It is then revealed that there is a surviving member of the Presidential family in their party Samuel Azuka's son Arthur and that its very important for the rebels to ensure his death. A newer ""refugee"" is discovered in the group to have a transmitter on his person. He attempts to flee but is shot dead. Waters is angry at Dr. Kendricks because she knew all along about Arthur's true identity yet never informed him.The SEALs unanimously continue to escort the refugees no matter what the cost is. A massive fire fight breaks out between the SEALs and the hundreds of rebels hidden in the trees. Soon the SEALs form a defensive line against the rebels as they order the refugees to retreat to the tree line where the Cameroon border is in sight. Zee radios in to the Truman for air support and two F/A-18 Hornets take off from the flight deck en route to their location.The SEALs continue to hold the line as they fall back to the refugees' location. However the overwhelming firepower of the rebels claims the lives of Slo Flea Lake and Silk. The refugees provide a small amount of cover fire as the remaining SEALs fall back into the reeds. During the battle Waters Red and Zee are all wounded. The planes forming the airstrike radio in to their location. The SEALs mark the ground with a smoke grenade and order the pilots to fire on everything between the tree line and the smoke. Arthur and Dr. Kendricks are scrambling to the gate when they hear the thunderous roar of there bed on approach. They are terrified to see the planes drop a substantial payload on the rebel fighters. With the battlefield engulfed in fire Arthur and Kendricks fear that the airstrike wiped out Waters' team.Waters Zee Doc and Red emerge from the grass as helicopters land on the other side of the Cameroon border as Captain Rhodes orders the guards to open the gate and let the SEALs and refugees in. A group of Marines then escort the SEALs to the helicopters where their wounds are tended to. Dr. Kendricks says her goodbyes to her friends and departs on the same helicopter with Waters.The final scene depicts the refugees recognizing Arthur as the tribal king and rightful heir to Nigeria and he raises his hand exclaiming ""Freedom!"" as his fellow Nigerians celebrate around him. In the closing title we see the quote ""The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing"" by Edmund Burke."

When the democratic government of Nigeria collapses and the country is taken over by a ruthless military dictator Waters a fiercely loyal and hardened veteran is dispatched on a routine mission to retrieve a Doctors Without Borders physician Dr. Lena Kendricks.

When Waters arrives however Dr. Kendricks refuses to leave unless he promises to help deliver the villagers to political asylum at the nearby border. If they are left behind they will be at the mercy of the enormous rebel army. Waters is under strict orders from his commanding officer Captain Bill Rhodes to remain disengaged from the conflict. But as he and his men witness the brutality of the rebels first-hand they are won over to Dr. Kendricks' cause and place their lives at risk by agreeing to escort the villagers on a perilous trek through the dense jungle. As they move through the countryside on foot Waters' team experts at evasion and concealment are inexplicably and ferociously pursued by an army of rebels. They are confounded until they discover that among the refugees is the sole survivor of the country's previous ruling family whom the rebels have been ordered to eliminate at all costs.

During their fight Lori and Will burn the gas tanks at the docks to blow both Freddy and Jason up. Until then Jason already lost four fingers and his eyes. When the fire starts to spread Jason rips off Freddy's arm with the claws and Freddy stabs Jason's heart with the machete. The resulting explosion sends both of them into the lake. Freddy comes back and attempts to kill Lori with Jason's machete. Jason ultimately defeats Freddy despite appearing to die in the process stabbing him with Freddy's own claws before falling into Crystal Lake though if he did this to continue battling Freddy or for some reason save Lori for saving him earlier is unknown. Lori picks up Jason's machete while Freddy kneels on the dock helplessly. She shouts at Freddy ""Welcome to my world bitch!"" then uses the machete to behead Freddy and throws the machete to Jason as he sinks. Lori and Will depart but the next morning Jason rises from the water carrying his machete and Freddy's severed head which smirks and winks at the audience before laughing maniacally leaving the winner ambiguous."

Two of the most remembered eighties slasher film icons finally clash together on the big screen in a film fans have long been awaiting. Trapped in Hell when the authorities of Springwood manage to erase all evidence of his existence (and thus the fear that gives him his power) nightmare spirit Freddy Krueger comes across the soul of the equally infamous Camp Crystal Lake mad slasher Jason Voorhees. Taking the guise of Jason's mother Freddy resurrects him and commands him to start terrorizing Springwood hoping to instill enough fear that the name Freddy Krueger gets out again so that the ensuing panic makes Freddy strong enough to return a seventh time. The plan works but Freddy soon discovers that Jason true to his nature in the past will not stop killing and is taking each of his victims.

"Set around five years after 'First Blood' John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) is working in a labor camp prison somewhere in the USA when he gets a visit from his former commander Colonel Sam Trautman (Richard Crenna). Trautman offers Rambo the chance to be released from prison after being convicted by a military court after the events of the first film and given full clemency but on condition of taking a mission where he will infiltrate Vietnam to search for American POWs that are still rumored to be held by the Vietnamese.Rambo travels with Trautman to Thailand and meets Marshal Murdock (Charles Napier) an American bureaucrat who is in charge of the operation and his right-hand men who are freelance military contractors Ericson (Martin Kove) and Lifer (Steve Williams). Murdock tells Rambo that the American public is demanding knowledge about the POWs and they want a trained commando to go in and search for them. Rambo is briefed that he is only to photograph the POWs and not to rescue them nor is he to engage any enemy soldiers due to the unstable situation between the USA and Vietnam. Rambo reluctantly agrees and he is then told that a CIA informant named Co will be there to receive him in the jungles of Vietnam. Before he leaves on his mission Rambo tells Trautman that Murdock is lying about his combat experience. Rambo tells Trautman he's the only person he can trust.Rambo parachutes into the Vietnamese jungle but loses most of his equipment in the process due to the faulty jump and is left only with his knives his bow and arrows. Miles from his landing spot Rambo is met by a woman named Co-Bao (Julia Nickson) who introduces herself as his contact (Murdock had incorrectly identified the contact as a man). Co arranges for her and Rambo to go upstream with a group of local river pirates. During the boat ride Co reveals that she would like to eventually travel to America while Rambo confides to her that he was chosen for this mission because he is expendable.Rambo is led to a nearby camp commanded by Captain Vinh (William Ghent). After dispatching a sentry with a throwing knife Rambo finds an American Banks (Andy Wood) hanging from a makeshift crucifixion and frees him. Banks warns that several other American POWs are being held there. A patrol discovers the dead sentry and Vinh's second-in-command Lieutenant Tay (George Cheung) heads out into the jungles in search of the intruder. Rambo Co and Banks escape with the pirates but are attacked by a Vietnamese gunboat and are promptly betrayed by the pirates who fear the military's reprisals should they not cooperate; Rambo sends Co and Banks to safety and manages to destroy the gunboat with an RPG and kill all the pirates.Rambo radios and calls for extraction. Trautman Ericson and Lifer head out in a rescue chopper. However once it becomes apparent that Rambo has a live POW with him Murdock radios the chopper ordering them to scrub the extraction and return to base. When Trautman protests Lifer pulls a gun on him. Ericson tells him they have their orders (implying that he doesn't like it either) but Trautman denounces them both as ""goddamn mercenaries."" Rambo and Banks watch helplessly as the helicopter flies off and are forced to surrender as Tay's squad advances. Co having escaped watches from the jungle nearby.Back at the base in Thailand Trautman angrily confronts Murdock accusing the whole mission of being a sham Rambo wasn't supposed to find anything there. He suspects that the whole situation is really about money; the US government refused to pay war reparations to Vietnam and the Vietnamese apparently kept American POWs for revenge. Murdock tells Trautman that the political situation is far more delicate than he realizes and he needs to swallow his pride and let this go. Trautman refuses while also insisting that Murdock should be more worried about Rambo.Rambo's wrists are bound to an oxen yoke and he is lowered naked into a chest-deep leech-infested cesspool (or possibly a pit dug especially for the purpose of torture). The torture is briefly interrupted by the arrival of Vinh's Soviet Liason officer Lt. Col. Podovsky (Steven Berkoff) and his silent robust henchman Sergeant Yushin (Voyo Goric). Although Podovsky orders Vinh to take Rambo out of the cesspool and clean him up the POWs believes things are about to get worse for him. Podovsky orders Rambo to contact the American military and tell them that they should not send any more commandos for rescue operations in Vietnam. When Rambo refuses Yushin tortures him. This yields no results so they bring in Banks and threaten to kill him. Rambo grudgingly agrees to Podovsky's condition.Meanwhile Co enters the camp in the guise of a prostitute and comes to the hut in which Rambo is held captive. Rambo uses the radio to contact the US base in Thailand but instead of relaying Podovsky's message he uses this opportunity to swear vengeance on Murdock. He uses the mic's base to hit Yushin while Co dispatches another guard with her shotgun. The two then fight their way out of the camp. Once they are a safe distance away Co tends to Rambo's wounds and begins to implore him to take her to the United States. Rambo agrees and they kiss however they are then attacked by some Vietnamese soldiers and Co is killed by Tay whom escapes. Rambo kills the remaining Vietnamese soldiers and then buries Co's body in the jungle.Following his escape the camp's Soviet and Vietnamese soldiers are sent to look for him. Rambo assembles his weapons and using guerrilla warfare tactics is able to kill a large number of enemy troops including Vinh. He proceeds to a nearby enemy camp and destroys it by pouring gasoline in a nearby reed field and setting it afire and takes out several vehicles with explosive arrows. He comes face-to-face with Tay and kills him with an explosive arrowhead. Yushin appears in a UH-1N Twin Huey and drops a firebomb on Rambo's position. Rambo escapes and hijacks the Huey helicopter after killing Yushin and proceeds towards the POW camp. He destroys most of the camp with the helicopter then lands and arms himself with the M-60 machine gun that is mounted on the Huey kills the remaining Vietnamese soldiers and rescues all the POWs. They get to the helicopter and head towards the American camp in Thailand.Podovsky chases them in his Mi-24 helicopter gunship. Although Rambo's helicopter is heavily damaged by Podovsky's helicopter he manages to land his helicopter on a river then plays dead. When Podovsky carelessly approaches the downed Huey Rambo fires a LAW 66mm rocket at Podovsky's chopper obliterating it.Rambo then returns to the base and grabs a mounted M60. He kicks Ericson in the crotch and enters Murdock's command center shooting all of Murdock's hi-tech equipment to shreds. He threatens Murdock with a knife challenging him to find and rescue the remaining American POWs in Vietnam. As Trautman prepares to leave the camp Rambo says that he will be staying in Asia in a bid to find himself. Trautman agrees that their government gave them a raw deal but he asks that Rambo not hate his country for it. Rambo insists that he doesn't he only wants his country to love its soldiers as much as its soldiers love it. As he leaves Trautman asks him ""How will you live John?"" To which Rambo replies ""Day by day."" The film credits roll as Rambo walks off into the distance while his mentor watches him."

"Millennia ago in the Antarctica the Ancients depart.In the modern day Stargate Command has a base established in an Ancient outpost and are working to understand the technology and determine who has the gene necessary to control it. Daniel Jackson informs Dr Elizabeth Weir (the leader of the expedition) and Dr. Rodney McKay (the head scientist) that the symbols which could take them to Atlantis which is somewhere in the Pegasus Galaxy uses an eight-symbol Stargate address. Dr. Beckett (the expeditions head Surgeon) while reluctantly attempting to control the Ancient chair sets off a 'drone' (an Ancient projectile weapon) that almost brings down Brigadier General O'Neill and pilot Major John Sheppard as they approach the base by helicopter.O'Neill arrive and commends Sheppard on his exceptional flying and then Daniel briefs him on the discovery of the gate address and that they need the Z.P.M. to power the gate. Sheppard explores the base and stumbles upon Dr. Beckett at the control chair. Beckett explains to Sheppard who has just been given security clearance the chair device and how it have a certain gene to operate it. Sheppard proceeds to sit in the chair and activating it conforming the he has the gene. Dr. Weir offers him a spot on the expedition but he is a bit hesitant to go which may very well be a one-way trip. O'Neill encourages him and eventually Sheppard agrees and joins in as everyone prepares for the expedition.At Stargate Command the expedition prepares to leave and Sheppard meets Colonel Marshall Sumner (the military commander) and who is not too fond of Sheppard. Dr. Rodney McKay rigs the ZPM into the Stargate to provide the power necessary for an eight-symbol connection and they send a MALP through to ascertain conditions. The telemetry shows viable life support and they go through. Sumner and his men secure the gate area on the other side and begin exploring. They find a highly-advanced control room where all the systems activate when Sheppard approaches. Two scientist find a room full of small spacships and report to Weir. Sumner finds a window and discovers that they are in an underwater city and the ocean is being held back by a force field. Beckett finds a hologram of an Ancient woman who warns of a terrible enemy and explains that the city was sunk in a desperate attempt to save it. Fearing the siege would never end she says the Ancients used the Stargate to return to Earth. At this point the scientists realize that power levels are dropping and it is determined the three main power cells (Z.P.M.s) are weakening.Weir sends Sumner through the Ancients' Stargate (complete with iris-like force field) to start looking for a power source or a safe haven in the Pegasus Galaxy. Sumner takes Sheppard Lt. Ford and a team through to a planet where they find humans living and they make friendly contact. They meet Teyla Emmagan the leader of the Athosians who warns them of the ""Wraith"".The next day Sumner and his men spot the ruins of what looks to have been a high-tech city. The Athosians advise them not to enter it as local folklore warns it will bring the Wraith. While Sumner takes men into the city anyway Teyla leads Sheppard to some local ruins that contain simple murals depicting the Wraith returning every few centuries to 'cull' the humans. While there Sheppard finds a necklace that Teyla lost long ago and returns it to her.As darkness again falls the Stargate activates and three small spaceships come through. Sumner and his men prepare for the attack as the enemy closes in on the village.The Wraith ships arrive at the Athosian village and begin teleporting up the locals the SG weapons prove useless and mysterious ghost-like figures seem to attack them but Teyla warns they are illusions projected by the Wraith. They manage to bring one ship down before Sumner and Teyla are both grabbed. The two remaining Wraith ships activate the Gate by remote control and depart but not before Lt. Ford memorizes the dial code.Back at the Atlantis base the power continues to wane and catastrophic failure is imminent. Weir is preparing to order an evacuation when the remainder of the team returns with the surviving natives. Before they can depart the city automatically rises above the water giving them time to find Sumner and the others and locate a power source.Weir is reluctant to send someone to find Sumner without a remote chance of success over Sheppard's objections. Meanwhile Teyla Sumner and the others are confronted by the Wraith who take away one of the villagers. They track the coordinates and find a Stargate floating in orbit around a planet. McKay and Sheppard prepare one of the Atlantis spaceships dubbed Puddle Jumpers by Sheppard equipped with cloaking technology and Sheppard and Ford fly the ship through the Stargate to the coordinates and start searching for the Wraith.The Wraith return and take Sumner while Ford and Sheppard find their base and land nearby preparing an assault. Sumner is taken into a great hall and brought before a skeleton where he is confronted by a female Wraith the Keeper. Sheppard and Ford find the other prisoners and Sheppard goes to find Sumner who is being telepathically scanned by the Keeper. He tries to resist giving her information about Earth that she wants so they can find new feeding grounds. She drains his life force aging him but he refuses to give her further information. Sheppard shoots the Keeper through the hand breaking the connection and killing Sumner to spare him the agony. Sheppard is knocked out and taken prisoner.Teyla asks Ford to go after Sheppard which proves fortunate when he arrives in time to free Sheppard before the Keeper can interrogate and kill him as she did Sumner. Sheppard kills the Wraith with a Wraith weapon but in the process awakens the base-hive and the thousands of sleeping Wraiths. Evading the teleport-capture beams they get to the ship and head for the orbital Stargate. Using the Jumper's telepathic connection Sheppard manages to draw off the Wraith ships and then get back to the Gate sending his ID code ahead. They go rocketing into the Atlantis base (but are stopped by a the autopilot) and reactivate the iris force field just in time to destroy the pursuing ships. The team celebrate as the Athosians make themselves at home in the base while Sheppard takes command as the ranking military officer. Teyla offers her people's knowledge of their Stargate addresses as a token of friendship and gratitude."

For years mankind has been visiting other worlds by using an ancient device called a stargate found in Egypt. Research has shown the stargates have been built by an advanced race called the Ancients. Now another stargate has been found on Earth in an Ancient base on Antarctica. Scientists think this may have been the lost city of Atlantis and it is found out certain people have an Ancient gene that activates the technology. Dr. Rodney McKay has a different idea. He finds out this particular stargate is able to dial to another galaxy the Pegasus galaxy where Atlantis really might be. A team of scientists and military officers decide to explore this location. There's only one problem powering the device requires a Zero Point Module currently used for the defense of Earth. There's only one available and returning might not be possible.::Arnoud Tiele (imdb@tiele.nl)
Having discovered the gate address to Atlantis in Antarctica Dr. Elizabeth Weir assembles an international team of scientists and with the support of the US military sets off to the distant Pegasus galaxy knowing that they may not be able to return given the power requirements to travel such a great distance. Once there they find what they had hoped for: the lost city of Atlantis self-contained and submerged in water but protected by a force field. As they explore the huge underwater city they find it nearly intact but their very presence depletes the power supply to the point where they will have to evacuate if they do not find an alternate source of energy. Led by Col. Marshall Sumner and Maj. John Sheppard a team uses the gate to travel to a nearby world in search of power. There they encounter the Athosians an intelligent people who live in primitive surroundings. They abandoned their cities long ago and live in the woods after frequent attacks from the Wraiths a war-like race that feeds on its victims. While some of the team manage to return to Atlantis Col. Sumner and the Athosian leader Teyla Emmagan are taken prisoner forcing Maj. Sheppard and Lt. Aiden Ford to lead a rescue mission.::garykmcd
"In Washington DC a Senate hearing is being held. The hearing is chaired by a powerful Senator Lillian DeHaven who questions the US military's policies of women being allowed to serve in combat situations. DeHaven plans to have a female naval officer enroll in SEAL training one of the toughest training programs the US Military has to offer with a 60% failure rate amongst its candidates. She receives much resistance from the Naval representatives at the hearing however she uses her influence to put her plan into action.The candidate DeHaven handpicks is Lieutenant Jordan O'Neill who works in Naval communications as a satellite communications specialist. O'Neill has been passed over for promotion within her division with many male coworkers having less experience than she does. O'Neill is also romantically involved with one of her superior officers Royce. Tension arises between herself and Royce when she chooses to participate in the training course.O'Neill reports to the SEAL training facility and is immediately subject to ridicule and discrimination from her fellow candidates and the base's commanding colonel who makes attempts to treat her delicately because she's a woman. The facility's command master chief (CMC) John Urgayle addresses his candidates for the 1st time by reciting a poem ""Self Pity"" by DH Lawrence. The trainees are then begin their ""hell week"" where they are subjected to extremely rigorous mental and physical conditions: they are forced to push heavy ship fenders up sand dunes exercise in cold water hold heavy rafts over their heads for prolonged periods of time and are constantly ridiculed by Urgayle's staff. When the training regimen becomes too much for a candidate they have the option of leaving the program voluntarily by ringing a ceremonial bell three times.Hell week ends for the candidates when they are required to run a difficult obstacle course under live fire. O'Neill is told that there will be a small set of wooden steps at a wall marking the end of the course to make it easier for her to scale the wall -- she protests and is told to be quiet. The trainees including O'Neill make it to the wall; O'Neill pushes the step unit aside and volunteers her own body to allow her fellow trainees to get over the wall. The last trainee Cortez reaches his hand down to help O'Neill but keeps his grip just out of reach and then suggests she quit. (He is later punished for his actions.) O'Neill uses the stair unit to scale the wall and runs to join her comrades but misses a tripwire signifying she may have killed some or all of the company. Later when Urgayle's staff reads of the candidates' times O'Neill finds to her surprise she passed the course even though she came in dead last behind other candidates who didn't finish in the required 12 minute limit. She's told that she was given a 30 second buffer a concept they refer to as ""gender norming"". O'Neill meets directly with the base's colonel who never happy about the idea of a woman being allowed into SEAL training tells her that he'd altered the program because she's a woman. O'Neill requests that she be treated the same as the male candidates including being allowed to take up residence in their barracks. Her request is granted and she reports to the base's barber shop. The barber isn't there and she shaves off her long hair herself and joins the men in their barracks. After a brief argument with one of the other candidates Urgayle orders the ranking officer Wickwire to make up a schedule to allow O'Neill privacy in the head and shower.Back in Washington O'Neill's success in hell week is reported to DeHaven. It is revealed that DeHaven has also been generating publicity about O'Neill's candidacy but she has an ulterior motive: she is using the incident as leverage to prevent the closing of military bases in her native Texas but voting for base closings in other states.O'Neill continues through the rest of the program learning how to use weapons field strip and reassemble them and learns the effects of forced drowning from interrogation. She manages to score higher than most of her male counterparts and slowly begins earning the respect of more of her comrades. During an exercise where they are extracted from the water by high-speed boats O'Neill fails to pull herself from the water (though she receives little help unlike her male teammates). Urgayle lectures her later about her failure in the test and tells her he earned the Navy Cross for pulling a man much larger than himself from a burning tank. He worries that O'Neill may not be able to perform a similar task under combat conditions. He also tells her that she'll be taking over a squad when one of the other trainees must leave due to an injury. The trainees then enter a very crucial stage of the program called SERE. They will be placed into a simulated combat mission where they are very likely be captured and subjected to harsh interrogation and physical abuse. The teams are dropped off at the coast of Captiva Island and under O'Neill's direction make their way inland until they find what appears to be a deserted compound. While they perform their reconnaissance procedures part of O'Neill's team Cortez and Slovnick break off and try to retrieve a helmet for a souvenir contravening her direct orders. The helmet is shot off its perch by a sniper and a net traps them both. O'Neill and the rest of her team try to retreat into the forest and are quickly captured.Their captors turn out to be Urgayle his assistant Pyro and the rest of their training instructors. The ranking officers including O'Neill are thrown into confined wooden boxes and taken one at a time into the main shack to be interrogated. When O'Neill is taken in Urgayle preys upon his perceived notion of O'Neill's weakness & her ability to carry out one of her team who was injured in their attempted escape. Urgayle then begins to beat O'Neill viciously under the pretense of the treatment she'd receive if she were really captured by an actual hostile. Urgayle drags O'Neill outside and shoves her head in a trough of muddy water demanding that the other prisoners reveal intelligence about the rest of the SEAL team in the forest. Urgayle then threatens to rape O'Neill in front of the company. O'Neill her hands bound behind her kicks Urgayle in the crotch and slams her skull into his face breaking his nose. She then kicks him further. Urgayle gets to his feet and beats O'Neill down. He staggers to the prisoner corral and tries to convince the male members of the team who have all turned their backs on him that O'Neill is a weak link that could get them all killed. O'Neill having regained her feet suddenly shouts ""SUCK MY DICK!!"" to Urgayle. The rest of the team rallies behind her and Urgayle gives up defeated.After returning from SERE training the team with new found respect and admiration for O'Neill's tough nature and courage treat her to a drink. Shortly after O'Neill is called into the colonel's office and presented with pictures of her hanging out with female officers suspected of being lesbians. O'Neill is told she'll be sent back to Washington and will take up a desk job until the matter is investigated. If O'Neill wishes to complete the SEAL program she'll have to start over again. Furious at the false charges O'Neill rings out of the SEAL program and drives back to Washington. She goes to the home she'd been sharing with Royce. Royce shows her evidence from DeHaven's office showing that the Senator had sent a memo to the Navy about the dangers of letting a woman complete SEAL training and that US citizens aren't ready for women to enter combat. O'Neill goes to a Senate committee hearing concerning the closing of military bases and confronts DeHaven openly. Accusing DeHaven of deliberately sinking her career for her own gain DeHaven says she's actually amazed that O'Neill had gotten as far as she did in the training program and that her approval of O'Neill's enlistment was a publicity stunt. O'Neill threatens to take DeHaven's actions regarding military base closings to the news units just outside the hearing room and DeHaven promises to get O'Neill back into the SEAL program and does. O'Neill returns to her unit.The last phase of training is to be conducted somewhere in the Mediterranean Sea. While awaiting orders aboard a submarine an emergency mission comes up and Urgayle's team is ordered to participate. A US satellite had come down in Libya and the US Army Ranger team sent in to retrieve it needs assistance in reaching their pickup point. The plutonium in the satellite is weapons grade according to O'Neill and could easily fall into enemy possession. After landing on the beach O'Neill & Urgayle split from the rest of the team and reconnoiter a nearby Libyan camp. When a Libyan border patrol party shows up unexpectedly O'Neill hides while being covered by Urgayle. They quickly determine that the Ranger team could be discovered. When one of the party gets too close to O'Neill's hiding spot Urgayle shoots him drawing the attention of the man's comrades. O'Neill and Urgayle retreat O'Neill making it safely back to the beach. Surmising that the Chief wouldn't draw the Libyans back to the rallying point for both the satellite recovery unit and the SEAL team she identifies another location that the Chief would more likely retreat to. The team sets up an ambush there with a minefield and the Chief shows up. During a furious firefight Urgayle is hit in the leg and O'Neill rushes into the minefield and drags the Chief out. The mines are detonated and the team escapes. On the beach they receive assistance from a helicopter unit & are all loaded onto one of the choppers and lifted out.Back at the SEAL training facility the successful graduates receive their pins for completing the training from Urgayle. O'Neill goes to empty her locker and finds a copy of DH Lawrence's poetry with a Navy Cross marking the page with the poem ""Self Pity"". She sees Urgayle who gives her a glance and then walks out of the locker room. The closing credits are preceded by Urgayle's speech to the candidates before they begin hell week."

"Houngan a voodoo-esque priest recites a chant while surrounded by candles. As he stabs a decapitated human head Matt Cordell the so-called 'Maniac Cop' is lying dead in his coffin when he opens his eyes and punches though the casket.The next day Detective Sean McKinney talks to Officer Kate Sullivan on a shooting range. She complains about being in trouble with her stiff superiors for using excessive force (she has been dubbed ""Maniac Kate"") Since it is her birthday McKinney gives Kate a wristwatch and she thanks him since he is one of the few cops whom is casually nice to her.McKinney goes to a crime scene where a headless corpse is found with a dead chicken stuffed inside. The detective talks about Palamayumbe a ritual which uses heads; the chicken is left inside the body to let the soul ""take flight"".That evening Kate and her partner are at a scene where a crazy man named Frank is inside a store shooting anyone who enters. Reporters Bishop and Tribble are nearby and listening to the police scanner for stories and they are exited to hear that the notoriously aggressive Kate Sullivan is at the scene. After Kate's partner is killed by Frank she runs inside with an automatic rifle and shoots at Frank until he runs into the pharmacy (with bullet-proof glass) for refuge.At the same time McKinney describes to Houngan (standing by a barrel of fire) a symbol resting next to the corpse and Houngan says that it is the symbol of ""anti-justice"".Back at the pharmacy Kate runs to the roof loads hollow-point bullets into her revolver and jumps through the roof and into the pharmacy. Frank holds the girl from the pharmacy as a shield and Kate shoots him without hesitating. The girl says: ""You shot Frankie!"" Kate realizes that she had buzzed Frank into the pharmacy and they are both involved with the shooting spree. They both open fire and the girl is hit in the head and Kate is also hit as the two reporters are filming everything.Meanwhile Cordell goes to see Houngan and the man tells the undead cop that he allowed himself to bring him back to life because his spirit is not at rest. Cordell hears the news of Kate on the radio (the video of the incident at the pharmacy has been edited by the dirty reporters to make it believe that Kate killed the pharmacist's assistant in cold blood and that the woman was innocent). Cordell is angry and leaves.At the hospital McKinney asks Dr. Myerson about Kate and he tells the detective that Kate is brain head due to being in a coma from the shooting. Outside the hospital a man says uncomplimentary things about Kate when Cordell arrives and throws him and shoots the man in the air.The next day McKinney talks to his friend Willie and learns that the pharmacist Frank is using the police due to Kate using illegal weapons. Frank has been giving a six-month suspended sentence in exchange for dropping the lawsuit. McKinney goes to the hospital and asks Dr. Susan Fowler if he can talk to Frank. The detective tries to help Frank remember more about the shooting at the pharmacy by cutting off some of his oxygen.A comatose Kate dreams of walking down a church aisle to meet an ugly and decomposing Cordell at the altar. She opens her eyes and grabs a nearby McKinney when she sees Cordell behind him. The detective tells Susan about her movement and her heart monitor speeding up but the doctor sees no change in Kate's physical being. Regardless Susan tells Myerson what has happened and asks for another brain scan but Myerson think that it would be a waste of time and money.Later Myerson is enjoying some time with a woman in the doctor's lounge and Cordell knocks on the door. When the doctor comes out Cordell shocks him with defibrillator pads. He chases Myerson to the roof where he places the pads on the doctor's face killing him. Afterwards Susan sees Cordell lurking around the hallways and follows him to the basement but he disappears. Later after the police discover the body of Myerson Susan tells McKinney about seeing a cop leave Kate's room. McKinney goes to the basement and finds the old church altar with Houngang who talks to the detective about resurrection. He says that McKinney and Cordell walk the ""same path"".Hank Cooney a local police official goes to the hospital to see Dr. Powell and tells him that by cutting off Kate's life support would save the city some trouble. Cooney shows that he has a letter of consent signed by Kate's mother. Powell says that he can take care of it later that afternoon. A little later Powell hears glass break in the X-ray room where Cordell grabs him and straps him underneath the X-ray machine for a fatal treatment with repeated blasts with high-powered X-rays. Cordell takes the letter of consent and crumples it.That evening the dirty reporters Bishop and Tribble go to the scene of a drive by shooting (which sounds intriguing since it was reportedly a child shot). At the scene Bishop callously interviews the brother of the young victim. He then looks for Tribble finding him dead inside an ambulance with two dead attendants. Bishop is stabbed through the back by Cordell.The next day McKinney watches the unedited version of the pharmacy shooting and sees that the girl killed by Kate had buzzed Frank in.Back at the hospital Cordell places a gun by Frank's pillow uncuffs him and leaves him the keys. As Cooney and Gina Lindey Frank's lawyer discuss clearing Frank's long criminal records (so he can get the benefits of film or literary rights) Frank and his two hospitalized criminal roommates escape and shoot and kill Cooney Lindsey and the guard on the floor. Cordell then goes back to Kate's room where he picks her up and carries her away. McKinney arrives back at the hospital and seeing the dead bodies hides under a hospital gurney and shoots and kills Frank's two criminal associates. He follows Frank to the women's restroom where he kicks a stall door and is grazed by a bullet from Frank (hiding behind a woman on the toilet) and finally kills the trigger happy criminal.Susan bandages McKinney's arm and they kiss. The detective is told that Kate has been taken away. McKinney and Susan run to the basement church were Houngan is standing over Kate's comatose body and Cordell is standing behind him with a shotgun. Houngan says that Cordell has ordered him to resurrect Kate but McKinney tells Cordell that Kate is now at peace since all the people responsible for her condition are dead and to ""let her go"". Cordell tells Houngan to ""finish it"". Houngan says that he cannot ""recover"" Kate because Kate will not allow him and Cordell shoots Houngan knocking over some candles which set fire to Kate's body. Cordell picks up Kate's flaming body and they burn together as McKinney and Susan run outside and avoid an explosion.McKinney and Susan get into an ambulance to get away as the whole building begins to burn. But as they are driving down a road a flaming Cordell follows them in another car. The ambulance driver jumps out and McKinney gets behind the wheel as the burning Cordell tries to reach his hand inside and literally pushes cars out of the way. McKinney tosses an oxygen take in the backseat of Cordell's car but the maniac cop latches his arm onto the passenger's side door. The detective drives by a road sign slicing Cordell's arm off and the ambulance flips over. Cordell stops the car turns around and slams it into drive but the car explodes when the oxygen tank explodes. McKinney lights a cigarette with Cordell's flaming severed arm.In the final scene the burned-to-a-crisp bodies of Cordell and Kate lie side by side on tables in the morgue and Cordell lovingly touches Kate's still body.

Back on deck they both hook to the rescue cable. Halfway up the winch jams and the cable begins to unravel. Ben realizing it can't hold both of them unhooks and tries to fall. Jake catches and will not let him go holding onto him by his glove simply saying ""I won't let go."" Ben understandingly says ""I know."" and unstraps his glove plummeting from a fatal height into the ocean. Desperate to go in Jake isn't allowed as the only cable they have is broken and are afraid to lose Jake as well; the spotlights never see Ben resurface.Then Jake Fischer begins to narrate. ""The Coast Guard conducted one of the largest search-and-rescue missions for a single man in its history but the body of Senior Chief Ben Randall was never found. What makes a legend? Is it what someone did when they were alive... or how they're remembered after they're gone? Some people actually believe Senior Chief made the swim to the Aleutian Islands. He's standing on a distant beach somewhere with a fishing pole in his hand. But I found my answer a couple of weeks later..."" Weeks later Jake is again sent to rescue a man. Upon retrieval the victim keeps asking where the other man is. Jake realizes that 'someone' helped him staying with him until help came. ""He never let go"" the man said. Jake attributes this to Ben's presence and continues his narration. ""There's a legendof a man who lives beneath the sea. He's a fisher of men. A last hope for all those who have been left behind. He is known as The Guardian (Senior Chief Ben Randall). Ben Randall always said life is about making choices. In the end by making his he helped me make mine.""This narration Jake makes refers to being reunited with Emily for good. In saying so he visits Emily at the elementary school she teaches at. Because her class was interrupted by Jake Emily pauses her class approaches him and asks ""What are you doing here?"" Jake answers ""I lied to youI can't do casual."" There Emily kisses Jake happily."

However the criminals spot the police and the ensuing car chase cuts through the hillside shanty town vehicles destroying the shacks and causing large explosions.Ka-Kui persists in his chase eventually following on foot as the drug lord attempts to escape in a double-decker bus.

Chu Tao notices that the data is being dumped and he and his men head to the shopping mall to intervene. Ka-Kui who's monitoring Chu Tao's activities follows. In the ensuing fight Ka-Kui defeats all of Chu Tao's henchmen. The briefcase containing the computer data falls to the ground floor of the mall but Chu Tao retrieves it. Ka-Kui at the top floor leaps off a ledge and grabs a pole wrapped in lightbulbs. He rapidly slides down the pole smashing through the bulbs crashing through a glass ceiling and finally reaching the floor where he violently apprehends Chu Tao but is held back humorously by his two friends Tak and Kim to stop him from delivering one final kick to Chu Tao."

When Kirk Spock and McCoy investigate the disappearance of a doomed planet's population they find themselves trapped in different periods of that world's past.::Kenneth Chisholm
When the planet Sarpeidon is about to be destroyed by its star Beta Niobe becoming a supernova Kirk (William Shatner) Spock (Leonard Nimoy) and McCoy (DeForest Kelley) beam down and find it evacuated except for its librarian Mr. Atoz (Ian Wolfe) tending to his replicas. They are a collection of unusual discs which play the planet's history and (to their surprise) allow their users to travel into the past through the atavachron a time machine into the periods each was studying on disc. The crew travels unprepared McCoy and Spock find themselves locked in a frozen ice age 5000 years ago where Spock reverts to the barbaric age of the Vulcans. He becomes very easily agitated and is intensely attracted to the political prisoner Zarabeth (Mariette Hartley) who enjoys getting company but tells them return is impossible. Kirk arrives in a Cromwellian period where he's arrested and suspected of witchcraft. He soon realizes the magistrate must be a time traveler like him and learns not being prepared at molecular level he can return through the time portal and in fact must do so and contact Spock and Bones in a matter of hours; they must all return to the present and board the Enterprise before the exploding sun destroys the atavachron.::KGF Vissers
Kirk Spock and McCoy beam down to the planet Sarpeidon to learn what has happened to its population. The planet which will be completely destroyed when its sun goes supernova in a few hours time once had a thriving population but has now been reduced to one person the librarian Mr. Atoz. It would appear that the planet's entire population has gone back in time to a period of their choice in the planet's history. When the three crewman unknowingly have gone through the time portal Kirk ends up in a society similar to 17th century Earth while McCoy and Spock end up in a frozen ice age. With Kirk arrested and accused of witchcraft and the others having to survive the harsh Arctic-like climate they have only a short time to find their way back and return to the Enterprise before the planet explodes. For Mr. Spock he finds a time from before the existence of Vulcan and he's regressing to an emotional state.::garykmcd
Mere hours before Beta Niobe goes supernova Kirk Spock and McCoy beam down to its sole satellite Sarpeidon a class M planet whose large population incapable of space flight has nonetheless completely vanished. Only one active power source remains - a records archive manned by a lone librarian named Atoz along with several replicas of himself. By accident Kirk and party run headlong into the planet's secret - a time machine through which the doomed population escaped into its own past. Unfortunately Kirk gets stuck in its Reformation era arrested for witchcraft while Spock and McCoy find rescue from freezing in the planet's ice age through a political prisoner condemned to live alone. Not only have these involuntary travelers just hours to return to the Enterprise before the planet's destruction but their lack of due process by the library's atavachron will cause their deaths on a cellular level if they don't return. However Spock without the proper preparation has reverted back to the barbaric behavior of his ancestors.::statmanjeff
In Star Trek's penultimate episode Kirk Spock and McCoy find themselves transporting down to the planet Sarpeidon to investigate (and possibly help) a planet's evacuation before its sun goes supernova. However all they find is a single librarian Mr. Atoz tending a collection of unusual discs which play the planet's history and (to their surprise) allow their users to travel into the past. McCoy and Spock find themselves locked in the planet's ice age; Kirk finds himself locked in the planet's colonial age; and they must escape back into the present before the sun explodes and the library's computer is destroyed.

"The movie starts with Michael Jackson singing his hit song ""Man in the Mirror."" After that song is over a montage starts of Michael as a kid and works it's way up to present day. After the montage is over the music video for ""Bad"" is being remade by various child performers with the name ""Badder."" After the video is over the young Michael is walking out of the builiding he is in. Outside a claymation tourbus pulls up to the builiding. A large cloud of mist is seen on both sides of the builiding and when young Michael walks through he turns back into present day Michael. The people in the tourbus spots him and begin to chase him.After awhile of chasing Michael accidently runs into an area where they are filming a movie. The director yells at him and the two actors decide to chase him as well. Michael manages to hide in a wardrobe room and sneak out dressed as a bunny riding away on a bicycle. The paparazzi soon realize what happened and begin to chase Michael again. Michael's bike shifts into a Harley-Davidson motorcycle and the music video for ""Speed Demon"" begins. After Michael is sure he has lost his fans he stops in the desert and take off his bunny suit and sets in on a rock. He starts to walk away when something taps him on the shoulder. The bunny suit has come alive and it seems to challenge Michael to a dance contest. After a little dancing a police officer taps Michael on the shoulder and gives him a ticket Michael also noticed that the bunny has vanished. Michael gets on his motercycle and just before he rides away the mountain in front of him takes shape of the bunny and winks at him. Michael smiles back and drives away. Then the music video for ""Leave Me Alone"" starts.Once the ""Leave Me Alone"" segment is over the quite rare very long ""Smooth Criminal"" video begins. We see a full moon and three little kids on a rooftop looking at a builiding. Sean (Sean Lennon) Katie (Kellie Parker) and Zeke (Brandon Quintin Adams). Michael steps out of the builiding they are looking at and looks up at the sky. Then we see someone cracking a peanut in his hands and Michael looks over to them and dodges quickly as henchmen start shooting at him. The two boys in fright run away and Katie stays behind frozen. She starts shouting Michael's name and then we go to a flashback.We see Katie Sean and Zeke playing in a field with a soccer ball and along with Katie's dog Skipper. Someone kicks the ball and Skipper runs over picks it up with his mouth and runs into the woods. Michael goes to look for him and Katie comes along with him. They call out to Skipper who is no where to be seen. They soon find a section of the woods covered with nothing but spiderwebs and locate a secret tunnel inside a rock. They both follow it trying to be as quiet as possible. When they see people they stop on a staircase and look to see what they are talking about. They overhear someone who plans to get every child in the world hooked on drugs. The villan identifies himself as Franky LiDeo (Joe Pesci). Named Mr. Big for short. Katie sees a spider about to crawl on her arm and starts to scream. Mr. Big sees them and sends his gunmen after them.We go back to the building where Michael is trying to dodge the bullets being shot at him. After the gunmen stop shooting we see that Michael has gotten away and is running for his life. Katie notices this and runs off the building to find her two friends. After a while of running Michael is cornered in a dead end and Mr. Big and his guards go to kill him when Michael's lucky star goes by. His lucky star can make him do anything or turn into anything. Michael turns himself into a super fast car and speeds past his enemies escaping.We now see Katie entering an abandoned club and Sean and Zeke are both hiding there and greet her. They all claim Michael told them to meet him there earlier. They leave the club to make sure they are at the right place and they run behind a fence when they hear someone coming. Katie looks over and sees Michael transforming back into human form. She is in shock and after she gets better they all look up and see him entering the club. A burst of white light flashes and Michael enters. It turns out to be a lively crowded gangster-infested 1930s American nightclub. Michael is surprised by this and everyone in there is surprised to see him. Michael feels it is his job to entertain them and so he performs his hit song ""Smooth Criminal"". Despite the fact that the song ""Smooth Criminal"" is four minutes and seventeen seconds this scene is dragged out to be about ten minutes long. Towards the end of Michael's exciting performance Katie is kidnapped by Mr. Big while Sean and Zeke are still hiding behind the fence. Michael runs out to find what happened and they all go looking for her.They find Mr. Big's lair and enter trying to be as quiet as possible. Sean and Zeke stop while Michael goes ahead. Then a metal door closes behind him separating them. Michael runs to the center of the room and the boys go to the roof. A spotlight hits Michael and follows him until he is cornered. Then all the gunmen come out and point their guns at him and two guards go infront of him. We hear Katie screaming as she is coming up an elevator. Mr. Big has a hold of her and is hitting her several times. Michael tries to go to her but the guards hold him back. Mr. Big reveals that he ""just wants to get everybod high "" and is about to inject Katie with a drug when she scratches his face and runs to Michael. At the same time the guard takes the back of his gun hits Michael once in the stomach and once in the face. Giving him a concussion. Mr. Big catches Katie and pulls her back turns Michael over and kicks him once in the chest. Michael is on the floor in pain and Katie tries to crawl away but is stoppped Mr. Big orders the men to kill her first. Michael screams at him to leave her alone when his lucky star flies by and he transforms into a giant robot! Mr. Big manages to escape after Michael has killed all of the guards. Including the guard that was keeping Sean and Zeke on the roof. Michael then turns himself into a space ship and kills Mr. Big when he tries to kill him with a cannon. The kids are confused as to why they were left behind and say goodbye to Michael as he flies away thinking they would never see him again.We then see the kids sitting on a bench in the street saying how much they miss him. Katie gets up to sit in a corner and she says to herself that she wishes he would come back. Just then we see mist and Michael appears out of nowhere. They all see him and run to him in happiness. He tells them to follow him and he leads them to the club informing them that there is a surprise in store. Once again a burst of white light flashes when they enter. It is at this point when the quite rare very long ""Smooth Criminal"" video ends and the ""Come Together"" sequence begins. This is where the kids get Skipper back and Michael performs his closing song ""Come Together.""

An apprentice farmer (Sammo Hung) ventures to the city and helps his family battle a gang of thugs.
"Jennifer Spencer (Sondra Locke) and her little sister were gang raped years ago after a female friend of the gang had persuaded them to come to the fair. The brutal rape left the sister permanently catatonic and almost vegetative. Jennifer is now out for revenge.In the beginning of the film Jennifer is seen with one of the rapists George Wilburn (Michael Maurer). It is early morning and she is with him in a car out on the cliffs. She pulls out a nickel-plated Colt Detective Special revolver and shoots him twice - one time in the groin and one time in the head at point-blank range then leaves the scene.Inspector Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) in the meantime is seen in a court room where he has brought a young blonde haired suspect named Mr. Hawkins (Kevyn Major Howard) to trial. The case is dismissed as a travesty because Harry did not have the right to seize the evidence used to prove Hawkins guilty.After insulting Hawkins in the elevator Harry goes to his usual coffee diner and orders the usual black coffee. The waitress tries getting his attention by pouring massive amounts of sugar into his coffee and Harry who is reading a newspaper does not notice. As he walks out he takes a sip of coffee and spits it out in disgust. As he returns to complain he sees that the open signs were switched to closed. A robbery ensues but Harry stops it going in the back way where he shoots up the gang of robbers. One is left alive and grabs the waitress as a human shield but Harry points his .44 Magnum handgun revolver at him and dares the thug to shoot her in order for Harry to justify killing the thug (""Go ahead... make my day!"" ) The police arrive shortly afterward when the robber drops his gun.Meanwhile Jennifer is at an art exhibit where some of her paintings are put on display but she claims to the owner that she must miss it because she needs to visit someone up north. She goes to the hospital to visit her sister Elizabeth (Lisa Britt) whom the doctor says is in a permanent vegetative state. Jennifer tells her sister of what she did to George Wilburn and then leaves.Later that night Harry is at a mobster named Threlkis's granddaughter's wedding party. Harry antagonizes Threlkis (Michael V. Gazzo) in front of his own granddaughter accusing him of killing a young hooker. Threlkis freaks as Callahan pulls out papers where he claims the hooker may have confessed everything and he dies of a heart attack right at the table. Harry walks away and it is revealed that the papers are blank.The following day Callahan and the rest of the cops are investigating the car containing the deceased George Wilburn in it. Shortly afterwards Callahan is talking to his superiors Captain Briggs (Bradford Dillman) Lt. Donnelly (Michael Currie) and the Chief (Bill Reddick). He is lectured about how he handled the Threlkis case and Callahan is defensive on how that case was his to handle. His superiors demand that Callahan relax and take a vacation.After Callahan leaves a restaurant that night he is attacked by four of Threlkis's hitmen. After killing three of them one escapes in his car. Lt. Donnelly then orders Callahan to not be so reckless and demands he take a break with ""peace"". Out in the forest Callahan practices shooting with his brand new .44 Automag handgun a powerful .44 caliber semi-automatic pistol which fires more rapidly and accurately than his .44 Magnum revolver. His friend Horace King (Albert Popwell) shows up shortly afterwards to talk to him convincing him he has the best place for Callahan to go for a vacation.Driving home late at night Callahan is attacked by Hawkins and his friends who try to kill him with a Molotov cocktail. Harry manages to get out of his car and throws the cocktail into Hawkins' car causing him to drive off a pier into the water where Hawkins and his friends drown.Lt. Donnelly sees that this is the last straw and orders Callahan to investigate the Wilburn killing in his hometown. Callahan reluctantly agrees and is sent on ""vacation"" to the town San Paulo a coastal resort town down the California coast. What he does not know is that Jennifer Spencer has also gone down to San Paulo to fully exact revenge on her rapists who live there. Her story for staying at San Paulo is that she's renewing the carousel house and painting the merry-go-round horses at the fairgrounds. While walking on the beach at the fairgrounds there is a flashback of Jennifer's rape and it is shown what actually happened 10 years ago right on the beach near the fairgrounds.During the time in San Paulo Callahan receives a bulldog named Meathead from his friend Horace. He also stops a bank robbery in progress when he arrives and he saves the life of young Officer Bennett (Mark Keyloun). While taking his dog Meathead for a walk he runs into Jennifer (who falls off of her bicycle when Meathead barks at her). Unaware of each other's true identity the two have a brief exchange of words and then part. At night Callahan walks into a bar for a beer and meets the malicious Ray Parkins (Audrie Neenan) a butch lesbian. After insulting Ray Callahan demands to know if anyone knows George Wilburn. When he tells how Wilburn died Ray just starts a raucous laughter which pursues to a laugh riot.The next morning another rapist Kruger (Jack Thibeau) goes fishing at the beach. Jennifer follows him. She steps in front of Kruger who recognizes her right before she shoots him in the groin. She then shoots him in the head and he falls over in his chair. When his body is reported to the cops Callahan shows up only to be shooed away by Chief Lester Jannings (Pat Hingle) for continually interfering with the San Paulo's police job. At the station Callahan asks Bennett to find out anything he knows about the case. Harry finds a picture of Jannings's son Alby's friends on the wall and he has Bennett investigate that too. At dusk Callahan stops by Mrs. Kruger's (Nancy Parsons) fish market to question her about the Wilburn and Kruger murders only to be kicked out after brawling with her brothers Eddie (Russ McCubbin) and Carl (Robert Sutton).Callahan is attacked by the surviving hitman who was hired by Threlkis but manages to shoot him in advance after being tipped off to his presence by Meathead. Ray eventually talks to Tyrone (Wendell Wellman) another rapist about what is happening. Tyrone disregards her warning and tells her to leave his store. Later that day Tyrone is confronted by Jennifer in his garage. He tries to reason with her as she steps closer her gun drawn. Realizing she isn't standing down Tyrone grabs for his own gun at which point Jennifer guns him down.Callahan meets up with Jennifer again this time at an outdoor restaurant. The two talk again in a more polite manner and converse about the murders. Upon hearing Callahan is a cop Jennifer becomes worried that he is on to her.Now with Wilburn Kruger and Tyrone dead Ray calls Mick (Paul Drake) the leader of the rapists to come down for help from Las Vegas where he lives. When Callahan finds Tyrone's body he heads over to Ray's house at night and sees Jennifer's car parked out front. Jennifer hides and Callahan goes inside to find Ray. Mick attacks Callahan and after a brawl Callahan takes Mick away. Once they are gone Jennifer sneaks into the house and confronts Ray. Ray sips a soda and asks her ""So tell me how's your slut sister?"" Jennifer replies by shooting her in the heart and then in the head.Meanwhile Mick is bailed out by Eddie and Carl while Callahan returns to Ray Parkins's house only to find the woman dead. Horace is seen driving up to Callahan's motel that same night to visit him he is carrying his powerful shotgun and some alcohol. Upon arrival into Callahan's room Horace is greeted by Mick Eddie and Carl who slit his throat and steal his shotgun.After buying a few beers Callahan meets up with Jennifer late at night by the pier. The two talk and this time Jennifer invites Callahan up for a drink at her place where he sleeps with her. After a brief sleep Harry gets out of bed when it is still dark. In the garage he sees Jennifer's car and recognizes it as the one that was parked at Ray's house before. Harry goes to Mrs. Kruger's fish market after Officer Bennett informs him that Eddie and Carl bailed Mick out.As Callahan leaves after receiving no cooperation from the hostile Mrs. Kruger he is ambushed by Mick Eddie and Carl on a pier. A melee ensues with Callahan being viciously beaten and dumped into the water... his .44 Magnum handgun lost.Jennifer is then seen going to Janning's house to eliminate Alby (Matthew Child). She prepares to kill Alby only to find out that Alby is in a vegetative state just like her own sister. Jennifer is stopped cold by Jannings who orders her to drop her gun. After doing so Jannings explains how he covered up the rape because he was a public figure and the guilt drove Alby insane which caused him to crash his car into a wall rendering him a mute quadriplegic. Suddenly Mick arrives with Eddie and Carl who take Jennifer hostage with her own weapon. As they are starting to leave Mick shoots and kills Jannings with Jennifer's gun when Jannings tries to pull out a gun. He assures Eddie and Carl that it's a ""freebie"".As this is happening the bloodied and battered Callahan returns to his motel room to find Horace's dead body and Meathead limping after being attacked by Mick and his gang. Enraged Callahan opens his drawer and prepares his replacement weapon: his powerful .44 Automag handgun. He then leaves to find and kill the thugs responsible.Mick Eddie and Carl set to gang-rape Jennifer again at the same fairground where she was raped a decade earlier. After a struggle Jennifer escapes and runs through the deserted fairground and seeks shelter in the carousel where she turns it on and hides in it. Fleeing from the merry-go-round Jennifer runs out followed by Mick Eddie and Carl but Callahan's silhouette appears on the boardwalk... armed with the large .44 Automag. While Eddie and Carl are quickly taken down Mick grabs Jennifer as a shield. With nowhere left to go Mick forces her up onto the Giant Dipper roller coaster and Mick taunts Callahan as he holds his gun on Jennifer. Harry repeats the phrase he said earlier in the diner holdup ""Go ahead make my day."" Mick gets too cocky and Jennifer quickly punches him giving Callahan a clear opening. He fires off four rounds which all hit Mick. Mick stumbles backwards crashes through the support railing and falls onto the still operating carousel and is impaled on a unicorn's horn.Justice is finally given to Jennifer at the end of the movie. When asked by Officer Bennett about the revolver found on Mick's body... the one belonging to Jennifer... Callahan lets Mick be misidentified as the killer. He tells Bennett the gun ought to be run through Ballistics; he thinks it's the gun that killed the Chief. He knows that once Ballistics compares the bullets from Jannings Tyrone and Kruger Mick will be blamed for all the murders and the police will close the books on them thus safeguarding Jennifer. As the camera pulls back Harry and Jennifer walk slowly away down the boardwalk."
