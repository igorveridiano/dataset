"A township near Cape Town. Two young teens, Madiba and Sipho, find a gun and a camera. Sipho takes the gun, and Madiba the camera, sealing their fate.::anonymous"
"Kayelitsha, South-Africa, today. 2003 A township, close to Cape-town, after the end of Apartheid. Two kids, 14, Madiba and Sipho play along the railway. A train passes by. A dead man rolls to their feet. On him, they find a gun and a video camera. Sipho takes the gun and Madiba the camera. Their destiny is sealed. Benny, their friend makes a wooden camera and Madiba hides the video inside, in order to avoid embarrassing questions, racketing etc. He starts filming the township and its inhabitants. He discovers the strange beauty of his life's setting. Sipho, the boss, brings his friends to Cape-town, the white city, so close, so far, so exotic to the eyes of the children. While Sipho forms a gang with the street children and makes all kinds of illicit trading, Madiba films the town, its huge buildings, its business life, and its luxury. In a bookstore, he films a young white girl, stealing a book. They look at each other. Going out of the store, she drops book on road, knowing he will pick it up. In it she has written a message. Estelle belongs to a traditional Cape-townian white family. Her father is a famous doctor. Comfortable life. Prejudices not really questioned by the change of regime. Estelle is dying to breathe the air of the new times. Her family doesn't allow her to do so. She rebels, between a few lessons of music given by Mr. Shawn, an old humanist who makes no difference between Blacks and Whites. He teaches in townships and has done so since the days of Apartheid. Estelle thinks of Madiba, this funny boy, with his strange camera and his apparent sensibility. Sipho who is now addicted to glue as much as to street trafficking, becomes the chief of his small gang. Madiba films incessantly. He dreams also of this young white girl who has held out her hand to him. They meet again some days later, and slowly a strong friendship starts between them. From the first steps of a young cinematographer who changes the perception of his township to the tragic end of Sipho, the good-hearted bad boy, THE WOODEN CAMERA tells the story of a friendship between two kids, not understood by their parents who refuse what seems to them like a compromise with the enemy. It will take all the determination of the kids and the intelligence of Mr. Shawn, who knows that music has no colour, to give a chance to the impossible. Sipho commits a hold-up and is shot dead, while Madiba & Estelle try to find their way into the future through art and love::Olivier Delahaye"

"In an African jungle strange enough to have a roaring butterfly, Inki the boy hunter, a lion with false teeth and a magical minah bird match wits.::J. Spurlin"
"Once again, the mysterious minah bird hops his syncopated way into Inki's lion-hunting expedition. This time the little black bird has a new reality- defying way to disappear: he hops into a haystack which gradually (and with the same catchy hip-hop) shrinks down to a single straw, which vanishes.::Paul Penna <tterrace@wco.com>"
"A worm and a butterfly frolic merrily through the jungle until the mighty hunter enters the scene with his fearsome spear. Well, maybe he's not so mighty. Inki is a small boy learning an essential skill by starting out small. But in this strange never-land of an African jungle, even a butterfly can roar like a lion and send the would-be hunter fleeing into the distance. Speaking of lions, Inki the hunter becomes Inki the hunted when the king of the jungle gets a whiff of him. But it's unclear whether Inki's greatest threat is the big cat or a small minah bird. Hopping on odd beats of a Mendelssohn tune, the placid bird, capable of magic disappearances and surreal reappearances, causes trouble for man and beast alike, and is not above filching a steak or a pair of false teeth, in the process.::J. Spurlin"
"Wile E. Coyote hopes to catch the Road Runner using a mallet, a cooking pan, a TNT stick, a balloon, and a piano dropped from a precipice. The last of these results in Wile E. falling to the road below along with the piano and ending up with 88 teeth.::Kevin McCorry <mmccorry@nb.sympatico.ca>"
"Wile E. Coyote's bad luck and ill-fated attempts to catch the Road Runner continues. This time, Wile E. actually corrals his ever-elusive prey beneath a cooking pan and after doing so, tosses a lighted dynamite stick beneath it...only to find he never caught the Road Runner and all that's waiting for him is an explosion. Other tricks which fail the Coyote dumping birdseed at a railroad crossing (he gets hit by a speeding train); placing a roll of dynamite sticks beneath a bridge (the binded roll simply rolls toward Wile E.'s detonator); and hoisting a large concert grand piano above the road to drop on the Road Runner (it doesn't budge until the Coyote gets on top and takes another ride over a cliff). Finally, Wile E. sets up a Rube-like device to drop a cannon ball on top of an unsuspecting Road Runner...the result similar to the other schemes. Later, Wile E. plants dynamite sticks beneath a bridge, but the binded roll of sticks roll toward him, and the coyote the TNT-control box tries to drop a concert-sized grand piano::Brian Rathjen <briguy_52732@yahoo.com>"
