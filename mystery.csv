"This movie is a very good thriller, for the most part. Just cryptic enough, most of the riddles are easy enough to figure out, though some of them hard enough you run out of time if you don't pause the movie. But the biggest mystery of all is the ending, which could be seen as a continuation of the theme of the movie, or it could be seen as a case of a writer running out of good ideas. In the end, it does mirror one of the first riddles presented, as what it delivers IS the answer to that riddle. In doing this the film comes full circle, which OUGHT TO be very satisfying. However, because of what the ending DOES you, the excellent plot doesn't matter, when the movie ends you are left with the same thing as you are in real life when you die.Sara Novak is a college student whose mother died in a car accident. She is haunted by her inability to understand why such random tragedies happen, and when she stumbles upon a game that promises to provide the answer, she plays along. The Nemesis Game is played by following a series of riddles left to her by anonymous people, if you solve the riddles you are led to an abandoned building, and when you solve the final riddle and write the answer on the wall, you will see the ""Design""' of life and understand why bad things happen. Sara meets a group of people who are involved in the game, and eventually reaches the end of it. However, she doesn't get a chance to write HER answer on the wall. But it doesn't matter, she receives the same thing as everyone who reaches this stage i life, and she personally experiences the central metaphor of the Game; That life itself is a game, you play your part, and then you die. There IS no understanding other than that, and as most people do realize at some level ""In life also there IS no understanding, life is about NOT understanding but going on living anyway"". And what IS the surprise ending that is finally delivered that wraps up the otherwise excellent plot? What ARE you left with as an explanation to the twists and turns of the movie? It's the answer to the riddle ""what do the poor have, the rich want, and God fears?""'Nothing'"

"Under the watchful eyes of Father Silvano Bentivoglio and Dr. Vittoria Vetra, the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) initiates the Large Hadron Collider and captures three vials of antimatter. Immediately afterward, someone kills Father Silvano, using his retina to infiltrate the containment chamber, and steals one vial.The Roman Catholic Church mourns the death of Pope Pius XVI in Rome. Vatican City prepares for the College of Cardinals' papal conclave, which will select the next Pope. Until that time, Camerlengo Patrick McKenna, a papal court official and former helicopter pilot, assumes temporary control of the Vatican. Reporters, nuns, priests, and other faithful members of the Church crowd into Saint Peter's Square, waiting for the white smoke from the conclave, signalling a successful vote. But the Illuminati, a 400-year old, underground secret society, kidnap the four most likely candidates before the conclave enters seclusion. The Illuminati threaten to kill one every hour, beginning at 8:00 pm, and then destroy the Vatican in a burst of light at midnight. A stolen security camera shows the missing antimatter vial, which will catastrophically explode when the vial's battery dies and the magnetic containment field fails.The Vatican summons symbologist Robert Langdon from Harvard University and Vittoria Vetra from CERN to help them solve the Illuminati's threat, save the four preferiti, and replace the vial's batteries. Langdon listens to the Illuminati message and deduces that the four cardinals will die at the four altars of the ""Path of Illumination."" However, no one knows where these altars are located. Vetra demands that Commander Richter, the commandant of the Swiss Guard, to bring Father Silvano's diaries from Switzerland, hoping that they contain the name of the person with whom Silvano discussed the antimatter experiment. Langdon also demands access to the Vatican Secret Archives (something he has requested for 10 years) to see the original copy of Galileo Galilei's banned book, which may contain the locations of the four ""altars of science."" Using the clues from this book, Langdon, Vetra, Inspector General Ernesto Olivetti, and Lieutenant Valenti of the Vatican Gendarmerie Corps race to the first church, only to find the first cardinal, Cardinal Ebner, dead, suffocated with dirt, eaten by rats and branded with the word ""Earth."" They verify the second altar's location and arrive, only to witness the death of the second cardinal, Cardinal Lamassa, his lungs lacerated and his body branded with the word ""Air."" While Vetra studies Silvano's diaries, Langdon and the Vatican officers locate the third church and try to save the third cardinal, Cardinal Gudiera, from burning to death, but the assassin appears and kills everyone but Langdon. The cardinal succumbs to the flames, his body branded with the word ""Fire.""After escaping, Langdon convinces two Carabinieri officers to race with him to the last church of the ""Water"" altar, but the assassin murders the officers and drops the fourth cardinal, Cardinal Baggia, into the Fountain of the Four Rivers. However, Langdon saves the cardinal, who tells him the location of the Illuminati's lair: Castel Sant'Angelo. When Langdon and Vetra arrive, they are confronted by the assassin, who spares their lives since they are not armed and he has not been paid to kill them. He reveals that his contractors were from the Catholic Church. The assassin escapes and finds a vehicle containing his payment, but is killed by a car bomb upon igniting the engine. Langdon and Vetra discover that the final victim of the plot will be Camerlengo McKenna. After arriving at the Vatican via a secret passage, they and some Swiss Guards enter the Camerlengo's office and find him in the floor branded with the Vatican's symbol on his chest and Commander Richter near him with a gun. The Guards promptly kill Richter to save the camerlengo. During the confusion, the dying commander gives Langdon a key to his office. Then the camerlengo, Langdon, Vetra, and the Swiss Guards discover the location of the stolen antimatter vial. By the time they find it, the battery is about to expire, the deadly explosion just minutes away. The camerlengo seizes the vial and uses a helicopter meant for escape from the Vatican to fly above the church. He then activates the autopilot and escapes with a parachute. After several seconds, the bomb explodes and the camerlengo lands, now considered a hero by the crowd and even as the best candidate to be the new Pope by the College of Cardinals. Meanwhile, Langdon and Vetra use Richter's key to watch a security video showing that the mastermind behind the murders of the original Pope and the preferiti and the antimatter robbery, in fact, is the camerlengo and not the Illuminati. While Richter tries to arrest McKenna, the priest brands himself with a seal that resembles Saint Peter's upside-down crucifixion and accuses the commander being a member of the Illuminati. Langdon shows the video to the College. After the camerlengo realizes his plot has been uncovered, he immolates himself with oil from one of the 99 holy lamps inside St. Peter's Basilica.The Vatican announces that the camerlengo died due to internal wounds suffered during his landing, while the public demands he be canonized. The College designate the Cardinal Baggia as the new Pope (who chooses to take on the name Luke), and Cardinal Strauss as the new camerlengo. The new camerlengo thanks Robert Langdon for saving the Vatican and the new Pope, and as a mark of his gratitude loans Galileo's ""Diagramma Veritas"" to Langdon for his reference. The film ends with the new Pope walking out on the balcony to the cheering crowd in St. Peter's Square."

"In the opening scene (filmed in black and white) during an unseasonably balmy Christmas season, English professor Dexter ""Dex"" Cornell (Dennis Quaid) stumbles into a police station to report his own murder and describe the events of the past 36 hours....In class, Dex's lecture is upstaged by his star pupil, Nicholas ""Nick"" Lang (Robert Knepper), a precocious intellectual who has just completed his first novel, 'Out of Whack.' Nick is desperate for Dex to read the manuscript, and claims his professor's feedback is a matter of life and death. However, Dex avoids the novel. He has been suffering writer's block for years, and the boy's talent reminds him of his own shortcomings. As Dex settles into his office and gives 'Out of Whack' an ""A"" grade without reading it, he is startled by the thud of a body crashing into the window, and realizes that Nick has thrown himself off the rooftop to commit suicide.Shortly thereafter, Dex's colleague, Hal Petersham (Daniel Stern), comes to the office with a bottle of whiskey. He pours the liquor into a coffee mug and hands it to Dex, who tells him about Nick's troubled past. The boy's father tried to rob a tycoon named Mr. Fitzwaring, and both men were killed during the break in. Despite the tragedy, Mrs. Fitzwaring took pity on Nick and financed his college education. Dex decides to read 'Out of Whack' after all, and takes it home where his wife, Gail (Jane Kaczmarek), reminds him to sign their divorce papers. Dex wants to save the marriage, but Gail complains that he lost his integrity and his romantic vitality when he stopped writing. As Gail leaves, she chides Dex's apathy, and accuses him of exchanging alcohol for ambition. Dex fails to sign the divorce papers and returns to campus, where he unexpectedly reunites with Gail at the opening of the Fitzwaring Art Gallery.When Mrs. Fitzwaring makes an inaugural speech that mourns Nick's death, Gail learns about the suicide, becomes ill, and is escorted home by Hal Petersham and his girl friend, Dr. Elaine Wells (Elizabeth Arden). Looking for more alcohol, Dex goes to the Continental Club and sits next to a young woman, unaware that she is Mrs. Fitzwaring's daughter, ""Cookie."" (Robin Johnson) As Cookie offers Dex a martini and starts to cry, a man named Bernard (Christopher Neame) drags her away, and Dex is spotted by one of his female students, Sydney Fuller (Meg Ryan). The girl is infatuated with Dex and encourages him to drink.The next morning, Dex awakens in Sydney's dormitory bedroom and is relieved to learn their evening was platonic. Dex telephones Gail, and she confesses she once had an affair with Nick Lang. Unfazed, Dex declares his love, but Gail discourages him from coming home and finds Nick's novel, 'Out of Whack,' in his briefcase. As Dex hangs up the telephone, he is overcome with vertigo and goes to the hospital, where he discovers he has been poisoned with a lethal dosage of radium chloride. Dr. Elaine Wells declares that Dex ingested the chemical compound in an alcoholic beverage, and regrets he has one day to live.Dex races home with renewed appreciation for life and reunites with Gail. However, she is hit over the head by an intruder and dies. Police arrive at the scene and notice Nick's 'Out of Whack' manuscript, burning in the fireplace. The detectives are aware of Gail's affair, and accuse Dex of murdering his wife to exact revenge. They reveal that Nick did not commit suicide, after all, and assume that Dex pushed his student off the roof.As Dr. Elaine Wells tries to sedate Dex with an intravenous drug, he grabs the needle, threatens to hold her hostage, and escapes to Sydney's dormitory. He accuses the girl of poisoning him, but she insists she is innocent, and he loses consciousness. When Dex awakens, he explains his predicament, douses his hand in super glue, and grabs Sydney's wrist, creating a bond so she cannot get away.After a series of false leads, the two go to Nick's funeral, where Dex recognizes Cookie Fitzwaring from the bar and realizes she was also Nick's lover. Dex corners Cookie and accuses her of poisoning his martini, but her mother's chauffeur, Bernard, comes to the girl's rescue. Dodging gunfire from an unseen assassin, Dex and Sydney run away, and Sydney is caught in an open elevator shaft. As she dangles from the conveyor, her skin rips away from Dex's hand and they escape together.Dex sends Sydney home in a taxicab and goes to the Fitzwaring mansion, where he confronts Mrs. Fitzwaring (Charlotte Rampling) and Bernard in the horse stable. Just then, Cookie arrives and holds her mother at gunpoint, accusing her of killing Nick. In the ensuing commotion, Bernard knocks Dex unconscious and he comes to in the back seat of a car. Bernard drives Dex back to the university and they pick up Cookie, but the girl is drunk and out of control. Still, Dex is convinced of her innocence and pushes Bernard out the car door in an attempt to get away. Cookie takes over the steering wheel. Bernard jumps on the roof, but his gun misfires, accidentally shooting her dead. The car plummets into a tar pit and sinks while Bernard continues to fight. Dex throws him back into the muck, grabs his gun, and stumbles to a campus carnival. He is hassled by a crowd of impudent co-eds, but Sydney comes to his rescue, and they go back to his office to make love.When Sydney falls asleep, Dex returns to the Fitzwaring mansion and confronts Mrs. Fitzwaring, who has just learned about her daughter's death and reveals the true story of her relationship with Nick. Mrs. Fitzwaring was once married to Nick's father, but she abandoned him after she gave birth to Nick, and secretly assumed a new identity as Mrs. Fitzwaring. Nick's father tracked her down at the mansion and revealed her ruse to Mr. Fitzwaring, who threatened to destroy her relationship with Cookie. Mrs. Fitzwaring murdered both men, and vowing to protect her secret, Bernard invented the story of the break-in. Mrs. Fitzwaring laments the loss of both children and commits suicide, making Dex a witness to yet another killing. Dex is enraged by the wasted lives, and his failure to identify the murderer.Dex returns to his office and ransacks the bookshelves in a tantrum, then soothes himself with a drink from Hal's whiskey bottle. Remembering that Hal poured the liquor into a coffee mug before giving it to him on the afternoon of Nick's death, Dex telephones his friend and orders him to come to the office. When Hal arrives, he refuses to taste the whiskey and Dex realizes he is the killer. Hal explains his plans to publish Nick's novel under his own name. He was obliged to kill Gail, and poison Dex, because they knew about 'Out of Whack' and were likely to expose his deception. A fight ensues, and Dex shoots Hal in the chest. Hal plunges through the window to his death.In the end, back at the police station (in black-and-white), Dex concludes his story to the investigating detectives. The final shot shows Dex walking out of the police station along a long hallway to meet his fate.(One interpretation is that he might have died right there at the station and is walking down the station hallway to the light of Heaven.)"

Longdale says that he told Velvet that Tom might come looking for them. Realizing that the snuff film was authentic, the private eye knows he is at risk. Velvet and Machine produce a bound and beaten Max, whom they abducted to force Tom to bring them the only surviving copy of the illegal film. Once he delivers it, but before he turns it over, they kill Max and beat Tom and then burn the film. As they are about to kill Tom, he tells them that Christian had paid $1 million for the film and that the reason Christian wanted the film made was for the simple reason that he had enough money to make it possible. Velvet, Poole, and Machine received much less and that Longdale kept the major portion. In an ensuing fight, Velvet and Longdale are both killed; Tom wounds Machine and escapes.He calls Mrs. Christian to tell her his discoveries and recommends going to the police, to which she agrees. Arriving at her estate, Tom is told that Mrs. Christian committed suicide after hearing the news. She left envelopes for the Mathews family and Tom: it contains the rest of his payment and a note reading, ""Try to forget us.""Tom decides to seek justice for the murdered girl by killing the remaining people involved. Tracking down Eddie, Tom takes him to the shooting location and tries to kill him. He calls Mrs. Mathews to tell her about her daughter and asks for her permission to punish those responsible. With that, he returns and beats Eddie to death with his pistol, before burning his body and pornography from his car. Tom traces Machine and attacks him at home. Tom unmasks him, revealing a bald, bespectacled man named George. He says, ""What did you expect? A monster?"" George goes on to tell Tom that he has no ulterior motive for his sadistic actions; he does them simply because he enjoys it. They struggle, and Tom kills him.After returning to his family, Tom receives a letter from Mrs. Mathews, thanking him and suggesting he and she were the only ones to care about Mary Ann.

"Lina McLaidlaw (Joan Fontaine) is a prim, proper English lady, and Johnnie Aysgarth (Cary Grant) is a suave, charming playboy. They're as surprised as anyone when they fall madly in love with each other, but since Lina's stuffy parents would never approve of her romance with a cad like Aysgarth, she must elope. Setting up a lovely home after a whirlwind honeymoon on the Continent, Lina begins to see another side of Johnnie; his charm and bonhomie hide the fact that he's not only broke, but a very accomplished liar.Worried about their future, Lina presses Johnnie to find employment, and when he comes home one day showering expensive gifts on her, she believes his story of working for an obscure cousin, managing his estates. Dropping in one day at the office of this cousin, Lina is shocked to find that Johnnie was discharged weeks ago, and is told that she need not worry, as his former employee will not prosecute, at least not at this time.Johnnie always manages to allay Lina's fears with his charm, but she trusts him less and less. One of his old school chums, 'Beaky' Thwaite (Nigel Bruce) has dropped in for a long visit, and Lina begins to suspect the the two of them are cooking up some scheme to cover Johnnie's gambling debts. Beaky has money but little business sense, while Johnnie is always thinking about making money without actually working for it. They have a plan to buy some rocky coastline property and develop a seaside resort, but Johnnie changes his mind at the last minute, so he and Beaky must go to London to dissolve their business arrangement.Lina's suspicions get the better of her as she imagines Beaky meeting an untimely death on the dangerous road along the coast.

When the police come calling a day later, she learns that Beaky has indeed died mysteriously, and when Johnnie returns she finds she can no longer trust him. She cannot even stay in the same room at night with him, and when he brings a simple glass of milk to her before bed, Lina is filled with dread. She fears that Johnnie now plots to poison her, and collect the money from her life insurance.Trying to get away while she still can, she tells Johnnie she must visit her Mother. Johnnie is angry with her, but insists on driving her down the same dangerous coastal road, lined with its jagged cliffs.They speed along, Johnnie drives faster and faster, skirting the edge of the cliff, and veering at the last second down a ""shortcut"". Lina can only ride along in terror of what Johnnie has planned.As he swerves around a curve, Lina's door falls open and she nearly tumbles out over the edge of the cliff. Screaming, she clings to the car, as Johnnie's hand reaches over. Siezed with terror, she tries to avoid being pushed out, but he lunges at her, and at the last instant pulls her back into the car.Skidding to a stop, he demands to know what's gotten into her. ""How much can a man stand?"" he asks. Gradually, understanding comes over her, and as Johnnie explains, she realizes that he had nothing to do with Beaky's death, and that his fascination with poison is centered on himself. He meant to commit suicide rather than face his insurmountable debts, and spare his beloved Lina the shame of seeing him in prison. Clinging to him, she vows that they will face the future together, and they turn the car around for home.

"NOTE: Sequel to ""El Vampiro"" (1957)Doctor Mendoza [Carlos Ancira] has heard so much about the vampire encountered by his colleague, Doctor Enrique Zaldívar [Abel Salazar], at Marta González's [Ariadna Welter] hacienda that he and his henchman, ex-con Barraza [Yeire Beirute], went back to Sierra Negra and found the coffin. Mendoza knows that the corpse is that of a vampire because it has no reflection in a mirror...or rather, the flesh has no reflection. Although Count Lavud's [Germán Robles] body looks as fresh to the eye as the day he was destroyed, all that reflects in a mirror is his skeleton. Consequently, Mendoza is bringing the corpse to Louis Pasteur Hospital in order to conduct experiments on it and find out how much of the vampire legend is true. Are vampires really sensitive to the sun? Do they really need to drink blood? Can they really turn into bats? Are they really immortal?On the other hand, Enrique adheres to his original belief that Duval
is simply a normal person with a liking for blood. Enrique's almost
convinced Marta of the same. He's been treating her and is, in fact,
planning to release her from the hospital tomorrow so that she can go back
to the Teatro (theater) where she works as a dancer. That is, until
Mendoza brings Duval's corpse to the hospital. At first, Enrique is
outraged that his colleague would engage in grave-robbing, but he
eventually agrees to help on the condition that they burn the body at the
end of the experiments. When they leave the room in order to get the
instruments for dissection, however, Barraza climbs in the window, opens
the coffin, and attempts to remove an ornate brooch from around Duval's
neck. In doing so, he dislodges the stake, Lavud revives, makes a renfield
out of Barraza, and escapes.Marta's aunt María Teresa [Alicia Montoya], who witnessed Mendoza and Barraza carting
away the coffin and tried to stop them, comes to the hospital to warn
Enrique that Duval's body has been stolen. When she hears that the coffin
is actually at that very hospital, she especially fears for Marta because
Marta has already been bitten once by Duval. If she's bitten again, she
will turn into a vampire, so the three of them -- Enrique, María Teresa,
and Mendoza -- comb the hospital for Lavud. It is too late, however, for
Lavud has been wandering the halls and come upon a little girl lying
asleep in her hosital bed. As he bends over to bite her neck, she awakens
and screams. Lavud runs to another room and is surprised to see Marta
standing before him. Lavud sees fate knocking and hypnotizes her to obey
his will. By the time Enrique comes to her room, Marta is passed out on
the floor and Lavud has disappeared.Meanwhile at the Museo de Cera (wax museum), a tour group is being
introduced to the wax figures of murderers and instruments of execution,
such as the gallows, the guillotine. and the Virgin of Nuremberg, an iron
maiden fitten with eight inch spears embedded in the door. After the tour
is over and the group has left, the guide is surprised to see his old
cellmate Barraza standing among the wax figures. Barraza needs a place to
stay, and the basement of the Museo will do just fine, thank you, or else.
Shortly thereafter, María Teresa and Mendoza come knocking on the Museo
door, looking for Lavud's corpse. While Barraza and Mendoza search among
the figures, María Teresa makes her way down into the basement where she
finds Lavud's coffin. Unfortunately, Lavud has been following them, too.
When María Teresa finds the coffin and calls to Mendoza for help, Lavud
strangles Mendoza. María Teresa attempts to hide in the iron maiden, but
Barraza sees her shawl hanging out and closes the door on her, killing her
instantly.Meanwhile, back at the hospital, Enrique has been trying to explain
to the director about the vampire, but he is not believed, particularly
now that the body, the coffin, and Dr Mendoza have all disappeared.
Concerned for Marta's safety, Enrique makes her sit up with him, drinking
coffee and smoking cigarettes, waiting for dawn. Marta reveals that she
saw Duval in her room earlier that evening and wants to know what is going
on. As Enrique explains about Mendoza bringing the vampire's body to the
hospital, neither of them realizes that Duval is standing outside the
door, mentally calling to Marta. Fortunately, Enrique intercepts her as
she tries to leave the room. Thwarted and with dawn almost upon him, Duval
returns to his coffin in the basement of the Museo.In the morning, Marta is released from the hospital and returns to
the theater with Enrique in tow. That evening, Lavud locates the theater
where Marta is rehearsing and has a bite to drink from the cafe across the
street. Enrique is summoned to tend to Lavud's dinner and recognizes the
telltale bites on her neck. When he tells the police that the girl died
from a vampire's bite, they don't believe him. Meanwhile, rehearsal has
ended, and Marta is primping in her dressing room. Suddenly, Lavud
appears. He removes the brooch from his neck and swings it in front of
Marta's eyes, placing her in a trance, then places the brooch on her neck
just as Enrique returns. When Enrique sees the brooch on Marta's neck, he
realizes that the time has come for them to confront Duval. Marta has no
idea how, but Enrique has a plan. As he explains it to her, telling her
that she must not exchange the brooch for a crucifix, they do not realize
that Duval is listening.But first the show must go on. While Marta dances, Enrique searches
the theater for signs of Duval. Following a jungle dance, Marta is lifted
off the stage by a swing made of vines. When she nears the top of the
scaffolding, Barraza is waiting for her. Marta fights him off, but a raise
of Duval's hand places her in trance. As Duval carries Marta down many
flights of metal stairs to where the Teatro links with the Museo, Barraza
knocks out Enrique and follows his master, but Enrique recovers quickly
and pursues. Duval carries Marta down into the Museo basement where he
lays her on top his coffin. He lights some candles and places a ring on
Marta's hand in preparation for making her his bride as Enrique and
Barraza play cat and mouse upstairs among the wax figures. In their
struggle, Barraza attempts to trap Enrique in the iron maiden, but he
escapes.In the basement, Duval is about to bite Marta for the second time
when she suddenly comes out of the trance, screams, and races up the
stairs and out into the Museo proper. Enrique pounces on Duval, and
accidentally pushes Marta onto the rack of the guillotine, her neck
fitting nicely in the slicer. Duval uses all his vampire tricks, such as
disappearing and changing into a bat, but Enrique finally gets him by
throwing a spear, which impales the bat against the wall, where he turns
back into Duval. Marta comes out of her trance and sits up ... just in
time. She has no sooner lifted her head from the guillotine when the blade
falls.The police come barreling down the stairs and catch Barraza, but it's
all over except for the final kiss. [Original synopsis by bj_kuehl]"
