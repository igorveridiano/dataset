She tells off her son Peter ""Pete"" Miller (Keith Gordon) because he doesn't want to go to the museum with her: he prefers to stay home working on an improved computer which can count binary numbers up to 20 digits. It looks like Kate's partner Mike (Fred Weber) is not Pete's father.Kate leaves home to see her psychiatrist Doctor Robert Elliott (Michael Caine) who has to perform the duties of receptionist as Mary is on a holiday. Kate complains about the ""surprise"" visit of her mother from Florida due to her approaching birthday. She also complains about Mike's ""specialties"". She is fed up with her husband and mother but she doesn't say anything to the right person. Elliott tells her not to get angry with him but with Mike and tell him that he's bad in bed. She questions Elliott whether he finds her attractive or not. He admits that he finds her attractive but he also says that he's married and doesn't want to put his marriage in danger. Kate says she isn't sure whether putting his own marriage with Mike at risk would be worthwhile.Later Kate is at the museum. A man sits next to her. She leaves a glove for him. They follow each other around the museum. She loses his sight so she has an expression which says ""obviously he wasn't serious about me"" but when he turns around he's there staring at him. She seems to panick for a second and then is happy that he's not there. But he appears again on her back touching her with her own glove. When she realises she's lost it she tries to find it and then she realises he's got it. Music in innuendo while she tries to find him. When she leaves the museum she sees his hand showing the glove from a yellow cab. She smiles and tells him politely ""thank you for retrieving my missing glove"" but he pulls her inside. They make love while the taxi driver (Sean O'Rinn) looks at them through the inside mirror. She has a noisy orgasm.They arrive to his destination his apartment. She stays with him through the afternoon. When she is about to leave she finds papers stating that he's suffering from a sexually-transmitted disease and that she will have probably caught it. She leaves. When she is in the lift she is so nervous that she caresses her hands one against the other. Then she realises that she's forgotten her wedding ring in the apartment of the man. She has to go to the flat again but when she gets to the right floor another blond woman - probably using a wig - with dark sunglasses stabs her with a straight razor. Kate is left for dead all bloodied. Another couple of people has called the lift: they are discussing the convenience of buying the shares of a particular company. He runs away but Elizabeth ""Liz"" Blake (Nancy Allen) stares at him. When she looks inside the lift Kate is still alive. They try to reach out for each other's hand while the doors of the lift are slowly closing down. In the last second Liz stares up and in the reflection of the mirror she sees the blonde-wigged woman who is about to cut her hand as well. She backs up. A cleaning lady (Amalie Collier) appears and she shouts when she looks at Liz with the razor menacingly held by her hand.Elliott finds an answering machine left for a man (William Finlay) saying that there is a woman trying to het out of his body. He's worried because the man has also admitted to stealing a straight razor from the cabinet of his office.Detective Marino (Dennis Franz) questions Elliott who gets very defensive but doesn't mention the answering machine message. Meanwhile Liz is waiting to be questioned as well and Pete is listening to the whole conversation. Marino mentions that the man Warren Lockman (Ken Baker) was recognised by the taxi driver. Mike picks Pete up.Marino questions Liz about what she was doing in the building. She says she was with a married man. She is a prostitute. Marino suspects of her: nobody saw the blonde woman and her fingerprints are on the weapon. The man Ted (Norman Evans) is from out of the city and Marino tells Liz that she is the only interested person in finding Ted.When Liz leaves Pete is also stuck with a man he doesn't love at all - his true father died during the 'Nam war. He tries to investigate the case as well. In his blue moped he follows Liz all over the city. He arranges a camera to be hidden inside the box at the back of the bike. While he watches Liz the mysterious man has phoned Elliott again threatening her. Liz tries to stay home but she needs the money to invest in the company which Ted had recommended so she asks for 500 dollars to meet a client Cleveland Sam (Brandon Maggart) in the room 331. She leaves a bit distraught. She jumps onto a taxi but realises that somebody is following her. She asks the young taxi driver (Bill Randolph) to lose the follower. The taxi driver wants to meet her for dinner. The taxi driver tries to help Liz: she opens the door of the taxi when the blonde lady is following Liz. Liz runs to the underground but when she tries to leave another blonde transsexual or travesty scares her off. Liz approaches some black men (Robert Lee Rush Anthony Boyd Scriven Robert McDuffie and Frederick Sanders) who are listening to the radio but one of them called Sonny threatens her as the train arrives.Liz tells the police officer (Samm-Art Williams) who ends up thinking she is making it all up because he can't see any gang threatening to ""cut her up"" and Liz's claims that a blonde is following her leave the officer even more convinced that she's mad. In the next station the police officer leaves. When the doors close the gang appears again just causing a nuisance to all passengers. Liz runs from them and closes one door behind. At that moment the blonde woman puts a hand on her mouth and wants to slash her with another straight razor. Fortunately Pete saves Liz using an anti-rape spray of his invention. Liz invites him over. Pete sleeps at Liz's and she promises that he won't tell anyone that he's not studying French with at his friend Paul's. Liz tells him that she knows that the blonde woman left the doctor's office but she can't explain how she knows it. As Marino can't get a register order like that he suggests her to enter Elliott's office and check the doctor's agenda.Dr. Levy (David Margulies) tells Elliott that one of her patients Bobby / Bobbi (William Finlay) has stopped seeing him because he didn't approve of his sex change. Elliott tells Levy that Bobbi must be the murderer of the lady in the lift and they also comment on the missing razor. Later Liz pretends to be a new patient of dr Elliott. She tells him about an erotic dream of her but also admits that she's a prostitute although she sometimes makes love to men for pleasure. She gets naked trying to seduce him. During all this time Pete is watching with some lens. Liz checks the address book of dr Elliott and she thinks that the name she's looking for is Chris Clemens. Pete tries to to tell her that the blonde woman is inside the office - he's seen it - but a blonde woman has attacked him so when he finally can cry out to Liz the blonde woman is already prepared to slash her with a Straight Razor.At that moment the blonde woman who is holding Pete down shoots Bobbi.The wig falls off. The blonde woman is a wounded man. It's the doctor Robert Elliott.Some time later Levy Marino Pete and Liz are sitting down. Levy explains that Elliott had a double personality: he was the masculine doctor but he was also a patient who wanted to have a sex change performed and giving Bobbi as his name he visited doctor Levy. Levy says that Elliott represent Bobbi but that when Bobbi decided to go for the sex change surgery that pushed him to act. Levy said that every time that doctor Elliott felt attracted by a woman her alter-ego killed that woman. The blonde woman who attacked Pete was police officer Betty Luke (Susanna Clemm) who was in charge of following Liz. Marino pushed her to enter dr Elliott's address book because he didn't have any proofs against him.Liz explains to Pete how a sex change operation takes place. He replies sitting confortably at a restaurant with her that he may change the subject of his investigation and use himself as the subject of that sex change instead of investigating about computers.Meanwhile back at a madhouse a nurse (Anneka di Lorenzo) walks in to give Dr Elliott the medicine he must take. He looks defenseless and sleepy but he jumps and strangles her. All the loose madmen cheer. Pete invites her to sleep at his home saying that his step-father won't mind.Naked in the shower Liz feels some danger. Somebody dressed as a nurse approaches and she knows it. She doesn't have anything to defend herself in the bathroom except for something in the medicine cabinet. However suddenly the razor is at Liz's neck. The same blonde woman cuts Liz's neck.Terrified Liz wakes up in a bedroom at Pete's. He tries to calm her down.FADE TO BLACK"

"After attending her grandmother's funeral in Dallas Texas Lisa Reisert (Rachel McAdams) who has a fear of flying takes a red-eye flight to Miami Florida.While in the check-in line she meets an older lady (Angela Paton) who is interested in Lisa's Dr. Phil book. She tells her she's a fan so Lisa gives the woman her book saying she has already read it.Lisa also meets Jackson Rippner (Cillian Murphy) a man whom she initially finds charming. After their flight is delayed due to weather Lisa meets with Jackson again in the bar and they talk to each other while having a drink. When boarding Lisa is pleasantly surprised to find that Jackson is seated beside her. She's even more impressed when Rippner calms down a rude passenger (Loren Lester) who was giving a hard time to the airline attendant (Mary-Kathleen Gordon).After take off Lisa is shocked when Jackson transitions into something she never expected revealing to her that he is a terrorist operative working for a group who intends to assassinate the United States Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Charles Keefe (Jack Scalia) and his family. He tells Lisa that she is instrumental in their plans because of her job as Acting Manager at the Lux Atlantic Hotel where the Keefe family will be staying. If she refuses to cooperate Rippner will deploy a hit man to kill her father Joe (Brian Cox) at his home in Miami.Lisa's task is to use the in-flight phone to call her assistant at the hotel and tell her to change the room that the Keefe's will be staying in even though they always stay in the same room and any room they use has to be pre-cleared by the Secret Service. Lisa tries to convince Rippner that she doesn't have that authority but he knows better and orders her to make the call and order the hotel staff to change the reservation from the inner room 3825 to suite 4080 which faces the harbor.When Lisa first places a call to the hotel answered by her co-worker Cynthia (Jayma Mays) the line goes dead midway through the conversation and Lisa tries (unsuccessfully) to fool Rippner into thinking she is ordering the room change as directed but then Rippner notices a nearby passenger trying to make a call and looking with frustration at his phone. There's a message on the screen on the back of the phone which says ""service temporarily unavailable."" Rippner grabs the phone away from Lisa and confirms it's dead. He's not happy.Lisa attempts to find a way to keep both her father and Keefe safe. Her first attempt is when the older lady from the check-in line comes to talk to her about the Dr. Phil book (Rippner had been asked by the flight attendant to help with positioning some luggage in the overhead). The woman asks Lisa to write some things in the book. Lisa tries to write a warning in the book but Rippner is ever vigilant and realizes what she was doing. When he returns to his seat he head butts her unconscious and puts a pillow under her head to make it appear she is simply sleeping. He then manages to steal the book back from the older woman before she is able to see the message.Lisa tries again by going into the restroom and writing a warning on the mirror with hand soap that there's a bomb where Rippner is sitting. As she opens the door to leave the restroom Rippner is standing there. He sees the message on the mirror and pushes Lisa back into the restroom and shuts the door. He slams her around and chokes her then wipes the message off. He warns her again not to gamble with her father's life. Rippner notices a scar above Lisa's breast and asks her about that but she refuses to answer.A small girl who was waiting to use the restroom tells the flight attendant that two people were in the restroom. The flight attendant assumes the couple are in the process of becoming members of the Mile High Club so she doesn't intervene but the little girl is savvy enough to realize that things aren't that way between the man and woman in the restroom. Nevertheless she remains quiet about it during the rest of the flight.When Lisa and Jackson return to their seats Lisa makes the phone call to Cynthia and Cynthia meets the Keefes and their Secret Service escorts in the lobby and informs them of the need to change the room due to a plumbing problem. When Keefe learns it was Lisa who ordered the change he tells the Secret Service to go ahead and clear the new room.Lisa wants Rippner to call his hit man and order him to stand down now that she'd done her part but Rippner says he still needs her as he can't let her and her father go until he gets a phone call confirming that Keefe has been successfully dealt with. When she expresses concern that the hit man might get impatient and act before being called off Jackson reassures her that he'll only act on Jackson's orders saying that ""he's a good dog who only responds to the sound of his master's voice."" Lisa soon realizes that not only Keefe to be killed but his family too and she's even more distressed.The Secret Service do a thorough sweep of the new room and even contact the Coast Guard to go investigate a fishing boat sitting way out in the harbor. When the Coast Guard boards and inspects the boat they call in that it's all clear. The hotel staff then move Keefe and his family into the new suite.As the plane is landing in Miami Lisa confides in Rippner telling him that the scar on her throat was from a knife held to her throat by a rapist two years ago. When Rippner observes that there was nothing she could do about it she disagrees and tells him she swore that she would never let it happen again. She then jerks her right hand and arm up and around and stabs Rippner in the throat with an ink pen she stole earlier from a young male passenger.The pen punctures Rippner's windpipe and damages his vocal chords. Lisa climbs over him and as she goes by she takes his phone and scrambles to make her way through the aisle and other passengers to the main exit door. A young male passenger who'd been falsely accused by his friend of taking his ink pen wryly observes that now they know what happened to his pen.Lisa has to wait until the door is open giving time for Rippner to gather himself pull the pen from his throat wrap a scarf around his neck and start after her. Rippner is slowed a bit more when the little girl who'd been observing him during the flight shoves her little carryon bag out into the aisle tripping him and knocking him down.The men on that fishing boat that had been cleared by the Coast Guard are shown hauling in a fishing line. On the other end of the line is a large container which they load onboard and open revealing the component parts to an FGM-148 Javelin man-portable fire-and-forget anti-tank missile. They begin assembling the weapon.Lisa flees the plane removing her thin sweater and tossing it into the trash as security had already been alerted. She narrowly escapes Rippner and airport security. Once outside she steals an SUV from a driver who was greeting an arriving passenger.Lisa makes a call with Rippner's phone noting that it has a low-battery warning so she's worried about that. However she is able to get through to Cynthia at the hotel telling her what's going on then ordering her to pull the fire alarm and make sure to get the Keefe's out of their suite immediately. Cynthia is freaking out but she does exactly what Lisa told her to do.The Secret Service get the Secretary and his family out of the room just seconds before the Javelin missile is fired. It races across the sky and plows into the suite exploding and destroying the room and everything in the immediate vicinity. Cynthia the Keefes and the Secret Service agents all managed to escape the room seconds before. The men on the fishing boat toss their weapon overboard and take off.Lisa still driving tries to call her father but the cell phone's battery dies just as he picks up the phone and says hello. She rushes to her father's house arriving to find the hit man (Dane Farwell) standing just outside the front door. He hears Lisa approach and turns to face her reaching inside his jacket. Lisa turns the SUV and floors the accelerator jumping the curb and slamming into the hit man driving him through the front door killing him.Lisa finds her father inside. He is shocked not only by a vehicle slamming into his front door but seeing a man lying on the entryway and then his daughter walking in. He tells Lisa that he has already called 911.Lisa calls the hotel to check on things there. Cynthia confirms the Keefes are ok. When Lisa turns around after talking with Cynthia Rippner is standing there. He'd knocked out her father Joe who was lying on the kitchen floor. Lisa hurried to the kitchen to make sure her father was alive then she turns her attention to Rippner. She's really angry now telling him that he'd failed at his mission and assuring him that he's not about to defeat her in her own house.Over the course of the next few minutes she has the upper hand as she throws things punches and kicks him as he chases her through the house. He eventually returns to the body of the hit man and grabs the 12"" K-Bar knife the man was going to kill Joe with.Lisa manages to make another phone call to 911 as she sneaks around trying to figure out where Rippner had disappeared to. As she closes a bedroom door intending to lock herself in he is standing right there. They fight some more and she clubs him with a stout cane she'd found in the closet knocking the knife away. He ends up throwing her down a flight of stairs. Lisa crawls down the last few steps where she sees a gun lying next to the dead hit man. She grabs the gun and turns to threaten Jackson with it. He moves towards her anyway and she shoots him wounding him. He kicks the gun out of her hand and grabs her by the hair. He's about to kill her when Joe appears and shouts ""hey!"" As Rippner pauses and looks up Joe shoots him in the chest.Lisa returns to the hotel where she greets and hugs a very frazzled Cynthia. Cynthia observes that she thought things went pretty well overall during Lisa's absence other than the most recent event. The Homeland Secretary expresses his gratitude to Lisa and Cynthia before he's ushered off.An older man and woman who'd been guests at the hotel that day come up to Lisa and Cynthia complaining about their terrible stay with all the inconvenience and discomfort associated with the attempted assassination wanting to know what Lisa was going to do about it. When Lisa asks them what they think should be done they say first they wanted Cynthia fired. Lisa thinks for a moment then suggests to the couple that they fill out a comment card. They are aghast at that but then they are totally speechless when Lisa tells them that after they are done with that to just go ahead and ""shove it up your ass.""The movie ends with Lisa taking Cynthia out for a drink; 'anything but a bay breeze' the kind of drink Lisa had mentioned drinking to Jackson.

"Joe Turner (Robert Redford) is an employee of the CIA. He's not a secret agent his job is to read and he and his co-workers at the American Literary Historical Society read everything; books comics magazines and they scan everything into a database to be cross-checked against real CIA operations. On a rainy December morning it's business as usual so no one notices the non-descript man sitting in plain sedan across the street from Joe's building checking off names of every employee as they enter.Inside Joe looks for an answer to a letter he'd sent to the main CIA office at Langley. He has a theory about connections he's noticed between operations in Venezuela Saudi Arabia and other locations around the world but so far there's no response. Noon approaches and it's his turn to go out for lunch. Since it's still raining he ducks out the basement door (which is against regulations) and cuts through several back alleys to the deli. Meanwhile the sedan out front quietly pulls away after signaling to 3 men (one is a mailman) waiting in the street. They move in with quiet determination and knock on the front door. The mailman stands in view of the camera while the other two wait behind him.At the deli around the block Joe picks up lunch for the others and then runs back. Since the rain has stopped he goes to the front door and buzzes the security intercom to be let in but gets no answer. Pushing on the door he finds it is unlocked which it never is. Inside he finds a scene of carnage. Everyone has been murdered shot to death in the few minutes he has been gone. Fighting down his shock and horror he grabs a pistol from the receptionist's desk and flees.Suddenly everyone on the street looks suspicious and Joe realizes that whoever killed his coworkers is probably still looking for him. He finds a payphone and calls an emergency contact number at the CIA. ""This is...uh...'Condor'"" Joe says fighting through the shock to remember his code name. ""The section's been hit. Everyone's dead."" Told not to panic and to call back in two hours a CIA response team quickly arrives and verifies Joe's story. Higgens (Cliff Robertson) the section chief in New York wonders why in the world someone would take out a research office like this and calls his supervisor at CIA headquarters.Joe calls back and is told to stay alive 1 more hour. One of the other workers had called in sick so Joe goes to his apartment. He finds the co-worker in bed shot to death just before two men show up. Joe returns to his apartment building and is about to go in when a neighbor sweeping the sidewalk tells him that him that the two friends that he was expecting are waiting for him upstairs. Joe takes off without a word.When Joe calls the CIA back he's to meet his dept. head in a specified back alley off 72nd street where he'll be picked up and brought in safely. Very skittish over the murder and close calls Joe hesitates because he's never met his section chief (Wicks) or Director Higgins. They see in Joe's file that a college friend Sam Barber is a CIA accountant. Joe agrees to the meet if Sam is there. When Joe enters the alley only Sam is visible. Suddenly Wicks darts into view and shots ring out. His own department head is trying to kill him. Joe fires back and wounds Wicks and then runs away in a panic. Wicks is seriously injured but steadies himself long enough to shoot Sam in the throat. Convinced he can trust no one in desperation he kidnaps a woman on the street as she gets into her truck. Kathy (Faye Dunaway) is terrified but drives Turner to her apartment. Terrified himself he holds the gun on her as he tries to figure out what to do next.Gradually Kathy begins to realize that Turner is in real trouble and doesn't want to hurt her but she still doesn't believe his story. When 6pm rolls around he turns on the evening news only to find that they are calling the incident in the alley an attempted robbery in which only Wicks was shot. There is no mention of Sam. Still unsure of Kathy's loyalty he ties her up and sneaks over to Sam's apartment in her car. Sam's wife Mae (a former lover from college) has prepared dinner and drinks as if she and Sam were expecting him. When pressed she reveals that the office (CIA) had called AFTER Sam met Joe in the alley to say he would be running late. Joe realizes that this is a trap and hustles Mae upstairs to the neighbors.Realizing the assassin is hard on his tail he tries to get out of the building alive and when he gets on the elevator Joe finds himself next to a quiet man in a trenchcoat. This is Joubert (Max Von Sydow) a freelance assassin from Europe. (As we will learn his hobbies include fine wine classical music and painting military miniatures from perhaps the Napoleonic Era.) Some inner sense tells Joe that this fellow is part of the problem and Joe lags behind as Joubert walks out through the lobby. Convincing a group of loitering youth to walk out with him and screen him he makes it back to Kathy's Bronco as the trenchcoated man waits nearby holding a sniper rifle seeking Joe in the crowd. Unable to get a clear shot Joubert runs after the truck and uses his scope to get the vehicle's license plate number.Joe returns to Kathy's apartment just as her boyfriend is calling. Joe lets Kathy talk to the boyfriend who is angry at first that she's not on her way their rendezvous. Kathy is on-the-edge but manages to hold up her end of the conversation. They hang up. Joe begins to feel guilty and tells her that he'll leave in the morning. They discuss her work (photography) and Joe pieces her life from his observations. Joe says he just wants to ""make it all stop"" for a few hours - the horror. They connect. They spent the night together.The next morning Kathy is in the shower when THE Mailman (the guy who rang the bell at the building the day before) knocks at the door. Joe has been traced here via Joubert's writing down of the license plate the night before. The Mailman/hitman has a package for Kathy that must be signed for. Joe doesn't want to open the door but the Mailman has a well-rehearsed reply for every one of Joe's objections. (Joe yells through the window ""She's not home!"" Mailman: ""That's OK YOU can sign for it."" etc.) Joe opens the door but the Mailman's pen doesn't work (again a rehearsed device to enable the Mailman to get inside and shut the door). As Joe goes looking for a pen he glances back at the Mailman's shoes. Suddenly a stunned Joe realizes the Mailman is a hitman. He knows this because of the distinctive style of shoes he wears - one more thing Joe picked up in his voluminous reading. Thinking fast he hurls hot coffee at the Mailman just as the nasty guy begins firing with a suppressor-equipped machine gun. The machine gun ends up on the floor. Joe's .45 is out of reach. A fight ensues - the Mailman is a martial arts expert with a nasty kick; Joe wields a fireplace poker and knows this man is a trained killer. Kathy emerges from her shower to find them fighting provides a crucial bit of help to Joe and retreats. The fight continues. Kathy's photo equipment plays a pivotal role. The fight concludes with Joe retrieving the .45 in the nick of time firing two shots and killing the Mailman/hitman. Kathy emerges to find her living room messed up and Joe sitting next to the dead mailman. She needless to say is terribly upset. Joe tries to console her. Joe searches the hit man and finds a couple of vital pieces of information including a hotel key (mentioned below). Joe and Kathy must now flee because the bad guys know where he is.Despite his fear Joe has the beginnings of a plan and Kathy agrees to help. They visit the NYC office of the CIA and Kathy pretends to apply for a job then gets ""lost"" while she looks for Joe's section chief Higgins. Once spotted she helps Joe kidnap him while he eats lunch and Higgins is hustled into the back of Kathy's Bronco. Interrogated by Turner he confesses that he doesn't know what's going on any more that they do. ""This is obviously an inside operation"" he says and it doesn't help that Wicks died mysteriously in the hospital. Joe confronts Higgins with the Mailman's ID and that he had a phone number that rang an office in CIA-Langley. Higgins begins to suspect that the lead assassin is Joubert a former CIA assassin that now does contract work. Back at the office Higgins does a search and finds information linking Joubert and the Mailman as partners in past CIA hits.Joe manages to put the pieces together by tracking down Joubert the quiet man in the trenchcoat. Joe found a hotel key on the Mailman and finds Joubert in the same hotel. Tapping into the phone exchange in Joubert's hotel he monitors the calls and places an anonymous one himself to Joubert. ""Do you believe the Condor is an endangered species?"" he asks and hangs up. Joubert quickly calls his controller and Joe is able to track the call to a man named Atwood a high-level supervisor in the CIA. From a telco trunk he crosswires 50 phones to block a trace and calls to tell Higgins that he's found Joubert and asks who Atwood is. Higgins doesn't answer and Joe hangs up. One of Higgins supervisors is listening close by and tells him ""this"" needs to be ended NOW. As he prepares to confront Atwood Joe thanks Kathy for all her help and they reluctantly part company.At Atwood's country home the stereo suddenly comes on in the middle of the night and when he investigates the noise in his study Atwood finds Turner sitting quietly in a chair holding a gun. Forced to confess Atwood tells Joe that the hit on the section was due to that paper he'd sent to CIA headquarters. Joe demands to know why so many people had to die over some nothing book that suddenly became popular in the Middle East Netherlands (Dutch) Mexico Venezu......ohhhhh....OIL! Atwood is involved in a scheme to manipulate the world's oil markets and Turner's paper had hit too close to the truth. He and anyone else who might know about it had to be eliminated. Furious Joe points the gun at Atwood.""Drop the gun"" says a quiet voice; It's Joubert standing quietly behind him. Realizing his defeat Joe drops the pistol on the floor and waits for the inevitable thinking that at least now he knows why all this has happened. Joubert still holding his gun on Joe takes a position next to Atwood and like a cobra strike turns and shoots Atwood in the right temple! As Joe stutters Joubert places his gun in Atwood's hand and calmly begins to wipe down the room asking what he had touched. Joe realizes that Joubert had a new contract to take out Atwood. Joubert confirms ""Atwood had become an embarrassment"" and that the contract that Atwood put on Condor has died with him.After leading him outside the house and handing back his pistol. ""Can I drop you somewhere?"" he asks in a friendly tone. Joe agrees to be taken back to New York. As they leave Joubert advises that his life will never be the same again and there is no guarantee that ""someone"" won't decide that he's a liability in the future. He even describes how IT might happen and offers that Europe is not a bad place to live. Impressed by how he handled the situation Joubert suggests that he strongly consider a future as an assassin.With a new lease on life Joe still has a few loose ends to tie up. Returning to New York Joe waits for Higgins to walk past on the street and they have a tense final confrontation. Higgins explains that the CIA does business this way because they need to. There is no other way. Turner disagrees and as they stop in front of a distribution center of the New York Times Turner tells Higgins that they've become too used to killing people as part of their job. He's told a reporter everything.""Ah you fool"" sighs Higgins. ""You've done more harm than you know."" As Turner walks away Higgins calls after him. ""It didn't have to end this way Condor. You're about to become a very lonely man."" Joe seems not to care. He believes he's had his revenge on the CIA and he fades away into the crowd as a Salvation Army Band plays Christmas music. But the haunting last words of Higgins linger in the air: ""How do you know they'll publish? How do you know???"""

Joe Turner code name Condor works as a reader for Section 17 - fronting as the American Literacy Historical Society - of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The section's readers read everything that is published to see if the material is being used or planted by national security agencies for the US or enemy regimes in actual operations. The office for the section which is comprised of eight people in total is located in a nondescript but secure building in New York City. After returning to the office from a lunch food run for which he initially left the building through an unofficial entrance/exit Condor finds that all six of his colleagues at work that day including his girlfriend Janice Chon have been executed their dead bodies strewn throughout the office. The seventh has been murdered in his home. Not knowing any of his superiors outside the section Condor slowly begins not to trust the organization itself. After a botched attempt to bring him in Condor decides to go on the run and try and figure out what is happening on his own. In his quest Condor kidnaps a young seemingly lonely woman named Kathy Hale who despite being scared by what is happening eventually believes Condor's story and decides to help him.

"Cast members of a show at the Alden theatre are being terrorized by a hunchback killer known as the Fiend using frozen bullets and two have been killed. Newspaper reporters Jean Monroe drama editor and Frank Gordon accompanied by a dumb photographer Elmer are on the story. Jean receives a note from Ted Wallington the star of the play""Satan's Bride"" to meet him. From him she learns the note was a fake the lights go out and the Fiend strikes again as Wallington slumps to the floor dead. Peter Fortune the author of the show who has helped the police solve previous cases agrees to assist on this case but insists on working alone. Jean and Frank have taken rooms at the Globe Hotel where Reardon an actor is also a resident. A telephone message for Frank turns out to be a ruse in the hopes of getting him out of the hotel. Reardon suggests calling the police but while phoning his finger is holding the receiver hook down. Meanwhile Elmer calls Frank and the reporter is dumbfounded to hear his phone ring while Reardon is apparently talking to Police Captain Davis. A fight ensues and Reardon escapes. This gives the hunchbacked terror a chance to slip in the room to make another attempt on Jean's life but the shot misses. Fortune has some pictures of Reardon donning the Fiend's flowing robe and Reardon is taken into custody. During an re-enactment of the Wallington murder Reardon is killed and another theory is exploded. Frank discovers a cigarette case belonging to Fortune and his investigation reveals the Fortune's brother had been killed in a fire in a theatre owned by Cooke and Baker the producers of the show.::Les Adams <longhorn1939@suddenlink.net>"
"Someone... or something... is killing the monks at the abbey in Whitechapel and Sherlock Holmes [Matt Frewer] and Dr Watson [Kenneth Welsh] have been called to investigate. Rumor is that it's the work of a vampire brought back from a recent mission in Guiana. In all cases the victims have been found with two large puncture wounds on their necks. On the wall written in blood is usually a message like ""As you have sinned against me so shall I exact my revenge.""Brother Marstoke [Shawn Larence] believes that the killings might be retribution from Desmodo a fiercesome demon from South America who usually appears as a giant vampire bat. He explains that while in Guiana he had a falling out with Dr Chagas over the killing of a colony of bats which Marstoke was led to believe carried a plague. Hector de la Rosa [Danny Blanco Hall] actually saw the killer and confirms that it had the face of Desmodo just as depicted in a statue of Desmodo in Marstoke's collection of South American gods and demons that he brought back from Guiana.The next morning Holmes and Watson go right to work. The first thing they do is speak with Sra de la Rosa [Isabel Dos Santos]  who was the one to discover the first body. When they mention the name of Dr Chagas Sra de la Rosa tightens in fear. She considers Chagas a 'vampiro' because of his work with vampire bats. As Sra de la Rosa in a whispered voice tells Holmes about Chagas the ground suddenly starts to tremble. An omen?Next is to investigate the church premises. Holmes checks out the crypt. Nothing there except for a colony of bats hanging from the ceiling. Upon these discoveries and the knowledge that the abbey doors were locked at the time of the killings Holmes deduces that the killer may be in the abbey itself. That evening he calls a meeting of all the brothers and sisters and asks for the names of those who were on the Guiana mission (Marstoke Brother Caulder Brother Sinclair (one of the first to die) Brother John Brother Abel Sister Helen and Sister Margaret) as the killings began just after their return. Holmes wonders whether or not there is some connection. He also advises everyone whether or not they were on the mission to be extremely careful and to never go anywhere alone.Unfortunately Abel [Tom Rack] has been left alone to sleep as he has been ill since returning from Guiana. Holmes Watson and Marstoke rush to Abel's bedroom where they find Hector comforting a terrified Abel who says that he was awakened by a big dark thing that tried to bite him but flew out the window when he screamed. Watson looks out the window but it is too dark to see anything.Next on the list of investigations is for Watson to get an analysis of the blood used in the writing on the wall while Holmes talks with ""vampiro"" Chagas who has taken lodging at 4 Renfield Place in Whitechapel. It turns out that Chagas [Neville Edwards] is a naturalist who studies bats. He calls them his ""children"" which caused many in Guiana to think of him as a ""vampiro"". Even the Whitechapel locals think Chagas is the vampire
since he is known to roam the streets at night. Indeed only a few minutes after speaking with Chagas Holmes observes him leaving his flat.It is now 9:15 pm and Sr Helen [Cary Lawrence] and Bro John [Matthew Tiffin] are leaving one of their charities to return to the abbey when Helen (who is blind) hears moaning in an alley. John goes to help and is attacked by Desmodo. Desmodo then turns on Helen but she is saved when someone enters the alley and chases away her attacker. Unfortunately John is dead with two holes in his neck.The next morning Holmes goes to investigate the alley where the killing took place. When Holmes finds out that Inspector Jones has arrested Chagas as the killer on the basis that he was seen leaving his flat last night just before the killing and he returned with blood on his gloves Holmes poopoohs the idea since he was with Chagas until shortly after 9 after which he observed Chagas leaving several minutes later and going north to Whitecastle Road. Since the killing took place on Demeter Street in the opposite direction no one could backtrack and cover that distance in 10 minutes... unless he could fly. Jones isn't convinced but does agree to have the blood analyzed. Just then Jones discovers that Chagas has escaped through an open window.Holmes and Watson go to investigate Bro John's body. Watson notices something peculiar about the two holes on his neck... there are no marks from the lower teeth. Either the wounds were made by someone missing a lower mandible he deduces or they were made by some other means.Next is to interview Sr Helen but first they stop to see how Abel is faring after the fright he received last night. He's quite well and is working on a model of the hermitage and has no further information to offer. Meanwhile Marstoke is praying in the church when the ground starts to shake again. An earthquake? And Sr Helen doesn't have any idea how anyone in the abbey might have sinned against anyone else either gods or humans. All she can remember about her attack is hearing a groaning and a sound like something scraping and then smelling a slightly pungent oily odor as the killer approached her.Now to interview Brother Caulder [Joel Miller] but he has gone to visit his sister the psychic known as Madame Karavsky [Kathleen Fee]. She is attempting to get
insights about the killings from objects her brother has brought her. Holmes puts no stock in her insights but he does learn that Caulder considers Chagas to be the devil's disciple and sees Marstoke's collection of artifacts as sacrilegious. Caulder also tells Holmes that it was Brother Abel who pinpointed the bats as the source of the plague and
insisted on their irradication a contradiction of what Marstoke told Holmes... that it was he (Marstoke) who had insisted on irradicating the bats.On his way back to the abbey Holmes is pushed into the path of trotting horses but manages to roll away just in time to see a black-cloaked figure running away. Shortly thereafter Watson who is walking around the church sees a hooded figure sneak in through the crypt door. Watson follows and comes upon Caulder just returning from his
sister's house. Watson inquires as to whether he always uses the crypt door but Caulder claims that he came in through the front door an alibi that Hector confirms.So many suspects so little evidence but Holmes is beginning to see a thread. Still a little verification is in order. First a visit to Abel who is putting the finishing paint to his model. Then a visit to Chagas... but not to his flat rather to an old house where he nurtures his colony of endangered bats. Just as Holmes says he can clear Chagas' name however Inspector Jones raids the house and arrests them both.Back at the abbey Watson gets a note from Holmes regarding his arrest and the fact that he can do no more while he is incarcerated. Marstoke decides that the only thing left is to leave the abbey in hopes of taking the curse with him. He intends to spend the night in prayer and leave the next morning. As Marstoke prays Desmodo attacks him. What ho! It is not Marstoke praying; it is Holmes. Just as Inspector Jones shows up guns drawn the ground begins to tremble again and a large statue falls on Desmodo killing him. Holmes removes the Desmodo mask to reveal Brother Abel. He is also wearing a glove with a garden claw in the palm which Holmes names as the implement used to puncture the necks of his victims.In the epilogue Watson explains that the earthquake that saved Holmes was actually a subsidence due to an extension of the Underground which is being constructed right under the abbey. Holmes tells how when Inspector Jones learned that the blood on Chagas' glove was bat blood not human blood he agreed to help Holmes in his little deception. With regards to whether Chagas argued with Marstoke or Abel regarding the
irradication of the bats Chagas says that it was both. First Abel insisted on their irradication. Marstoke took up the argument only after Abel was stricken with the plague.How did Holmes know it was Abel? Holmes explains that he saw Abel drinking tea with his left hand and because the writing on the wall slanted to the left Abel became the prime suspect. Also the pungent oily smell that Sr Helen smelled was confirmed as the same odor as the paint Abel was using for his model. Finally the sight of a gardener with
a two-pronged garden tool confirmed Holmes' suspicion that a metal implement made the scratching that Sr Helen heard and was also used to make the holes in his victims' necks. And thus the Whitechapel vampire was laid to rest.[Original synopsis by bj_kuehl]

Sherlock Holmes investigates a series of death rumoured to be caused by a vampire.::Kenneth Chisholm
Dover England October 12 1959 11:45 AM. A distraught young woman (Elizabeth Turner) drives to a scenic cliff-top overlooking the English Channel and throws herself off. At exactly the same time in Florence Italy the woman's young daughter Virginia (Fausta Avelli) has a vision of her mother's gruesome fall.Italy 1976. A grown-up Virginia Ducci (Jennifer O'Neill) happily bids farewell to her new husband Francesco (Gianni Garko) as he leaves their house for a business trip abroad. After dropping him off at a small airport and driving home Virginia experiences a number of confusing fragmented visions while driving through dark road tunnel; a broken mirror in a dimly lit room; a lamp; a yellow cigarette burning in an ashtray; a magazine with a young woman on the front cover; a stuffed bird; the blood soaked corpse of an old lady; a fresco of The Madonna and Child; the footfalls of a man with a limp; a blinking red light; a yellow taxi; and someone being walled up in a dark hole.Virginia turns to her friend Dr Luca Fattori (Marc Porel) who has an interest in the paranormal and she describes to him what she has seen. Afterwards Virginia drives over to a rambling villa owned by her husband. The recently married couple intend to redecorate and move into the dusty building which Francesco hasn't used for four years. Alone Virginia experiences a mounting unease as she removes the drapes of the living room to discover items from her vision. Recalling a hole in the wall the finds traces of a plaster over recess and attacks with a pickaxe and uncovers skeletal human remains.The police are curious as to how Virginia found the body which was very well concealed. She describes her vision to them but they remain skeptic. The police maintain that the dead person was a young woman killed between January and June 1972 and she was only 25 years old when she died. Back at the villa that evening Virginia sees what she takes to be an apparision of the dead woman from her vision (Veronica Michielini) standing outside. When Virginia gives chase the old woman runs away into the dark. Francesco returns from his business trip where Virginia updates him on everything that has happened. He urges her to dismiss the matter from her mind but she instead grows more and more obsessed with learning this mystery.The police led by Commissioner D'Elia investigate further and they identify the entombed victim as Agneta Bignardi. Virginia recognizes her from a photograph; she's the girl on the cover of the magazine in Virginias vision. Francesco already a suspect can only provide an alibi for himself in half the possible murder period. After he admits that he did have an affair with Agenta back in 1972 he gets arrested.Virginia discusses the case with Francesco's sister Gloria (Evelyn Stewart) and Melli (Riccardo Parisio Perrotti) a lawyer friend of Glorias. Virginia notices that Gloria smokes distinctive yellow cigarettes which are a French brand called Gitanes identical to the one in her vision. Virginia accepts an extra pack from Virginia to smoke and the two women go to the old house to investigate. Gloria says that her brother left for a business trip to America in April 1972 and that she was the one who changed the furniture of the place. The room with the walled-in corpse had been Franceso's bedroom but was the Gloria whod bought the furniture that Virginia saw in her vision after Francesco's departure.Luca's secretary the resourceful Bruna (Jenny Tamburi) discovers that there were only 16 yellow taxies operating in Rome in 1972. Luca and Virgina make contact with a driver (Francesgo Angrisano) who remembers taking a girl in the police photo to a picture gallery and that her gentlemanly chaperone has a pronounced limp. At the gallery Virginia recognizes a Vermeer painting from her vision. The superintendent of the gallery Emilio Rospini (Gabriele Ferzetti) watches them as the leave. He is the man in Virginia's vision.A few days later Virginia buys a magazine which runs a picture of the murdered woman on the front cover the exact same magazine from Virginia's vision. When Luca notices that the magazine has only existed for a year it becomes apparent to him that Virginia has experienced a premontion not a vision of past crimes. Virginia and Luca find more evidence that appears to clear Francesco allowing him to get released on bail. Gloria in the meantime gives Virginia a watch one that plays a haunting tune on the hour.Details from the promotions start to occur in front of Virginia with greater and greater frequency. Virginia takes a yellow taxi with a blinking CB radio light from Luca's office to her home. The mysterious old woman calls Virginia leaving a message on her answering machine offering information about the case. When Virginia arrives at her house she finds her dead (in the same position from Virginia's vision). Rospini appears and Virginia flees in panic. Grabbing a vital letter featured on a coffee table in her vision Virginia escapes down the road to a neighboring church that is undergoing repairs. Virginias hiding place is given away when her wristwatch chimes go off. Rospini tries to reach her on a wooden scaffold but slips and falls to the marble floor many feet below.Virginia runs back to her husband's old villa nearby and phones him at his office to come see her right away. When he arrives Virginia is alarmed by his limp which he claims to have twisted his ankle just a few hours before. They go inside to the fateful room. Francesco puts down a copy of the magazine with Agneta on the cover right on the table as described in the vision. Growing more nervous Virginia starts smoking one of Glorias yellow cigarettes and places it in an ashtray also featured in the vision.At the hospital the police talk to the badly injured Rospini who can barely gasp out his explination of the events. Back in 1972 the old woman Signora Casati had an illicit buyer for a valuable painting in a nearby gallery. Francesco Rospini and Agneta Bignardi had all bee involved in stealing it. Rospini killed a guard a fact mentioned in a letter Agneta wrote to Casati. Rospini was not trying to kill Virginia but only trying to retrieve the letter. Casati was already dead when he arrived having been killed by Francesco who sustained a twisted ankle after jumping out of a window. It was Francesco who murdered Agneta all those years ago after she enraged him by trying to make off with the painting alone.Alone with her husband Virginia becomes more and more frightened by the gradual confluences of elements from her vision. The last crucial link in the chain occurs when Francesco sees the incriminating letter on the dresser. Virginia claims that she hasn't read it but he refuses to believe her. He suddenly attacks his wife with a fireplace poker. His first blow misses as she ducks and it smashes a mirror. The next blow strikes her dead on the head. As she lies on the floor bleeding profuesly he prepares to wall her into the excavated hole in the wall. Finally all the details of room fit with the vision: Virginia was foreseeing her own death.A little later Luca figures out from the magazine cover about the real location and time which Francesco could have murdered Agneta Bignardi. He then races over to the Ducci villa while being chased by two motorcycle cops who are trying to arrest him for speeding. He manages to keep their fingers off his collar long enough to elaborate his suspicions. Francesco invites them all into his house and into the room expressing concern at his wife's dissapearance. Despite a war of nerves Luca cannot break the sociopath Francesco's bland of self control. As Luca turns to leave escorted by the police everyone hears a haunting tune like a music box chime emerging from the wall....

"The story is set in the indeterminate future. A virus deliberately released in 1996 in multiple locations around the world has killed off nearly all of the Earth's population at least five billion people. Survivors have established an elaborate underground civilization because the earth's surface is considered uninhabitable by humans. Animals roam freely having re-inherited the surface. From time to time prisoners ""volunteer"" to don protective gear and gather specimens of insects from the surface to test for the presence of the virus.One such prisoner is James Cole who after retrieving samples is given the chance to go back in time to 1996 and find information about the group believed responsible known as ""The Army of 12 Monkeys."" Throughout the ensuing episodes Cole finds himself remembering as if he were dreaming various things that he witnessed as a child including the killing of a man in an airport a theme that persists through the story.Miscalculation sends Cole to 1990 and he finds himself incarcerated in an insane asylum after severely beating his arresting officers. His psychiatrist Kathryn Railly thinks she has met him before but his ravings are incoherent to her. Eventually Cole is sent to an insane asylum where he is locked up with other mental patients. When he stands for evaluation by the hospital's board including Railly he asks if he can make one telephone call a communication with the scientists of his time to retrieve him. The phone is answered by a random woman who has a bunch of crying children and knows nothing about any scientists.While he's in the asylum Cole meets Jeffrey Goines an off-the-wall patient who tries to help him escape handing him a key to the day room's barred gate. Cole is quickly recaptured and restrained in an isolation room. When Railly & her boss Dr Fletcher enter the room to check on Cole he has vanished snatched back to his present time by the scientists who sent him there. He is interrogated by the scientists and given a second chance to complete his mission after telling the scientists that he was sent to the wrong year institutionalized and drugged. A second miscalculation sends him to the battlefields of World War I where he is shot in the leg. As he crawls around the trenches naked and in pain from his wound he spots a friend Jose who is wounded and being carried on a stretcher. Before he can talk to Jose Cole is suddenly propelled into the future.Arriving in 1996 Cole kidnaps Dr. Railly and tries to convince her that he is from the future. He finds that Jeffrey Goines whose father is a famous virologist is now out of the asylum working for his father and has formed ""The Army of 12 Monkeys."" Cole is now racing against time and after a few mishaps finally decides that he wants to stay in 1996 with Dr. Railly surrendering to the inevitable destruction of human life.They travel to Philadelphia eventually finding a shabby storefront the headquarters of Jeffrey Goines' Army of the 12 Monkeys. The organization is dedicated to animal rights and freeing them from abusive laboratories. The members claim they've severed their ties with Jeffrey because he'd become too unpredictable radical and went to work for his father whom they consider their enemy.Kathryn and Cole travel to Jeffrey's father's mansion where Railly removes the bullet Cole had picked up in the trenches of World War I from his leg. Dropping his kinder demeanor Cole locks Railly in the trunk of their car and leaves her in the woods. In the middle of a fundraising dinner Cole meets with Jeffrey. Jeffrey rambles about how Cole while they were both housed in the asylum had given him the idea to release a virus that would destroy most of humanity. Cole leaves chased by security from the mansion and finds Railly in the woods. While he rants about wanting to stay in Railly's time a furious Railly honks the car's horn to try and attract attention from Dr. Goines' security who are searching for them. When she turns to find Cole he has disappeared again.Dr. Railly soon becomes convinced that somehow Cole knows something--his predictions of the outcome of minor events is too uncanny. The radio had been following the disappearance of a nine-year-old boy believed to have fallen into a mine shaft but just as Cole said the boy is found hiding in a barn and the disappearance was a prank played by the boy and his friends. The bullet she'd removed from Cole's leg proves to be pre-1920 and forces her to check a photograph from her own research taken on the battlefield which impossibly shows Cole in the trenches. She becomes convinced that ""The Army of 12 Monkeys"" indeed poses a threat and she begins searching for Cole in order to persuades him to take up his cause again.Railly continues her investigation of the clues Cole was collecting and makes her way to the same shabby storefront in the western district of Philadelphia she and Cole had visited earlier. While she pounds on their door Cole suddenly appears. He's now convinced himself that he is delusional and wants Railly to help him. Inside the storefront with his loyal followers and those who fear him Jeffrey is rambling about how Railly found him that she must have processed his thoughts through a complex computer system to predict his next location. He and his loyalists leave with him to carry out their plans. Ultimately they do not release the deadly virus but kidnap Jeffrey's father and place him in a paddock at the zoo and release all the zoo's animals into the streets of Philadelphia.Cole and Kathryn learn the 12 Monkeys plan from the news. Cole realizes that the 12 Monkeys are not the threat and he leaves a phone message to that effect. Shortly after Jose appears and approaches Cole with orders for him to complete his mission and hands him a revolver. Cole initially refuses but then notices a guard from the present glaring at him. Jose makes it clear Dr Railly will be killed if Cole does not comply.Meanwhile the police are after Cole for kidnapping Dr. Railly. In an airport while attempting with Cole to elude capture Dr. Railly recognizes Dr Peters a man who worked with Jeffrey Goines' father in the virology lab and who is ""an apocalypse nut."" She rushes to inform Cole and frantically identifies him along with his travel plans with Jose overhearing her rantings. The man goes through airport screening and manages to persuade security that his biological samples--one for each of the many cities on his itinerary--are harmless briefly opening one vial and holding it very close to the screener's nose. Dr. Railly alerts Cole and they attempt to stop the man. To Dr. Railly's horror Cole is shot by the police while chasing the real perpetrator who escapes to board his plane. Cole's death is witnessed by a boy named James who is with his parents: the young James Cole. Cole's dream is finally revealed as a memory of his own death. Young Cole and Dr. Railly lock eyes for a moment. James' mother tells her son to forget about the incident and the family walks out of the airport to their car.On the plane Peters takes his seat and starts a conversation with his fellow passenger. We recognize her as the lead scientist from Cole's present. Cole had stated once the virus was located a scientist would be sent back to study it in its original unmutated form so that a cure could be developed in the present. She identifies herself as ""Jones"" and cryptically says she's ""in insurance."""

An intense film about time travel this Sci-Fi entry was directed by Terry Gilliam a member of the comedy troupe Monty Python. The film stars Bruce Willis as James Cole a prisoner of the state in the year 2035 who can earn parole if he agrees to travel back in time and thwart a devastating plague. The virus has wiped out most of the Earth's population and the remainder live underground because the air is poisonous. Returning to the year 1990 six years before the start of the plague Cole is soon imprisoned in a psychiatric facility because his warnings sound like mad ravings. There he meets a scientist named Dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) and Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt) the mad son of an eminent virologist (Christopher Plummer). Cole is returned by the authorities to the year 2035 and finally ends up at his intended destination in 1996. He kidnaps Dr. Railly in order to enlist her help in his quest. Cole discovers graffiti by an apparent animal rights group called the Army of the Twelve Monkeys but as he delves into the mystery he hears voices loses his bearings and doubts his own sanity. He must figure out if Goines who seems to be a raving lunatic holds the key to the puzzle.
Claiming to be a time traveller from the distant 2035 James Cole--a delusional patient hospitalised in a 1990 mental institution--feels compelled to carry out his important mission: to save the world from a devastating virulent agent capable of annihilating billions. However as Cole's psychiatrist Dr Kathryn Railly senses that there is more to him than meets the eye a fateful encounter with another inmate--the unhinged Jeffrey Goines--will trigger a string of unfathomable events balancing between the past and the present sanity and insanity. Now all clues point to the extreme activist group known only as the Army of the Twelve Monkeys; nevertheless is the reality Cole so eloquently describes indeed true or is it only a disturbing but subjective hallucination?::Nick Riganas
"An unknown and lethal virus has wiped out five billion people in 1996. Only 1% of the population has survived by the year 2035 and is forced to live underground. A convict (James Cole) reluctantly volunteers to be sent back in time to 1996 to gather information about the origin of the epidemic (who he's told was spread by a mysterious ""Army of the Twelve Monkeys"") and locate the virus before it mutates so that scientists can study it. Unfortunately Cole is mistakenly sent to 1990 six years earlier than expected and is arrested and locked up in a mental institution where he meets Dr. Kathryn Railly a psychiatrist and Jeffrey Goines the insane son of a famous scientist and virus expert.::Giancarlo Cairella <vertigo@imdb.com>"
When Cole a convict volunteer is sent back in time to find information on a deadly virus that will destroy 5000000000 members of the human race in 1996-1997 he mistakenly arrives in 1990.

Terry Gilliam's nightmarish low-tech/high-tech future vision takes place in 1997 after a deadly virus has killed 99% of the human population--forcing the survivors to flee beneath our planet's surface. This leaves the (other) animals topside to rule the Earth once again. The scientists select James Cole an imprisoned sociopath to return to the past and gather information useful in the defense against this contagion. Once back in time he is to investigate the mysterious 'Army of the Twelve Monkeys' and report his findings. Scientific social and political themes like time travel (and its inherent paradoxes and nested loops) mental illness the nature of reality animal rights and the Armageddon-potential of unchecked technological advances are artfully and cleverly explored.::Tad Dibbern <DIBBERN_D@a1.mscf.upenn.edu>
