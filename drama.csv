"In London on Christmas Eve 1843 Ebenezer Scrooge (George C. Scott) is a bitter miserly businessman who does not share the merriment of Christmas. His loyal clerk Bob Cratchit (David Warner) comments that Jacob Marley has been dead for seven years but is gruffly ordered to return to work by Scrooge. Bob attempts to add some coal to an almost nonexistent fire but is stopped by Scrooge who gives him a curt and cutting lecture on clothing as protection against the cold and that ""coal burns coal is momentary and coal is costly"". Scrooge declares that there will be no more coal burned in the office that day and orders Cratchit to return to work lest he be fired.Bob returns to his desk as Scrooge's nephew Fred Holywell (Roger Rees) cheerfully enters the office; Scrooge mocks his cheerful demeanor calling Christmas a ""humbug"" a holiday that has never done anyone any good summing up his view with a very well-known quote in a mockingly cheerful manner ""If I could work my will every fool with 'Merry Christmas' on his lips would be boiled in his own pudding and buried with a stake of holly through his heart."" Despite this declaration Fred patiently states that his own views of how Christmas has benefited him in many ways even if not with momentary gain. ""Though it has not put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket it has done me good; and I say 'God bless it!'"" Bob applauds from his desk in the office only to be sternly warned by Scrooge that he will spend Christmas unemployed should he make more noise. Fred invites his uncle to dinner who curtly declines and dismisses his nephew with ""You are wasting my time.""Despite his uncle's rudeness Fred maintains his good humor wishing Bob and his family a Merry Christmas as he departs the office. Scrooge prepares to leave for the Exchange; he grudgingly gives Bob Christmas Day off with pay likening it to ""picking a man's pocket every twenty-fifth of December"" wanting him to be at work all the earlier the next day. As he leaves for the Exchange Scrooge encounters Bob's youngest son Tiny Tim waiting across from Scrooge's office. The lad is a naïve and very sick boy who walks with a crutch but is unfailingly cheerful and polite courteously greeting Scrooge as the man walks by. Scrooge mistakes Tim for a beggar but after the lad introduces himself Scrooge assures him that he will have a long wait for his father in the cold. Tim cheerfully thanks Scrooge and continues his wait for his father.In the stock exchange Scrooge is greeted by three other businessmen who wish to purchase some corn; they have delayed in concluding the deal apparently in hopes that Scrooge will lower his price. However Scrooge informs them to their dismay that the price has gone up 5% because of the delay and unless they come to an agreement the price would go up another 5% the next day. Before leaving Scrooge informs them that he will not ship without the cash in hand. After being approached by two gentlemen collecting money for charity Mr. Poole and Mr. Hacking Scrooge turns down their offer. In his house Scrooge encounters the ghost of his dead business partner Marley who warns him to repent his wicked ways or he will be condemned in the afterlife like he did carrying heavy chains for his own greedy ways. He informs Scrooge of the coming visits of three time-traveling spirits for that night.At one o'clock Scrooge meets the Ghost of Christmas Past who takes him back in time to his childhood and his early adult life. They visit Scrooge's time as a boarding school student when he spent the holidays alone with only his books for company. He sees his father Silas who has him become an employee for Fezziwig and his sister Fan who died after giving birth to Fred. Eventually becoming a successful career in money lending and business Scrooge becomes engaged to a woman named Belle. However the spirit shows Scrooge how Belle left him one afternoon when he expressed his reluctance towards focusing on his increasing finances or their relationship. The visions conclude with a display of Belle's married family several years later on Christmas Eve. When her husband informs her of sighting Scrooge she wistfully considers him a ""poor wretched man"". Unable to watch any more memories Scrooge puts out the Ghost of Past with its cap as he returns to the present.At two o'clock Scrooge meets the Ghost of Christmas Present who shows the joys and wonders of Christmas Day. Scrooge and the Ghost visit Bob's house learning his family is surprisingly content with their small dinner and Scrooge takes pity on Tim when he learns of his terminal health. The two then visit Fred's Christmas party and Fred's pity towards his uncle hoping to gain his uncle's trust on behalf of Fan. Scrooge and the spirit go to a desolate street and encounter a poor family whose father has ambiguously come across menial means of food and is considering taking the family to a poorhouse to get them off the streets. Before disappearing the Ghost of Present displays to Scrooge the youthful impoverished forms of Ignorance and Want. The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come arrives next appearing as a silent cloaked shadow and takes Scrooge into the future. Scrooge witnesses businessmen discussing the death of an unnamed colleague where they would only attend the funeral if lunch is provided. The spirit shows him that several of his possessions have been stolen and brought to a fence named Old Joe. The spirit transports Scrooge to Bob's residence where he learns that Tim has died. Scrooge is escorted to a cemetery where the spirit points out his own grave revealing Scrooge was the man who died. Realizing this Scrooge swears repentance and kindness on the remainder of his life and collapses sobbing on the tombstone.Awakening in his house on Christmas Day Scrooge finds the Ghosts of Christmas had visited him all in one night. Gleeful for his redemption Scrooge decides to surprise Bob's family with a turkey dinner ventures out with the charity workers and the citizens of London to spread happiness in the city and accepts Fred's invitation after reconciling with him. The following day he gives Cratchit a raise and becomes like a second father to Tim who survives and outgrows his crutches. A changed man Scrooge now treats everyone with kindness generosity and compassion; he now embodies the spirit of Christmas."

It is a dying profession as the number of buffalo roaming the plains is nowhere what it once was.

Although they are able to make good money working together there is an inevitable breaking point with only one man left standing at the end regardless if one or the other actually pulls the trigger on the other the issue being: a young Indian woman and her infant who join their camp out of it being an better option than the alternative with Charlie treating her like his possession; and/or a rare white buffalo which can garner more money for them than all the others combined it which Charlie has no qualms in killing but Sandy who wants to see it live as being a sacred beast to the Indians.::Huggo

San Francisco is preparing for the premiere of a new staging of the Puccini opera Turandot. The passionate story of the Chinese princess Turandot and the mysterious three riddles which are the key to her heart are on the lips of opera buffs throughout the city. At the same time a serial killer is haunting the gay bars of the city and is killing HIV positive young men. He paints the bodies of each of his victims with a red cross. Is this blasphemous sex play or the deeds of a mad homophobic? Local elections are around the corner and the religious right is losing no time capitalizing on the horror. They flood the television screens decrying the supposed moral degradation of homosexuality. A young gay East German medical student Stefan arrives in the city for a medical congress and is following the trail of his dead father a once high ranking AIDS researcher in the East. Stefan is investigating whether the HIV virus was an incremental result of secret human experiments that were conducted in US prisons in the seventies. Secret lists involving these biological experiments are rumored to have surfaced in San Francisco. Stefan's research is ridiculed by scientists and activists alike. Stefan begins to neglect his work and is drawn into San Francisco's gay club scene. In the midst of wide-spread AIDS education and strict safe sex clubs Stefan discovers that a shadow world is emerging on the border of death: people back-sliding into high-risk sex and HIV-infected gay men standing before the decision to fade away quietly or to fully live out once more their desires dreams and fears. More than once Stefan crosses the serial killer's trail and he comes to the attention of Homicide Detective Louise Tolliver the SFPD officer in charge of the investigation. The tough woman detective brings Stefan in for an interview. Like most people from the Eastern bloc countries Stefan distrusts officialdom and the police in particular. Stefan and Tolliver play a cat and mouse game but simultaneously seem to forge a strange connection. Despite warnings and the near hysteria building in the city Stefan continues to cruise in the clubs. He becomes involved with the enigmatic Jeffrey who fits vague descriptions of the murderer.. Its soon apparent that Jeffrey has been infected for year with HIV. His connection to a fundamentalist Christians is less apparent but proves fateful. Like the Chinese Princess Turandot Jeffrey doesn't believe in the signs of Stefan's feelings for him. Stefan wants to win Jeffrey's trust and affection but to achieve that he has to free Jeffrey from his own gay self-hatred. This requires a painful journey through Jeffrey's dark past and lays bare Stefan's own carefully repressed death wish. Motivated by a mixture of professional utility and personal sympathy Detective Louise Tolliver seeks further contact with Stefan in order to open up new avenues in the case. Stefan blocks her out of distrust. Unknowingly he is drawn ever deeper into the Christian fanatics' web of influence. Another murder is committed and the trail of the victim leads to the neurologist Dr. Burroughs who has also treated Jeffrey in the past. Stefan's suspicion falls again on Jeffrey who again pushes Stefan away. Then Stefan discovers that Burroughs is probably in possession of the secret government lists and that Burrough's influence is by no means confined to San Francisco. But by this time Stefan is the hunted just as Louise Tolliver begins to focus her investigation on him. Stefan senses the solution is near but he knows that he can conquer the endless ritual of destroying and being destroyed only if he confronts heads-on the greatest dangers: Jeffrey Burroughs and his own darkest side.::Jochen Hick

This complex 1996 drama directed by Harold Becker (Sea of Love) attempts to explore big-city corruption and the flexibility of what's right and wrong in the political arena. John Cusack plays the senior aide to mayor John Pappas (Al Pacino) a popular and seasoned politician whose administration is threatened when what seems to be an accidental shooting of a child reveals a nest of corruption and lifelong personal debts. This tests Cusack's loyalty to the man he thought he knew. Pacino turns in a finely textured performance as a man who has his own lofty ideals but whose pragmatism sets in motion a series of events with tragic results. Cusack admirably captures the essence of someone polished and savvy at his job but must cope with fundamental disillusionment. This political thriller suffers at times from a lack of focus but still offers an insightful and poignant treatise on the quagmire of politics in the modern age and the human toll it sometimes exacts.

True story of three British POWs and their attempt to escape from Nazi Germany.::Anonymous
In a POW camp the Nazis have placed the huts far from the boundary so that any escape tunnel would have to be a long one.

He has a vision of blood splashing out of an elevator in the hotel an image which is revisited several times throughout the film.Upon Danny's arrival at the hotel head chef Dick Hallorann (Scatman Crothers) recognizes that Danny is telepathic and speaks to him mentally to offer him some ice cream. He explains that he and his grandmother both had the gift; she referred to this communication as ""shining."" He also counsels Danny about the hotel hinting that something terrible had happened there and left a trace ""as if someone burned toast"" which only people who can ""shine"" will perceive. Danny questions Dick about what went on in the hotel and about Room 237 in particular as Danny can sense that Dick is especially afraid of that room. Though he strives to assure Danny that the images he sees in the hotel are just ""like pictures in a book"" and can't hurt him Dick sternly warns Danny to stay out of that room.Jack's mental health deteriorates rapidly once the family is alone in the hotel. He has writer's block sleeps too little and is irritable. Danny has visions of the two murdered Grady girls but tells no one. He continues to wonder about Room 237.While the weather is still relatively warm Jack's wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and Danny walk through a maze of tall hedges making a game out of it stopping at dead ends and fixing their mistakes.One day a ball rolls toward Danny as he plays with his toys. It appears to have come from the open door of Room 237 which Danny enters. At that moment Wendy comes running from the basement at the sound of Jack's screams in the lounge. He tells her that he had a nightmare in which he used an axe to chop Danny and her to pieces. As a disconcerted Wendy promises that ""Everything's gonna be okay"" Danny appears at the other end of the room looking disoriented and sucking his thumb. His sweater is ripped and there are bruises on his neck. He does not answer when Wendy asks what happened. She angrily accuses Jack of hurting Danny and takes the child back to their suite.Jack is furious about the accusation. He storms around the hotel making his way to the Gold Ballroom. Sinking defeatedly onto a stool at an empty bar his head in his hands Jack declares that he would sell his soul for one drink. When he looks up he discovers a bartender (Joe Turkel) who serves him a drink. Jack is nonplussed by the sudden appearance of the bartender and even addresses him by his name Lloyd. In the course of telling his troubles to Lloyd Jack reveals that he unintentionally dislocated Danny's shoulder the same accident Wendy mentioned to Danny's pediatrician earlier. Notably Jack states that the injury happened three years ago while in explaining the same story to the pediatrician Wendy said that Jack who vowed to quit drinking immediately following the accident has currently been sober for only five months.A frantic Wendy enters finding Jack seemingly alone at the bar; she pleads with him to investigate Danny's claim that ""a crazy woman"" attacked him in the bathtub of Room 237. Jack who acts a bit tipsy grudgingly agrees to go have a look.As Jack approaches the door to Room 237 Danny appears to be having a seizure in his own room. Dick back at his home in Florida stares wide-eyed as he picks up on a signal Danny is sending.Jack cautiously enters Room 237. The bedroom is empty and he proceeds to the bathroom. He watches lustfully as a young beautiful naked woman (Lia Beldam) pulls back the shower curtain and steps slowly out of the bathtub. The two approach each other and embrace in a passionate kiss. Jack catches a glimpse of their reflection in the mirror and sees the woman is actually a rotting corpse. He recoils in horror-- the young lady standing before him has transformed into an elderly woman (Billie Gibson); a walking corpse with rotten sagging skin. She cackles madly while reaching for him with outstretched arms. Stunned Jack staggers out of the room locking the door after him.When he reports back to Wendy Jack denies anything amiss in Room 237. Wendy suggests they take Danny to a doctor. Jack becomes irate lecturing Wendy on her thoughtlessness and blaming her for everything that's gone wrong in his life. Insisting that they can't leave the hotel because of his obligation to his employers he storms out returning to the Gold Room which is now the scene of an extravagant party with guests dressed in 1920's fashion. Lloyd serves him a drink and Jack strolls through the crowd. He doesn't get far when a butler carrying a tray runs into him spilling advocaat on his jacket. The butler convinces Jack to come into the bathroom to clean up.The butler introduces himself as Delbert Grady (Philip Stone). Jack remembers the story Mr. Ullman told him about a former caretaker named Grady murdering his family and confronts Grady with the information. Grady denies that anything of the sort took place and furthermore insists that Jack has ""always been the caretaker."" Jack is confused but seems to accept Grady's story. Grady goes on to tell Jack that Danny has ""a great talent"" and is using it to bring an ""outside party"" into the situation referring to Dick Halloran with a racial slur. Grady advises Jack on how to ""correct"" Danny and how to deal with Wendy if she interferes.Back in Florida Dick has had no luck contacting the people at the Overlook Hotel. Worried about Danny he books the next flight to Colorado.At the Overlook Wendy arms herself with a baseball bat and looks for Jack intent on leaving the hotel with Danny whether or not Jack agrees to come. Entering the lounge she spots Jack's manuscript left unattended next to the typewriter. She reads what Jack has been writing: hundreds of pages of repetitions of a single sentence: ""All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy."" She realizes that Jack has gone mad.Jack approaches from behind and asks sarcastically ""How do you like it?"" Wendy shrieks with alarm and wheels around to face him. A confrontation ensues as Jack demands to know her intentions regarding leaving the hotel with Danny while Wendy retreats brandishing the bat. She screams at Jack not to hurt her and he swears that he will not; instead he intends to kill her. Wendy hits Jack on the head with the bat at the top of a flight of stairs causing him to lose his balance and tumble down the staircase injuring his ankle in the process.Wendy drags Jack's limp body to the pantry and locks him inside just as he regains consciousness. Jack tells her he has sabotaged the radio as well as the snow cat stranding them all there. She goes outside to check on the snow cat and confirms what he told her.A few hours later Jack is roused from a nap by the sound of Delbert Grady's voice. Grady expresses disappointment and a lack of confidence in Jack but Jack assures him he can get the job done if given one more chance. The pantry door then suddenly unlocks.Wendy has fallen asleep in her room. Danny is in a trance carrying a knife and muttering ""redrum"" repeatedly. He takes Wendy's lipstick and writes ""REDRUM"" on the bathroom door. He begins shouting ""REDRUM"" which wakes Wendy. She clutches him to her then sees the reflection of the bathroom door in the mirror. Reversed it reads: ""MURDER."" At that instant banging sounds start coming from the door to the hallway.The sound is Jack swinging an axe at the locked door. Wendy grabs Danny and locks them in the bathroom. She opens a tiny snow banked window and pushes Danny out; he slides safely to the ground. She tries to get out the same window but cannot fit. She tells Danny to run and hide.Meanwhile Jack has chopped his way through the front door and calls out ""Wendy I'm home!"" Jack then knocks politely on the bathroom door. Wendy holds the knife and tries to steady herself as Jack begins chopping into the door. After chopping away one of the panels he sticks his head through and screams ""Heeeere's JOHNNY!"" (a reference to The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962)). Jack sticks his hand through the door to turn the lock. Wendy slashes at him with a knife cutting Jack's hand and sending him recoiling in pain. Jack continues to hack at the door with the axe until they both hear the low rumble of an approaching snow cat engine. He stalks out.The snow cat driver is Dick. Inside the hotel he calls out but gets no reply. Jack hiding behind a pillar leaps out and swings the axe into Dick's chest killing him. Danny hiding in a kitchen cabinet screams revealing his location. He clambers out of the steel cabinet and runs outside.Meanwhile Wendy has ventured from the bathroom and begun to search for Danny. The hotel has sprung to life and now even Wendy encounters its ghosts sights that shock and horrify her. At the same time axe-wielding Jack turns on the outdoor lights and follows Danny into the hedge maze.Danny realizes he is leaving a trail of footprints in the snow for Jack to follow. He carefully retraces his steps walking backwards in the same prints he'd just created in the opposite direction then covers the rest of his tracks and hides behind a hedge. When Jack arrives he sees that the trail of footprints ends abruptly giving him no clue as to which direction Danny took. He chooses a path and lurches deeper into the maze. Danny comes out of his hiding spot and follows his own footprints back to the maze's entrance.Wendy makes her way out of the hotel just as Danny emerges from the maze. Relieved she flings down the knife and embraces him. Jack bellows his frustration from within the maze. Danny and Wendy waste no time escaping in the snow cat that Dick used to get to the hotel. Jack hopelessly lost in the maze freezes to death.Right before the end credits the camera slowly zooms in on a wall in the hotel full of old photographs that chronicle the hotel's history. An old recording of ""Midnight the Stars and You"" echoes in the empty hallway. In the center of one picture is a young Jack. The caption reads ""Overlook Hotel July 4th Ball 1921."""

Yes but boxing reaches out in a visceral way to viewers too worn down by life's own battles to do more than manage to pay the mortgage and get the kids off to school each morning. So by gaining access to the viewers through boxing this film does further our national discussion of serious issues facing young women.Regardless of your position on the sport of boxing this film allows views to address serious themes of sexism gender identities for men and women sexual stereotypes for both men and women and the role of parental figures.

The last ten days of Adolf Hitler and his Third Reich during World War 2.
This war drama film is a German-Austrian project in black-and-white and released in 1955. It was produced by the Austrian film company Cosmopol-Film GmbH. The film depicts the last days of the war especially the last ten days in Hitler's life and the overall atmosphere in his Berlin bunker in April 1945. The film starts with young German Army captain Wüst making his way among the rubble of Berlin's buildings toward Hitler's bunker. Out of a group of four men only captain Wüst and a sergeant make it alive into the bunker. They are on a desperate mission to see Hitler and request urgent reinforcements for their commander General Busse who's in charge of the northern Kurland Army defending the Wriezen area. Despite several attempts by captain Wüst to personally see Hitler he is stonewalled by the commanding generals. For the next ten days Wüst will remain in Hitler's bunker as a liaison officer between Hitler's headquarters and general Busse. He will witness the final days of the Fuhrer and the desperation of his generals to stave off defeat by any cost. He will finally see Hitler and witness his madness about the outcome of the war about his belief in a miracle that would save Germany from defeat and about Hitler's conviction that German armies are still intact and available to relieve the surrounded Berlin from the Soviet pressure. Viewers will have the opportunity to see with a high degree of realism what it was like to be in Hitler's presence in his battered bunker surrounded by the Soviet Red Army which was only a few blocks away. Those watching this war drama will also have a chance to see some historical characters interact in Hitler's presence. Among them German military leaders such as Generals Burgdorf Krebs Jodl Keitel and Greim are depicted. Political leaders such as Martin Bormann Joseph Goebbels Hermann Göring Heinrich Himmler and Albert Speer also make an appearance. Eva Braun and Magda Goebbels are shown in certain scenes where Hitler's marriage ceremony takes place. But the most important characters of this anti-war film are the ordinary German people young and old who are among the victims of Hitler's dream of 'A 1000 year Reich'.::nufs68

Toots and May's marriage is one of Toots being dependent on his wife. Shortly after Toots and May arrive in London to visit with their grown children Bobby and Paula and their respective children Toots falls ill and dies. Toots' death brings to the surface the underlying strain that has always existed between May and both of her two children and the unhappy lives they have all led. Now specifically with Paula May is disapproving of her relationship with a construction worker named Darren. Not only does May think his occupation makes him beneath Paula he's also a married man. Darren is in an unsatisfying marriage but doesn't want to leave it if only because of his son. Even after May gets to know and like Darren she still encourages Paula to break up with him. The issue is that May herself has fallen in love with Darren the two who begin a sexual relationship. What will ultimately happen between May and Darren also depends on Darren who is floundering in his own life and doesn't really know what he wants or even if he did how to get it. What will happen may also depend on Paula if she finds out what's going on.::Huggo

"Trelkovsky (Roman Polanski) a quiet and unassuming Polish immigrant living in France rents an apartment in Paris whose previous tenant Egyptologist Simone Choule attempted to commit suicide by throwing herself out the third-floor window and through a pane of glass below. He visits Choule in the hospital but finds her entirely in bandages and unable to talk. Whilst still at Choule's bedside Trelkovsky meets Simone's friend Stella (Isabelle Adjani) who has also come to visit. Stella begins talking to Simone who becomes aware of her visitors. Initially showing some signs of agitation upon seeing them Choule soon lets out a disturbing cry then suddenly dies. It isn't clear which of the two has caused this reaction. Apparently unaware that Choule is now dead Trelkovsky tries to comfort Stella but dares not say that he never knew Simone instead pretending to be another friend. They leave together and go out for a drink and a movie (Bruce Lee's Enter The Dragon) where they fondle each other. Outside the theatre they part ways.As Trelkovsky occupies the apartment he is chastised unreasonably by his neighbors and landlord Monsieur Zy (Melvyn Douglas) for hosting a party with his friends from the clerical office where he works apparently having a woman over making too much noise in general and not joining in on a petition against another neighbor. Trelkovsky attempts to adapt to his situation but is increasingly disturbed by the apartment and its tenants. He frequently sees his neighbors standing motionless in the toilet room (which he can see from his own window) and discovers a hole in the wall with a human tooth stashed inside. He receives a visit and a letter from one Georges Badar (Rufus) who secretly loves Simone and has believed her to be alive and well. Trelkovsky updates and comforts the man and spends the night out with him drinking at various bars around the city. Gradually he changes his breakfast habits like Simone and shifts from Gauloises to Marlboro cigarettes.One evening Trelkovsky has a run-in with Stella who is with some friends of hers at a local bar where they talk about the late Simone. After a gathering at friend's house Stella invites Trelkovsky back to her apartment where she tries to seduce him. Trelkovsky is quite drunk and does not respond to her advances. He tells Stella about finding the human tooth in a wall in his apartment. He then tells a story about a man who lost his arm in an accident and wanted it buried. Trelkovsky instead passes out leaving Stella to instead sleep beside him.The next day Trelkovsky returns to his apartment where be becomes severely agitated and enraged when he sees that his apartment has been robbed while his neighbors and the concierge (Shelley Winters) continue to berate him for making too much noise... despite the fact that he appears to tiptoe around the apartment and watches his TV set without sound. He complains about the robbery to Zy but the landlord is unsympathetic and refuses to allow Trelkovsky to call the police for he wants the building to remain quiet and respectable. Over the next several days Trelkvosky becomes hostile and paranoid in his day-to-day environment (snapping at his friends slapping a child in a park) and his mental state progressively deteriorates as he isolates himself from society. One evening he imagines himself being attacked by a derelict in the hallway of the lobby in his apartment building while imagining it to be one of his neighbors Madame Dioz (Jo Van Fleet). He buys a wig and woman's shoes and goes on to dress up (using Simone's dress which he had found in a cupboard) and sits still in his apartment in the dead of night.He begins to suspect that Zy and neighbors had driven the previous tenant Simone to commit suicide by harassing her and in his increasingly twisted state of mind believes that they are trying to subtly change him into Simone so that he too will kill himself. He has visions of his neighbors playing football with a human head in the apartment courtyard and begins to see himself staring out of his own window and finds the toilet covered in hieroglyphs.After a night of drinking at a local bar Trelkovsky runs off to Stella for comfort and sleeps over at her apartment and confides in her about his fear that his neighbors are trying to kill him but she calmly tells him that it is all in his mind. The next morning after Stella has left for work he concludes that she too is in on his neighbors' conspiracy when a delivery man arrives outside her apartment with a packaged delivery. In his twisted mind Trelkovsky looks through the peakhole of the front door and sees Zy there. After the delivery man leaves Trelkvosky proceeds to wreak havoc in her apartment before departing and steals her hidden supply of money.That evening Trelkvosky is drinking at a local bar again when he makes the mistake of asking the barman where he can buy a gun. The barman and the manager throw him out of the bar from where the drunk Trelkvosky wanders into the street where he gets hit by a passing car driven by an elderly couple. The old man and woman stop and exit the car to check on him and he is not wounded too seriously. An doctor appears and gives him a sedative injection due to his odd behavior. As a result Trelkvosky perceives the elderly couple as landlord Zy and wife after which the couple return him to his apartment.By this point a deranged Trelkovsky dresses up again as a woman and throws himself out the apartment window in the exact same manner of Simone Choule before what he believes to be a clapping cheering audience composed of his neighbors in the courtyard. The suicide attempt in fact wakes up his neighbors (whom Trelkovsky sees as humanoid monsters decending upon him). The neighbors arrive at the scene together with the police just in time for the wounded Trelkovsky to crawl up to his apartment and jump one more time.The end of the movie is enigmatic. Trelkovsky is bandaged up at the local hospital in the same fashion as Simone Choule in the very same hospital bed. When Trelkovsky looks up two visitors come to visit him the next day. It happens to be Stella... and his own self standing before him in the exact same manner when Trelkvosky and Stella visited Simone in the hospital earlier. Trelkovsky then lets out the same disturbing scream that Simone had screamed. There is the possibility that this scene is not a flashback but that Trelkovsky is really Simone Choule and the whole supernatural cycle is about to start all over again.

The story of a century: a decades-long second World War leaves plague and anarchy then a rational state rebuilds civilization and attempts space travel.::Anonymous
A global war begins in 1940. This war drags out over many decades until most of the people still alive (mostly those born after the war started) do not even know who started it or why. Nothing is being manufactured at all any more and society has broken down into primitive localized communities. In 1966 a great plague wipes out most of what people are left but small numbers still survive. One day a strange aircraft lands at one of these communities and its pilot tells of an organization which is rebuilding civilization and slowly moving across the world re-civilizing these groups of survivors. Great reconstruction takes place over the next few decades and society is once again great and strong. The world's population is now living in underground cities. In the year 2035 on the eve of man's first flight to the moon a popular uprising against progress (which some people claim has caused the wars of the past) gains support and becomes violent.::Kevin Steinhauer <K.Steinhauer@BoM.GOV.AU>

Suddenly an explosion blows a hole through the wall and inside is Maria Braun (Hanna Schygulla) and Hermann Braun (Klaus Lowitsch) about to get married. What is supposed to be a ceremonial and memorable moment for them has turned violent as bombs are going off around them. The setting is Berlin during World War II. As the ceremony is brought to a halt by the bombs the Priest attempts to leave only to be stopped by Hermann. Separated for a brief moment as bombs continue to rain around them Maria Hermann and Priest take cover on the ground and are finally able to sign their marriage license. After the opening of the credits we see Marias mother eating a small piece of bread with a tiny drizzle of oil. The economic times are bad. Maria returns after being unable to sell off her wedding dress. However she does not return empty handed. Amongst the things she brings back is a shaving brush. Then catching a photo of her husband Hermann she begins to break into tears. Hermann has been sent to the front. With her mother cheering her up they decide to cook up some potatoes with bacon.
With a poster hanging behind her back with the information of Hermann Maria waits with anticipation at the train station where the women wait for the men to arrive from the war. However Hermann doesn't show up. Taking refuge in a soup kitchen Maria talks to a woman working in the kitchen about the death of her husband in the war and remarriage. These are desperate times for everyone as several men dive for a cigarette butt thrown by a soldier. Heckled by a couple of American soldiers Maria's strength is revealed as she confronts one of them only to be given a packet of cigarettes. She decides to give it to her mother only in exchange for her brooch which the mother agrees to. In the following scene we see Maria once again roaming the city with the poster of Hermann hanging on her back. This time she is accompanied by her friend Betti Klenze (Elisabeth Trissenaar) who also has a poster of her husband Willy Klenze (Gottfried John) dangling on her back. Near the end of the day they help each other put on heavy makeup in order to search for a job that their husbands might or might not approve. Maria believes that Hermann would have no qualms about her. On the following day Maria meets up with a peddler (Rainer Werner Fassbinder) who trades a dress for her in return for Maria's brooch. She wears the elegant dress and manages to find a job as a waitress in a bar. Paying a visit to her childhood doctor (Claus Holm) she asks for a health certificate for her new employer. The following morning she returns back to the train station and doesn't find Hermann. Giving up on her hope she tears Hermann's photo off and tosses the poster board onto the train tracks. At her new job at the bar she meets and shares a dance with Bill (George Eagles) an African-American soldier. Spending an afternoon in the woods as Bill teaches Maria English their relationship suddenly has become more passionate and intimate. In the next scene we see Betti reunited with her husband Willy. However he brings with him the news of Hermann's death. Maria returns and is shocked to find Willy back. Although ecstatic to have Willy back Maria cries because her husband is not with her. Her only means of comfort now is in Bill. As Bill and Marias relationship begins to grow more intimate and close she soon finds herself pregnant with his child. As they celebrate the announcement and preparing to make love they are paid an unexpected visit. It is Hermann. As Bill and Hermann wrestle each other Maria grabs a bottle and hits Bill across the head which kills him. As the Americans put Maria on trial Hermann takes responsibility and admits that he is the one who killed Bill. As Hermann is put in jail Maria says that she will wait for him so that they can start a new life together. Furthermore in spite of picturing their future with a new child Maria tells her doctor that she is going to abort it. In the meantime Maria focuses on attaining wealth. During a train ride she meets Karl Oswald (Ivan Desny) in first class a half-German a half-French business who owns a factory in Germany. He has returned to restart it after enduring difficult times during the war. Changing to her more seductive dress Maria strikes a conversation with him. However her nonchalant and in different attitude ultimately attracts him. He also admires her firm demeanor as Maria is able to drive away a drunk and noisy American soldier from the train. As they share a car ride with Karls accountant Senkenberg (Hark Bohm) Karl decides to give her a job as his personal advisor. Later as she tells her family about her new position Maria decides to move out of her mothers house in order to prepare for a future home with Hermann much to the disagreement of those around her especially Betti. Visiting Hermann in prison she tells him that she is going to change thanks to this job. In one of her first duties as personal assistant she becomes a translator for Karl and an English speaking customer. However she doesn't translate faithfully in order to tell Karl what he wants to hear. As Karl and Senkenberg argue over whether or not the company can afford to buy three SE Machines Maria asks for 30-minutes alone with the customer. In the scene that follows Karl congratulates Maria with a toast for her contribution. However Senkenberg remains skeptical as he would only drink in five years time of the company. As Karl reprimands Senkenberg for not being able to have fun Maria jumps to his defense. We soon find Maria in bed with Karl. He even asks her to be with him over the weekend in the country. However she tells him that she has to visit someone on the weekend. Maria though does not divulge the fact that she is going to visit her husband. As Karl tries to understand her and show her his affection Maria shrugs it away. Instead she chooses to talk about her salary as she tells him that she has to earn a lot of money over the next few years. On the day Maria visits Hermann she tells him that she is sleeping with Karl. She reassures him that she wants to sleep with him because she is dependent on him. Furthermore she does it in order to give herself the upper hand. Upon returning home Maria finds Karl waiting for her. Having spent the night together Karl lets it known that he was going to propose to her had she gone with him to the country. Maria tells him that she will never marry him but is willing to settle as his mistress. In a business event Maria finds out from Willy that his marriage with Betti is in trouble for he is unable to communicate with her. Willy describes her as someone who cooks for me. In the following scenes Karl once again reiterates his love for Maria. Yet his love remains unrequited as she simply offers her body to him. One day Karl pays a visit to Hermann in order to meet the man that Maria loves. Karl makes a secret deal with Hermann that if he stays away from Maria until Karl dies than they will get the company. Later on her mothers birthday Maria finds that her mother has a new lover. During the party Betti reveals that she is losing Willy. Like the strong assertive woman that she is Maria tells her that she can do something about it. As Maria dances with Karl he declares his love fully realizing that he is going to die soon because of his liver.
Finally on the day of Hermann's release she realizes that he has left to Australia or Canada. As agreed upon with the deal between Hermann and Karl Hermann will leave a rose every month for her to remember him by. Maria soon loses herself in her job. Her personality begins to transform as her once firm demeanor evolves into certain ruthlessness. Her family co-workers and Karl become victims to her change. As the film draws to its end Karl passes away. Hermann finally returns back to Maria.

The Kid mocks their sentiments using a puppet.Morris approaches Apollonia to join the girl group. He buys some fancy champagne and tries to convince her that The Kid can't help her kick-start her career since he can hardly get his own career off the ground.

His buddies laugh but Morris quickly regrets what he said.The Revolution goes up to play. Before the song The Kid announces that they're playing a song written by Wendy and Lisa which he dedicates to his father. The song is ""Purple Rain"". It thrills the crowd so much that even Billy sheds a tear. Once the song ends The Kid goes backstage and plans to hop on his motorcycle but he hears the enthusiastic cheering and goes back where the other musicians congratulate him and cheer him on. He sees Apollonia as well who appears to have forgiven him. He returns to the stage and plays ""I Would Die 4 U"".

She's fiercely even foolishly proud. Can she make peace with anyone she loves or is she left to rage against the dying of the light?::<jhailey@hotmail.com>
"Now in the twilight of her life Hagar Shipley née Currie currently lives with her eldest son Marvin Shipley and daughter-in-law Doris Shipley who want against her wishes to place her in a nursing home. Rather than go along with their wishes Hagar decides to go on a journey both literally and figuratively. She runs away to her old hometown of Manawaka Manitoba specifically to the now abandoned and dilapidated farmhouse where she lived with her husband Bram Shipley and their two children. Along the way she reminisces about her less than conventional and less than trouble-free life. That trouble basically stemmed from her relationships to those in her family: her father Jason Currie who disowned her when she got married to Bram; Bram who had a different outlook on what was important in life despite the two being compatible sexually; Marvin who she saw as an extension of his father and thus was often the neglected child; and younger son John Shipley who she doted upon as having the ""Currie"" temperament within the family but who rebelled against her in his early adulthood. In her return to Manawaka Hagar meets a drifter named Leo who in reminding her of John makes her examine her past decisions more closely.::Huggo"

"In 1996 treasure hunter Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) and his team aboard the research vessel Keldysh search the wreck of RMS Titanic for a necklace with a rare diamond the Heart of the Ocean. They recover a safe containing a drawing of a young woman wearing only the necklace. It is dated April 14 1912 the day the ship struck the iceberg. Rose Dawson Calvert (Gloria Stuart) claiming to be the person in the drawing visits Lovett and tells of her experiences aboard the ship.
In 1912 Southampton 17-year-old first-class passenger Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) her fiancé Cal Hockley (Billy Zane) and her mother Ruth (Frances Fisher) board the Titanic. Also boarding the ship at Southampton are Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) a down-on-his-luck sketch artist and his Italian friend Fabrizio (Danny Nucci). Young Rose angry and distraught that her mother has apparently arranged the marriage considers committing suicide by jumping from the stern; Jack manages to pull her back over the rail after she loses her footing & nearly falls into the propellers. Discovered with Jack Rose tells Cal that she was peering over the edge and Jack saved her from falling. Cal is indifferent but when Rose indicates some recognition is due he offers Jack a small amount of money. After Rose asks whether saving her life meant so little he invites Jack to dine with them in first class the following night along with several prominent first-class passengers - including the Countess of Rothes Archibald Gracie (Bernard Fox) Thomas Andrews (Victor Garber) Molly Brown (Kathy Bates) and John Jacob Astor (Eric Braeden) & his wife. Jack and Rose develop a tentative friendship though Cal and Ruth are wary of him. Following dinner Rose secretly joins Jack at a party in third class. During the party Cal's butler Spicer Lovejoy (David Warner) stealthily sneaks down the third class staircase to spy on her.
After a very tense breakfast the following morning in which Cal shows an inclination towards violence Rose becomes even more apprehensive about her upcoming marriage. Ruth emphasizes that Rose's marriage will resolve the DeWitt Bukaters' financial problems. After spotting Rose Cal and Ruth out on the Boat Deck Jack stealthily sneaks back into First Class and tries to warn Rose about what she may be facing. Rose rebuffs Jack's advances but later realizes that she prefers him over Cal. After meeting on the bow at sunset Rose takes Jack to her state room and displays Cal's engagement present: the Heart of the Ocean. At her request Jack sketches Rose posing nude wearing it. Meanwhile in the First-Class Smoking Room Cal's butler informs him that none of the stewards have seen Rose at all that night. Cal orders the butler to find her. Rose & Jack manage to evade Cal's bodyguard and have sex in an automobile inside the cargo hold. They later visit the forward well deck and while on it the lookouts spot an iceberg directly in the ship's path. Orders are given to turn the ship hard a-starboard and run the engines full astern but the ship takes too long to make the turn and the starboard side scrapes along the iceberg causing substantial damage to the watertight compartments including the cargo hold where Jack & Rose had been having sex in the automobile. Jack & Rose witness the collision with the iceberg and overhear the officers and designer discussing its seriousness.
On the bridge builder Thomas Andrews Captain Smith (Bernard Hill) the ship's officers and White Star Line Managing Director Bruce Ismay (Jonathan Hyde) discuss the damage. The water has reached 14 feet above the keel in 10 minutes and has flooded 5 watertight compartments. Mr. Andrews warns that because of a design flaw the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads at E Deck and this will cause the ship to sink. He gives an hour two at most for the ship to remain afloat.
Cal discovers Jack's sketch of Rose and a mocking note from her in his safe along with the necklace. When Jack and Rose attempt to tell Cal of the collision he has his butler slip the necklace into Jack's pocket and accuses him of theft. He is arrested taken to the Master-at-arms' office and handcuffed to a pipe. Cal puts the necklace in his own coat pocket.
With the ship sinking Rose is desperate to free Jack. She flees Cal and her mother who has boarded a lifeboat and rescues him. They return to the boat deck where Cal and Jack encourage her to board a lifeboat; Cal claims he can get himself and Jack off safely. After Rose boards one Cal tells Jack the arrangement is only for himself. As her boat lowers Rose decides that she cannot leave Jack and jumps back on board. Jack confronts her angrily at first but his angers soon turns to affection and they share a series of kisses at the bottom of the Grand Staircase. Cal seeing this takes his butler's pistol and chases Rose and Jack into the flooding first class dining saloon. After using up his ammunition Cal realizes he gave his coat and consequently the necklace to Rose. Jack & Rose are forced to flee below decks to escape Cal and narrowly escape drowning themselves. They become trapped behind a locked gate but Jack manages to free them just as the rising water reaches their heads.
Out on the Boat Deck Cal decides to make his own escape. He reminds the First Officer of the arrangement made earlier but the officer angrily turns on Cal and refuses to allow him boarding. When he spots a lost child hiding behind a winch he takes the child and is subsequently allowed into a collapsible lifeboat by Chief Officer Wilde. As Cal and others board the collapsible the water surges into the bridge & wheelhouse drowning Captain E.J. Smith and causing Cal's boat to start floating off the deck. By now the stern is staring to rise out of the water and the remaining passengers are running farther & farther aft.
After braving several obstacles Jack and Rose return to the boat deck. All the lifeboats have departed and passengers are falling to their deaths as the stern rises out of the water. Water now crashes through the huge dome over the Grand Staircase drowning those passengers trapped inside. Jack & Rose reach the very stern - where they had first met - and take up positions on it by climbing over the rail next to Chief Baker Charles Joughin. The ship breaks in half causing the stern to crash down into the water and killing Lovejoy the butler. As the bow breaks off it pulls the stern back into the air leaving it sitting there for a minute. Jack and Rose ride it into the ocean as it fills with water and then plunges to the bottom. As Jack & Rose let go of the stern the Titanic disappears into the darkness below them and they both swim to the surface to find themselves in a massive mob of passengers and crew. Within minutes Rose & Jack find a piece of paneling from the Grand Staircase and he helps her onto the wooden panel only buoyant enough for one person. Holding the edge he assures her that she will die an old woman warm in her bed. He dies of hypothermia but she is saved when Fifth Officer Lowe & some crewmen return to try to find survivors.
With Rose hiding from Cal en route the RMS Carpathia takes the survivors to New York. There she gives her name as Rose Dawson. She later learns that Cal committed suicide after losing everything in the 1929 Wall Street Crash.
Lovett abandons his search after hearing Rose's story. Alone on the stern of the Keldysh Rose takes out the Heart of the Ocean - in her possession all along - and drops it into the sea over the wreck site. While she is seemingly asleep in her bed photos on her dresser depict a life of freedom and adventure partly inspired by Jack. A young Rose returns to the ship - at first a gloomy wreck on the bottom - but as Rose reaches the Promenade Deck the ship begins to glow with light. As she enters the Grand Staircase she is greeted by those who perished on the ship - including the Titanic's band First Officer Murdoch Thomas Andrews Jack's friends Fabrizio & Tommy Ryan and standing at the clock is Jack himself. He extends a hand and they reunite to the happy cheers of the perished passengers & crew."

"A hip African-American angel returns to Earth to help a Jewish tailor re-examine his life. (Josiah Howard ""Blaxploitation Cinema: The Essential Reference Guide."")The story opens with Morris Mishkin an elderly Jewish tailor (played by Zero Mostel) at the welfare office trying to get assistance paying for his wife's medicine. When he returns home we see that he and his wife Fanny live in a deteriorating neighborhood in New York City. Fanny (played by Ida Kaminska) is in bed and appears to be very ill. Morris tries to make her comfortable and then sits down to rest. Fanny tells Morris that she'd promised her friend that Morris would sew a new suit for her friend's son. Morris tells Fanny he will not as the woman still owes him for a suit he made for her. Fanny says that she told her friend not to worry about the money. This upsets Morris who tells Fanny angrily that they need the money and he will not make the suit. Fanny becomes so upset she knocks over the tray of medications on her nightstand and then falls limp on the bed. Morris goes to her worried and tries to revive her. It appears as though she has died. Morris summons a friend to come immediately. He then recites a prayer to God to help him and falls asleep from exhaustion.When Morris awakens it is dark and as he gets up to turn on lights he finds a young black man sitting at his kitchen table. He is frightened that the man is there to harm him and frantically searches for a weapon coming up with a ladle instead of the knife that he he'd been reaching for. The man (played by Harry Belafonte) calmly takes the ladle and puts it away. Morris is having difficulty breathing so the man helps him sit down and asks if he can help. Morris asks for water and when the man opens a cupboard to get a water glass Morris jumps to grab a jar that has some money in it. The man returns the money jar to the cupboard and takes out a water glass. Morris also indicates he needs a pill that is near the sink which the man gets for him.Having finally regained his composure Morris asks the man who he is. The man introduces himself as Alexander Levine. Confused Morris asks him ""You're Jewish?"" Alex answers that he was Jewish and had been so willingly up until then. When Morris asks why he is no longer a Jew Alex reveals that he is an Angel sent by God to help Morris. Morris cannot believe the man is an Angel and asks why he has no wings. Levine says that he is only recently deceased and has to help somebody first. Morris asks him to perform a miracle and Levine says he cannot yet perform miracles. Morris keeps trying to get the man to leave as his wife is gravely ill. When he says this the angel tells him that she is resting. Morris rushes to Fanny's side and sees that she is indeed resting and is in a different position on the bed from when he last saw her.The doorbell rings and Morris rushes to answer. He looks in the kitchen quickly; Alex is still in there. When Morris answers the door he finds Dr. Berg (played by Mila O'Shea) the friend he'd called earlier. When Dr. Berg asks what the emergency was first Morris tells him about his visitor. Dr. Berg looks in and there's no one there. Morris tells Dr. Berg that Fanny was very ill. They enter her bedroom where she's sitting up alert and healthy looking. She does not seem to recall the earlier argument or that she'd either fainted or possibly died. The doctor sends Morris out of the room so he can examine Fanny who he is surprised to find feeling well.Meanwhile Morris tries to return to the kitchen but the door is locked... and Morris goes around to look in a tiny window to see Levine on the telephone. Alex has called a woman named Sally (played by Gloria Foster). In their conversation it comes out that Alexander owed some money to a someone who is sending people to collect it or kill him and they've been harrassing Sally. He arranges to meet with her at a bar.When Dr. Berg finishes the exam he exits the bedroom and wonders just what it was that made Morris call him earlier. Morris asks Dr. Berg to look in the kitchen. This time he sees Alex just as he's hanging up the phone. The Dr. Berg introduces himself and asks Alex who he is. He replies that he's an angel and asks Dr. Berg if he believes that. Dr. Berg replies yes... and Alex says 'just like that?' ...and Dr. Berg reaffirms and calls his wife to let her know he will be home soon. Alex asks Dr. Berg what's wrong with Mrs. Mishkin and he explains that her heart does not properly pump blood. The trouble is he explains it in a very technical way and Alex doesn't understand. Dr. Berg finally tells him that Fanny is dying and that no angel or medicine will stop it.Alex becomes upset that nobody believes he is an angel and he leaves. Almost immediately Fanny starts coughing uncontrollably. When Dr. Berg and Morris go in to check on her she complains that she cannot breath and that she feels almost as if she's drowning. The doctor makes her as comfortable as possible and gives Morris a prescription to get filled at the local pharmacy. He leaves and Morris rushes to the drugstore. When he gets there he finds out that the meds cost more than he has and pleads with the pharmacist to sell it to him at a discount. The pharmacist explains it is a new medication and must be sold as prescribed. During this exchange we see Alex watching through the window. Morris leaves with the prescription in his hand which Alex snatches and goes in to the store where he creates a distraction sneaks behind the pharmacy counter and pockets the pill bottle on the counter. He then exits the store and gives the pills to Morris.When they return to the apartment Morris keeps asking Alex how he got the pills without the prescription and how he paid for them. He realizes that Alexander stole the pills and begins complaining. Alex than tells him to take the money from the jar in the kitchen and go pay for the pills. Morris states that is their grocery money and Alexander retorts ""Do you want to eat or do you want your wife's pills""? Morris realizes he needs both. He then invites Alex to a drink at a bar. When they get there Sally shows up and Morris uses that as an opportunity to ditch Alexander.Morris returns home and checks on Fanny... Morris wants to go to bed and Fanny wants to talk. Alex and Sally show up... Alex has a few private words with Morris who first shuts the door on Sally then reopens it and beckons her in. Morris lets them in and allows them to use a spare room to talk. Sally tells Alex about the people looking for their money and asks if he has it. He tells her that the money won't be a problem anymore but does not tell her he is an angel. They talk and at one point start to kiss and fool around on the bed. Morris opens the door to check on them closes it and starts to make a lot of noise in the bathroom then running the sewing machine to make a suit which Fanny tells him to stop. Alex tells Sally she is all he has all that will be left of him when he's gone and tells her he truly loves her... and Sally tries to talk with Alex about their future and states that she wants to marry him. He tells her he can't but won't say why. They argue Sally provokes Alex with insults and Alex slaps Sally so she leaves.Morris finds Alex lying listlessly on the bed and offers to talk and help. Alex doesn't say much puts on his coat and leaves the apartment going up to the roof. Morris follows him and finds him standing on the ledge as if about to jump. He states that no one believes in him or cares and Morris tells him that he believes and cares and that Alex should come back to the apartment and be welcome.When they return Fanny is up and has set the table for dinner. She asks about Alex and when Morris introduces him as a friend she says ""Be welcome"" and sets another place at the table. Alex states he is an angel and Fanny stops looks at him and asks if he has come to take her. He replies that no he's come to help her live and she states that she wants no help and has been ready to die for some time now. She then leaves the two men alone and lies down on the bed. Morris and Alexander eat dinner drink wine and enjoy the meal.As they talk Alex says he can feel a change ever since Fanny saw him. Morris still won't believe Alex is an angel sent from God and he begins to tell Alex that he doesn't believe in God anymore. This conversation has begun to upset Alex who begins to cry out. The two men begin to argue and as Morris continues to complain about God Alex begins to fade away until he is gone. Morris looks in on Fanny then sits down and begins laughing hysterically finally falling asleep.Later Dr. Berg shows up and goes to examine Fanny who tells him that she does not feel well; he suspects her time has come. He wants to call an ambulance to take her to a hospital but she refuses saying she wants to die in her own bed in her own home. He wants to call in Morris but Fanny says no. He tells her that Morris has a right to be there to which she replies that over the years they shared many things but that she did not want to share this. She allows Morris to look in and they start speaking in the their old language (Yiddish perhaps) and finally as he turns to go he looks at her lovingly waves his hand and says a final goodbye.As he exits the room he notices a hat that Alex left behind. We then see Morris wandering around New York with the hat showing it to various black people who shake their heads. He then spies a synagogue and goes in. He sees a group of young black people praying and sits down in a pew. Then he's gone and has left the hat behind. As he wanders back home through an open lot a black feather floats overhead. He tries to catch it but it stays just out of his reach... and the last we see is the feather dancing in the sky."

The film opens with a fade-in on helicopters circling over what turns out to be dead bodies floating in the sea at Piraeus the port of Athens. The main character Alexander a television reporter (Gregory Karr) explains in a voice-over that he was on his way to a border town to do a story on refugees. The bodies are those of stowaways who were refused asylum by the Greek authorities and rather than be returned to their own countries jumped to their deaths. The reporter sets up the theme of the film as he wonders How does one leave? Why? To where?In the second scene Alexander is now near the Greek-Albanian border accompanied by a Greek colonel (Ilias Logothetis). After passing a few troops in review during which the soldiers make totally incongruous remarks they walk to a bridge which fords a river separating Albania from Greece. The colonel points out a tricolor line which bisects the bridge. He lifts one leg as if to take a step over the line but his leg remains suspended as he says If I take one more step Im elsewhere or I die. The Albanian guards are somewhat nervous and on alert. The colonel stands still in that position for a moment and then slowly brings his leg back into Greece.The two men next drive into the small border village nicknamed the waiting room where the colonel explains thousands of refugees are stranded waiting for the Greek authorities to give them their papers to go elsewhere. Alexander wanders along the riverfront market where he spots for the first time a person he seems to recognize as a famous Greek politician (Marcello Mastroianni) who had inexplicably disappeared some time ago and now seems to have resurfaced here as an anonymous refugee. Later on Alexander rejoins the rest of his crew at a local hotel where they settle for the duration of their assignment. The entire crew walks to another section of the town where they begin filming with a long tracking shot along a line of boxcars that have become the temporary shelter for refugees from all over Eastern Europe the Balkans and the Middle East.Cut next to an elegant reception in a town obviously not the waiting room where Alexander has arranged to meet with the politicians French wife (Jeanne Moreau). She relates her husbands first temporary disappearance after he had written a controversial book Despair at the End of the Century and his return as another man. In a close-up of the cover of the book we see the portrait of the politician (Mastroianni). In the next scene in Alexanders apartment the politicians wife arrives and gives the reporter an audiotape that her husband made before leaving her for the second and final time. They listen to the tape and then go for a walk during which the politicians wife provides more information about her husband and his strange behavior.Alexander returns to the waiting room. At the bar of the hotel where he and his crew stay the crew members are drinking and dancing while Alexander sits alone drinking at table. A young woman (Dora Chrisikou) at a nearby table stares insistently at him. Eventually she follows Alexander back to his room. After she leaves Alexander walks back to the row of boxcars where he encounters the politician telling a young boy the story of the future Great Migration but the man fails to reveal the storys ending. Some time later Alexander meets the young woman in a café and then stalks her following her as she returns to her building a place where refugees live in crowded and tenuous conditions. When he enters her small room she relates to him how her mother died while crossing the border and she says she now takes care of her two younger siblings. The politician (her father?) enters and says that he has been at work repairing telephone lines which run along the border. Over a drink the politician ponders his circumstances: We crossed the border but were still here. How many borders must we cross before we are home?Alexander goes to the train station to meet the politicians wife. He has pre-arranged a chance meeting between the woman and the man he believes is her husband. This meeting takes place the next morning on a bridge in the town. The crew is filming the encounter which is entirely seen through the cameras eye. The two stop and for a brief moment stare at each other. She then turns toward the camera and states Its not him.We see some old original footage of the politician at a time when he was to make a very important speech to the Assembly but instead just made a short statement and abruptly left. Following this scene while standing by a river Alexander confronts the politician with the tape recording he gave his wife before leaving her but it produces no reaction on the politicians part. He simply ignores it. On returning to the village Alexander meets up with the colonel who has been all along commenting on the conditions of the waiting room and keeping Alexander informed of the latest gossip and happenings. He tells Alexander that there will be a wedding between a refugee girl from the village and her childhood sweetheart who lives across the border. As they talk the girl who is to be married enters the bar: it is the same girl Alexander slept with a few nights earlier. Alexander is obviously shaken. They meet again at his hotel and we assume they will make love one last time.The next scene is one of the most remarkable of the film a scene like only Angelopoulos can produce. On a grey mournful morning a small group assembles with the bride and her father -- the politician -- on the Greek shore of the river that marks the border. They face another small crowd standing on the opposite shore with the groom. When the Orthodox priest arrives the wedding commences. It is eventually interrupted by a single gunshot which disperses the two groups. That same evening Alexander meets the bride still in her wedding dress who is dancing with her father.The next morning Alexander returns to the bridge on the border and repeats the suspended step as acted out by the colonel at the beginning of the film. He meets the colonel who tells Alexander that several people had seen the politician leaving the village by different means in different directions but all agreed that he was carrying a suitcase. The colonel further states that he is unable to confirm or deny these stories about the vanished politician.The film ends with another striking scene of men in yellow rain suits on the top of telephone polls which run along the border-river stringing telephone wires from pole to pole.

"In mid 1941 prior to the United States' entry into World War II Major Chick Davis and Captain Buck Oliver of the United States Army Air Force argue about the most efficient bombing method. Buck a pilot advocates that pilots should dive bomb their own targets while Chick argues for the high altitude precision bombing of the bombardier. In a contest between the two methods the bombardiers win the challenge and Chick is assigned to establish a school for bombardier training at Hughes Field in New Mexico. The field is run by Burton ""Burt"" Hughes an attractive woman whose father was a respected general and with whom Buck is in love. Chick at first disapproves of Burt's presence at his school but soon begins to rely on her efficiency. Although still convinced that bombardiers are inferior to pilots Buck arrives at the base to fly the new trainees. Among the new cadets are Burt's brother Tom Joe Connors girl-crazed Ignacius ""Chito"" Rafferty Paul Harris and Jim Carter who develops a crush on Burt. While flying a mission one day Buck disputes a bombardier's authority to decide a pilot's heading prompting Chick to vow that when his trainees graduate they will receive commissions that grant them equal rank with pilots. After passing their ground training the cadets begin aerial training. While on a test flight the controls on Buck's plane freeze and Buck orders the cadets to parachute to safety. When Tom panics and refuses to jump Carter knocks him unconscious and informs Buck that everyone has bailed out. After Buck jumps from the plane Carter takes charge of the cockpit and saves Tom's life by unjamming the controls and landing the plane on its belly. Out of gratitude for saving her brother's life Burt agrees to go out with Carter and they begin dating. Tom is considered for elimination from training because of his refusal to parachute but Chick agrees to give him another chance. While piloting another flight Buck's oxygen equipment fails and he passes out. When the plane suddenly plunges out of control Tom falls out of the plane's escape hatch to his death. Although a board of inquiry finds Buck innocent of negligence he requests a transfer and leaves without saying goodbye to Burt who has taken a leave of absence. A few months later after the bombing of Pearl Harbor the bombardiers win their commissions and are called into active service. Now a colonel Chick asks Burt to marry him but she refuses telling him that he is too much like her father. At the airfield as the bombardiers board their planes Burt embraces Carter and asks Sergeant Dixon Chick's assistant to give Buck a letter telling him that he is forgiven. After crossing the Pacific and landing at an island base Chick and Buck meet again. Chick tells Buck that his mission is to fly low over a Japanese base near Nagoya and light up the camp for a surprise bombing attack. That night Buck and Dixon take off but are shot down by the Japanese before completing their mission. After they are taken prisoner Dixon remembers Burt's letter and is about to hand it to Buck when a Japanese soldier intercepts it. The Japanese then begin to torture the Americans to force them to divulge the location of their base. Just as a Japanese soldier begins to taunt them that their mission has been a failure the hum of American bombers is heard overhead and the camp goes dark. In the ensuing chaos Dixon is shot but Buck escapes and drives a flaming truck through the camp setting the base on fire and lighting it up for the bombardiers. In the air the bombardiers drop their missiles on the target knowing that a hit will mean Buck's death. As his comrades' bombs explode around him Buck finds Burt's letter and dies a happy man as the bombs take him and most of the Japanese soldiers out."

"There is an anachronism: The $1 bills depicted are Federal Reserve Notes which weren't put into circulation until 1963. Furthermore it appears that the director was aware that in 1957 the phrase ""In God We Trust"" had not yet become standard on the reverse side of all U.S. currency because most (if not all) the bills shown are face up. I consider it unrealistic that a bunch of gamblers around a craps table would all have their money face up when thrown onto the table. It appears that those bills are contemporary (i.e. from the era when the film was made) and therefor would have had the phrase on the reverse. The director was apparently not aware that the $1 bills in circulation at that time were nearly all silver certificates.::Dave Cantor"
"Marti Gerrard (Tori Spelling) is a ski champion. In a championship with the dorsal 14 she breaks one of her legs so she will have to stay home for some time. One evening a male voice phones her and tells her to ""take your bikini and go out with me. I'm going to take you to paradise"". She tells him that it's the wrong number but they start talking about several things. That man phones her again soon enough.Marti tells his boyfriend Cliff (Kavan Smith) to stop pestering about her. He is over-jealous. The young male (whose name Marti doesn't know) is Connor Hill (Jason Brookes)-'s voice keeps on calling her specially when he has arguments with his wife Laura Hill (Charlene Fernetz) who also has a lover. Laura lends her sports car to Tony Travis (Garwin Sanford) her lover. First they have an argument about him arriving late to pick her up; on a second occasion she demands of him to give her her car keys back.Marti finds a hidden camera and blames it on Connor. A saleswoman (Linda Ko) tells her who bought the camera because Marti threatens her to go to the police as she had to break in to hide the camera. He put it there to know her looks: Connor admits that he put the camera there. She realises that he's married at this point. Marti wants to put an end to their story. Kirk tries to get romantic with Marti but she rejects her. Cliff also tries to shorten her dry time on the dockyard but Marti rejects his worries and his advances. Although unmarried they are living together but her new love interest seems to keep them even more apart than before.Connor phones Marti. He starts telling her that Laura has a lover Tony Travis but he can't divorce her because they share the business. He is telling Marti his story while Laura is walking on the parking lot. She is attacked and strangled. Luis Valdivia (Dave 'Swautch' Ward) the truck lorry finds out the body. He honks and Connor ends their conversation and hangs up to call the police. Marti overhears the different noises on the phone: the honking the police car bells...Lt. Jim Mahaffey (Michael Tucker) interrogates Connor. He blames it on Tony as he was separated de facto from Laura and he knew she had a lover. The next day a very calm-down Connor calls on Marti to invite her over. At first they talk about the murder: he tells her that it's better if she says nothing. They bade goodbye but on second thoughts Marti wants to go out with him. They go to one of his chalets and they make love there.Marti can't avoid but see the photograph of Rachel an ex-girlfriend whose phtograph Connor has kept. He tells her that Rachel died drown in the sea. She also discovers the photographs which a private detective has made of Laura and Tony Travis. He tells Marti that Tony jogs every morning but not that particular day.Some day later Mahaffey calls on Marti saying that it is impossible to prove that it was actually Connor who was speaking to Marti on the phone although a call was actually made from the home line of the mansion of the Hills. The cop wonders how fitting was for Connor to get the wrong telephone number of a renown sportswoman in the USA as her. He also says that Laura wanted no more of that uncomfortable situation and she was suing him for divorce.At court a man says that he saw Connor but he is not shown as a reliable witness. He insists that it won't be necessary for Marti to testify. She is better and not paying attention to Mahaffey's advice she goes to ski with him.Once there at the room she needs some scissors. She finds two further names Kathy Hewitt (Suzy Joachim) and Ramona Scott (Gaetana Korbin). She phones Kathy but she is not in so Marti leaves a recorded message on her answering machine.At court things look terribly bad for Tony Travis. Attorney Hendricks (Kevin McNulty) says that jogging is practiced alone so nobody saw him at the same time of the murder. He says that he helped a woman with her broken-down car. Hendricks is putting all the blame on Tony Travis. Connor says that everybody thinks that Tony is guilty to a reporter (Norma Jean Wick).Marti interviews Ramona a dyed-blonde quite attractive and lively but a bit vulgar who lives on the poor quarters of the city. Ramona says she has never set eyes on the millionaire Connor Hill. She finds it strange because Connor had her phone number written down and scratched off but Ramona says that she can't figure it out either.D. A. Linda Garcia (Rae Dawn Chong) presents a surprise witness: it's Nancy Swofford (Katya Gardner) who appears at court saying that she saw on TV the judgement and she realised that she was the woman who Tony helped.So Connor has to eventually ask Marti to testify on his behalf. Garcia questions Marti on court. A woman stares at the TV when Marti admits the first words she heard Connor say: ""just pick up your bikini and come with me."" Garcia questions Marti's credibility as she is obviously in love with Connor but she says that their conversation was recorded and that she can produce that recording. Garcia tries to step back as the interrogation goes for an unexpected path but Hendricks insists on presenting the recorded conversation as it was Garcia herself who questioned the witness about it.On the recording everything can be heard: their intimate conversation the honking car the police car noises...Kathy Hewitt phones Marti: she has never set eyes on software tycoon Connor Hill but she had a strange phonecall who told her exactly the same thing that Marti was told the first time by Connor. At that moment we see how the jury declares Connor non-guilty.Mahaffey tells her to be very careful as Connor doesn't need her anymore. Marti visits Nancy Swofford wanting her to admit that she lied. Nancy says that she didn't lie. Marti thinks Nancy was paid. Nancy says that that's not true that Marti is the girlfriend who Connor is using as a toy. But Tony appears at that moment Marti realises that Nancy is Tony's friend. Tony runs after her: he shouts that the accusation led him no other option than to ask her to lie for him. Connor appears at that moment and knocks Tony down. He was following Marti because he was worried about her: according to him Tony was the murderer and he could hurt Marti.Marti knows the videogame geek genius Stuart Ridgeway (Benjamin Ratner) who works with Connor. They are working on a game based on the USA army pilots. Part of the game consists on a male voice guiding the player. Connor invites Marti over to his ski getaway again. There they are about to ski. Just before leaving the cottage she listens to Kathy's weird voicemail telling about the weird phonecall. Connor also gets a call from Stuart about the voice of the videogame but he takes the diverse call. That gives Marti the final clue: he used a diverse call to talk to her while he was strangling Laura. Marti runs wildly around the home looking for his car keys. He wakes up and she runs away. She takes her skis and skis away. Her leg hurts but she has to go on or he will kill her. He can ski quite well too so he gets close to her. She tricks him onto jumping from a cliff. He falls down and dies. She caresses his dead body as she was really in love with him. Marti talks to Mahaffey. He tells her that she can claim the 100000 prize cash. Marti says that she intends to travel on her own and that she will go to somewhere ""she can call paradise""."

Jerry Mulligan is an American ex-GI who stays in post-war Paris to become a painter and falls for the gamine charms of Lise Bouvier. However his paintings come to the attention of Milo Roberts a rich American heiress who is interested in more than just art.::Jwelch5742
Jerry Mulligan an American ex-G.I. decided to stay in Paris where he was stationed during the war to pursue his dream of becoming a painter having a Parisian life which all the famous great artists before him have done. Beyond a group of children in the neighborhood where he lives Jerry considers fellow American Adam Cook who came to Paris to study classical piano his best friend. As Adam studies more than he gets work he is a struggling artist much like Jerry. Adam's Frenchman friend and former professional colleague Henri Baurel who Jerry befriends through Adam is a bit more successful in his art as a renowned singer. Jerry catches the eye of wealthy more mature American Milo Roberts who lives most of the year in Paris when she isn't at home in Baltimore. Although Jerry initially sees through Milo's pretense to her true intentions of she wanting to be his sugar mama - something she has been to other struggling younger artists before - he eventually takes her to her word that she is only interested in helping him get his name known within Paris art circles. Milo quickly comes to see that she may have problems having Jerry all to herself when he is smitten on first sight with an innocent nineteen year old mademoiselle named Lise Bouvier a perfumerie shop girl. Initially considering him too brash and forward Lise eventually falls enough under Jerry's persistent charm to give him a chance. What he does not know is that she is already dating someone else namely Henri who had extolled her virtues to Adam before. On the request of her parents during the war they who were working for the Resistance Lise became Henri's ward for the duration of the war. They only fell in love as Lise became a woman. Lise has to decide if her love is stronger for Jerry than her sense of obligation to Henri who can also give her an exciting future as he wants her to go to the US with him as Mrs. Baurel while he goes on tour. And Jerry has to decide if his love for Lise is stronger than his want to be a famous artist the latter which Milo seems to be able to provide. Lise and Jerry's decisions are with the mutual knowledge that they love each other.::Huggo
"Richard Wagner's last opera has remained controversial since its first performance for its unique and for some unsavory blending of religious and erotic themes and imagery. Based on one of the medieval epic romances of King Arthur and the search for the holy grail (the chalice touched by the lips of Christ at the last supper) it recounts over three long acts how a ""wild child"" unwittingly invades the sacred precincts of the grail fulfilling a prophecy that only such a one can save the grail's protectors from a curse fallen upon them. Interpreters of the work have found everything from mystical revelation to proto-fascist propaganda in it. Hans-Jurgen Syberberg's production doesn't avoid either aspect but tries synthesize them by seeking their roots in the divided soul of Wagner himself. The action unfolds on a craggy landscape which turns out to be a gigantic enlargement of the composer's death mask among deliberately tatty theatrical devices: puppets scale models magic-lantern projections. The eponymous hero is sung by the specified tenor voice (Reiner Goldberg) but mimed on screen by a male and a female performer alternately reflecting what the director takes to be the creator's own sexual conflicts. Syberberg's pacing dictated by the majestic pace of Wagner's score is slow but enlivened by constant subtle shifts in point of view and memorable performances by actress Edith Clever as the villainess/heroine Kundry (sung by Yvonne Minton) orchestra conductor Armin Jordan as the remorseful knight Amfortas (sung by Wolfgang Schoene) and Robert Lloyd (the faithful retainer Gurnemanz).::Roger Downey"

Philip Carey his club foot of which he is extremely self-conscious leaves Paris and his dream of an art career behind after being told he lacks the talent to make it in the business to head home to London to a medical school life at least in order to do something worthwhile for society. Despite saying outwardly that he considers her crass Philip back in London is immediately smitten with a Cockney waitress named Mildred Rogers. Mildred treats him poorly when she does go out with him - he being only one of her suitors - while he has a fantasized view of her in his infatuation. That infatuation leads to other things in his life suffering such as his school work. Her poor treatment of him includes leaving without a care with someone else when she gets a more appealing offer and crawling back to him when she needs his help. Conversely Philip tries to find love with other women only to hurt those women when he can't love them as much as he loves Mildred.

"Flipper Purify (Wesley Snipes) is a successfully married African American man who works at an architectural firm in New York City. One day an Italian American woman named Angela ""Angie"" Tucci (Annabella Sciorra) is hired as a temporary secretary at the place. Flipper complains to his partners Jerry (Tim Robbins) and Leslie (Brad Dourif) about wanting an African American secretary. They tell him that they want ""the best human being for the job.""When Flipper returns to his Harlem home after visiting his best friend Cyrus (Spike Lee) he tells his wife Drew (Lonette McKee) about his promotion. Drew tells him to be prepared if his promotion is declined but Flipper tells her not to worry. Meanwhile Angie returns to her Bensonhurst home and cooks dinner for her father Mike (Frank Vincent) and her two brothers Charlie (David Dundara) and Jimmy (Michael Imperioli). Her boyfriend Paulie Carbone (John Turturro) arrives and takes her out on a date. Paulie is a regular Italian-American man who co-manages a grocery store in his and Angie's neighborhood. While he waits for Angie her brothers antagonize Paulie about his relationship with his sister threatening him with bodily harm if his only intention is to have sex with her. Paulie's able to shake it off and he & Angie leave. One night Flipper and Angie are working late at the firm and they start to have a conversation about cooking. They continue to work late and have dinner in his office and they have sex on a desk. The next day Flipper doesn't speak while walking his daughter to school. Later at the office he tells Jerry and Leslie that he wishes to be made a partner at the firm. After his offer is declined he abruptly quits his job telling his employers that his ideas have made the firm very profitable. One of his bosses Leslie tells Flipper they need ""a little more time"" while Les' partner Jerry reacts angrily to Flipper's resignation saying that his ego is driving his decisions. Later that night at the park Flipper admits his infidelity to Cyrus. Just then Flipper's older brother Gator (Samuel L. Jackson) shows up with his girlfriend Vivian (Halle Berry). He asks Flipper for some money so he can feed his crack habit. Flipper initially refuses but gives in eventually.Meanwhile Angie tells her two girlfriends that she's seeing Flipper shocking them when she tells them he is African American. She then tells them not to tell anybody. But her friends just cannot stop their gossiping and they secretly tell one of Angie's brothers who likewise tells their father Mike.The next evening Flipper and Angela are ignored by the racist staff at a local restaurant. He complains to an African-American waitress (Queen Latifah) about not being served she in turn berates him for dating a white woman. Later the rumors about them surface when Flipper comes home and sees a furious Drew throwing his things out of the second floor window forcing him to move back in with his mother Lucinda (Ruby Dee) and his father the Good Reverend Doctor (Ossie Davis) in nearby Brooklyn. Later that night he confronts Cyrus for betraying his trust. Cyrus admits that he told his wife Vera (Veronica Webb) but he didn't know that she would tell Drew (plus several other people in the neighborhood). Flipper insults Vera for her big mouth and inability to keep a secret which causes a rift in his friendship with Cyrus who demands he apologize to Vera but Flipper refuses. Shortly after Flipper ends his friendship with Cyrus after seeing that although Cyrus does like and support Flipper he will always side with his wife regardless of her actions.The next day Flipper tries to make things up to Drew by bringing her flowers at work which she refuses. The two have a nasty argument and Flipper leaves. Meanwhile Angie ends her relationship with Paulie. His father Lou (Anthony Quinn) finds Paulie in the bathroom and consoles him. When Angie returns home a livid and racist Mike violently beats her for dating a black man and throws her out of the house.Flipper and Angie move in to an apartment together where they subsequently encounter social problems including a failed dinner with Flipper's parents who disapprove of their son dating someone outside his race. These and other racial issues eventually strain relations between the couple. One night things come to a head when the police almost arrest Flipper after receiving a wrongful report from another racist white person that ""a white lady was being attacked"" (this due to somebody apparently having watched them in a compromising position over a car hood from a window since it looked like he was forcing himself on her). Afterword Flipper and Angie get into another huge argument when he tells her that he refuses to have half-blood children with her.When Paulie hears the confession from Angie about her affair with a black man he is heartbroken. This somehow gives him the courage to ask a black female regular customer named Orin Goode (Tyra Ferrell) out on a date. This puts him at odds with his own racist father and his friends whom he gets into a fight with although he winds up hurt himself. Orin turns down Paulie's request to go out on a date. When he pesters her Orin tells him off by saying that her parents have forbidden her from dating a man outside her race and she will not defy her parents out of blind loyalty to them. Paulie finds himself more emotionally hurt and alone then ever.One night a high-on-dope Gator storms into his parents house one night while the Reverend is away demanding money from Lucinda while trashing the house. The Reverend arrives and threatens to shoot him if he doesn't leave. Gator turns to leave but upon hearing the Reverend insult him he turns around and threatens him. The Reverend tells Gator he is better off dead and shoots him in the groin. Gator cries in pain as he slowly dies in his mother's arms. However The Reverend shows a small sign of regret.Eventually due to the great gap created between them two Flipper admits that he was only curious about being with a white woman and he tells Angie that she should accept she was also curious about black men. They break up and he leaves the apartment they were sharing. Angie returns to her father's house where she apologizes for getting into a romance with a man who's color skin is different. Mike awkwardly welcomes Angie back.In the end Flipper is seen having sex with Drew again but she is laughing and crying at the same time. When they finish she sends him off. It is clear that they were obviously not back together and she only called him over for sex with no seemingly immediate solution in regards to it. He kisses his daughter Ming (Veronica Timbers) goodbye and walks out to go home back to his parents house. Then at the turn of the corner a very young black girl asks him to let her do oral sex on him for two dollars. Stunned Flipper embraces her and screams to the heavens: NOOOOOOO!!!!.(It was not clear whether the plot had leaped forward to some years later and this girl was Ming or that he was only shocked to see this teenager whoring herself for drug money.)

"The movie opens with a strong rainstorm on a road. We see a car approaching us. The car stops by a local lodge. A man gets out and runs in soaking wet. This man is Mike Enslin (John Cusack). He walks up to the front desk and starts talking to the elderly couple who run the establishment. They tell him how they've been expecting him. It is explained quickly through their conversation that Mike is an author of cheesy horror tour guide books. He travels from place to place staying at supposedly ""haunted"" places and then writing summaries of them for his books. As he talks with the couple they try and tell him all about the history of the lodge and how a servant of the house once hanged herself and the female head of the house lost all five of her children to tuberculosis in the bed Mike will be staying in. Mike however seems totally perfunctory about these stories. He seems to be very apathetic to the history of the place and clearly feels he knows as much as he needs to. He just wants to stay in the room so he can study it once again like he has done so many other times. Later we see Mike in the attic room that is claimed to be haunted but it seems totally mundane and harmless. As time passes Mike walks around and checks the place out. He even breaks out of equipment which he uses to test for the presence of supernatural forces. It is all to no avail though. The room is a regular room and Mike falls asleep.The next morning Mike wakes up and promptly leaves He heads to a book signing he is scheduled to attend in a small book store. When he arrives he sees a stand setup but no one is there to greet him and there doesn't seem to be anyone there lined up to see him. Mike heads to the counter and tells the man there he is here for his book event. The man at first seems totally oblivious to what Mike is talking about. Mike shows him a pamphlet with his picture on it from the store announcing the event. Then the store guy seems to recall. The clerk at the counter announces the event over the loudspeaker of the store to the sparse number of patrons. However most seem to show little or no interest. Next we see Mike talking about his various books at the ""event"" which is attended by 4 or 5 people. He talks of his various derivative books like ""The 10 Scariest Mansions"" and ""The 10 Scariest Lighthouses"". One of the attendees asks him if his experiences have lead him to believe in ghosts. Mike says all this stuff is fantasy and that nothing in all of his travels has ever been out of the ordinary and would lead to believe in such things as much as he might like to. He sarcastically tells one of the people if he really wants to see a ghost he should head to the ""Haunted Mansion"" in Orlando. As he signs the various horror guide books for the handful in attendance. A young girl walks up to him and places a book before him called ""The Long Road Home"" that he wrote. Mike is astounded that the girl has a copy of this book. It is clear this is not one of his horror books. The girl says her name is Anna and she tells him how she was genuinely touched and moved by the book and how it seemed too authentic especially the part about the relationship between the father and son. She asks him if it really happened. Mike says no. However his expression clearly indicates that is not quite true. He seems flattered by her words but clearly he doesn't want to linger on this point. When she asks him if he is ever going to write another book like it Mike says that period is over now.After the book event Mike heads back to his home base in Los Angeles. While there he goes for some surfing down by the beach. As Mike is surfing he surfaces from the water and sees a plane flying over his head. The plane has a message banner attached to it. As Mike tries to read it he gets distracted and fails to see the huge wave that is headed for him. The wave sends Mike reeling and he eventually washes up on the beach chocking water with a guy asking him if he is alright. Later Mike goes to the post office to pick up his mail. We then see him at a local diner opening up his mail. Most of them are advertisements for more ""supposedly"" haunted locations that the owners want Mike to visit and write about. One of these is a post card that catches Mikes eye. It is a postcard from the Dolphin Hotel in New York. On the back of the postcard is a single warning message: ""DON'T ENTER 1408! Mike examines the room number and writes ""=13"" on the card realizing this is what the sum of the numbers is. ""Clever"" he comments.Next Mike phones his New York publishing office and speaks to his publisher Sam Farrell (Tony Shalhoub). He tells him he plans on making the Room 1408 of the Dolphin the final location for his newest touring book. Sam tells him it sounds like a really cool possibility but asks Mike if he really wants to come back to New York after ""all that happened"". Mike says he is over ""that"" now but its clear that Mike is still deeply affected by something that occurred there. Mike then sets out researching newspaper clippings of the incidents that have transpired with the former occupants of the Dolphins infamous room. He finds one article in particular of the first victim of the room. A wealthy businessman who inexplicably jumped from the window of the room while staying there just 1 week after the hotel opened. Mike then calls the hotel itself and tells them he would like to make a reservation. They say fine but then Mike says he wants room 1408 and they immediately reply that it is unavailable. Mike says he never gave a date. He keeps persisting them in asking when it will be made available but they keep saying it wont and eventually hang up on him. Mike thinks this is some sort of ploy. He speaks to Farrell again and he tells Mike that physically they cannot prevent Mike from renting the room according to the law. If it is available as a hotel they must rent any available room to him according to official operational New York guidelines. Mike says this is great and tells them to go ahead and make the reservation. Farrell asks Mike if he is sure about this given the rooms incredibly sordid and wicked history. Mike says he isn't concerned and prepares to head for the Dolphin.Next we see Mike arriving at the Dolphin Hotel. It isn't at all the sort of creepy and macabre establishment he expects and that most of the places he visits try to be. It looks like a regular hotel. He enters the lobby and finds it quite busy. He approaches the counter and speaks to the woman there. Mike tells her who he is and that he is here to check into Room 1408. However as soon as she enters his information on the computer an alert comes up to immediately notify the manager before letting Mike Enslin check in. She tells him to wait a moment. While he is waiting a hotel lobby bellboy walks over and asks Mike is he can take his bag. Mike says no and the worker politely walks on. Shortly thereafter Mike meets the manager of the hotel Gerald Olin (Samuel L. Jackson). Gerald asks Mike if he can please accompany him back to his office and says he needs to discuss the matter of Mike staying in Room 1408. Mike agrees to this and the two head off.Inside Gerald Olin's office Gerald tries to tell Mike about why he must not stay in Room 1408. He first offers Mike a bottle of some expensive Bourbon on the house as a friendly gesture which Mike takes. He then goes through the rooms gruesome and hideous history and how dozens of people have killed themselves inside the room in all sorts of shocking manners. However as he says all this Mike interrupts him and starts continuing what Gerald was saying about the entire grizzly history of the room. Gerald smiles and says ""I see you've done your homework well"". However he tells Mike he doesn't know the whole story. That in addition to all the suicides there have been over 20 ""natural"" deaths in the room of various circumstances like strokes heart attacks and people who appeared to have literally appeared to have panicked to death. Mike seems startled by this news but remains largely stoic about all of it. He tells Gerald that by staying in 1408 he will write a nice piece of it in his next book and increase the hotels occupancy by 50%. Gerald tells him the hotel usually runs at 90% capacity and doesnt need Mike to promulgate the hotel in one of his books. Gerald tells Mike that the hotel doesn't seek any kind of attention to 1408. That it only fears the room claiming more victims. He continues that no one has ever stayed in room 1408 and lived and in fact no one has lasted more than an hour. He pulls out of a folder of case files of the rooms myriad of victims and tells Mike that in all 56 people have died in there. Gerald says this isn't about publicity or anything else; he just doesnt want to see anyone else die in there. He offers to let Mike see the folder along with staying in Room 1404 which has the same layout if he will just agree not to stay in 1408. Mike says no. Gerald becomes aggravated and throws Mike the folder and says ""Here! Just look at it! Mike examines the folder and peruses the photos of its many unfortunate former occupants as Gerald recounts their stories in particular one of a man who was found stitching his own body parts together. Mike is clearly perturbed by this but still insists on going to 1408. When Gerald asks Mike why he is so adamant about staying in Room 1408 despite all the grizzly stories he has told him Mike responds that he has stayed in countless places over the years where slaughters have occurred and he remains unscathed. Gerald finally relents and takes Mike to get the key for 1408. It is a regular old style brass key. Mike asks why and Gerald tells him that no electronic cards will work with the room for some reason. Mike jokes and says ""What the phantoms don't like modern innovations? Gerald tells him he never said anything about a phantom or a ghost or any such thing. He leans in towards Mike and says ""It's an evil fucking room!We next see Mike and Gerald on the elevator up to the 14th floor. Mike inquires about how the room is maintained being as haunted as it is. Gerald tells him that once a month he and the hotel staff go up to the room in a special visit to change the bulbs and sheets among other things. He says they always go in groups and the door remains open at all times. He tells Mike they treat the room like its a biological hazard zone. However he says once they were cleaning up 1408 and a maid wandered into the bathroom and the door of it closed on her. Gerald says the maid was only in there for less than a minute. Mike says ""Let me guess she died? Gerald says ""No she went blind! He says she poked her own eyes out from sheer madness laughing as they pulled her out. Mike is clearly distressed by all Gerald has told him but when the elevator stops Mike gets off. Gerald says this is as far as he goes and gives Mike one final warning to please not go to 1408. Mike just continues on and the elevator door closes. Mike moves down the hallway of the 14th floor. At first it seems normal with a maid passing by and a few hotel guests entering rooms. However something seems eerily unsettling. Mike continues to 1408 and opens the door with the key. Initially he finds the experience totally anti-climactic. The room looks totally banal and mundane. Just like any regular modern hotel room. He walks in and shuts the door.Initially Mike starts to get used to his surroundings. He checks out the room but there doesn't seem to be anything unusual. It has all the usual amenities of a typical hotel room including a copy of The Bible. Mike lays down on the bed and proceeds to make sardonically mocking comments into a voice recorder he brought with him about how much a joke it is that people speak with such fear of this room. As time passes by Mike gets up goes to the two windows of 1408 to look out. As Mike looks out the window he suddenly hears some weird noise of movement behind him. As Mike turns around he suddenly sees two chocolates laid on his pillow from out of nowhere. He goes into the bathroom and sees the toilet paper has been replaced Mike laughs and thinks this is some ruse by the hotel staff to try and scare him. He says ""Lovely! I have the ghost who does turn down service in here. Mike thinks whoever did the changes must still be in the room but despite looking everywhere he cannot find anyone. A series of bizarre but trivial events starts occurring afterward. Noises flashes and other weird happenings seem to be going on however nothing that cannot be easily explained. Then the heat in the room starts getting out of control. Mike is convinced this is all the doing of the hotel staff to make him leave the room. Mike calls the hotel operator to complain. He demands they send someone to fix it. The operator agrees. Mike seems surprised with how easily she complies with his demands given the fact he think the hotel staff is trying to antagonize him. After a little bit a mechanic arrives at the door Mike tries to open the door but it is stuck. After pulling on it with great force it finally opens sending Mike to the floor. He sees the mechanic at the door and tells him to come in and fix the thermostat but the man refuses saying there is no way he is entering 1408. Mike asks how he is supposed to fix the temperature. The guy tells him he can talk him through it and just has Mike tap on a switch in the box. The cooling comes back on. Mike thanks him but by the time he turns around to look at him he is already gone and the door closed.Mike goes back to relaxing in the room just as he drinks Bourbon a little the clock radio turns on itself playing ""We've Only Just Begun"" by The Carpenters freaking him out. The clock in the room he notices has even begun a countdown from 60 minutes. Initially this doesn't bother Mike much but as the events continue he becomes more and more terrified. Mike hears a high-pitch tingling and becomes deaf temporarily. His hand is crushed by the window then he went to the bathroom to wash the wounds but suddenly the faucet runs from cool to hot water. Mike tries to close the faucet with a towel but it fails then he kicks the sink stopping the faucet. Back to the room to put a bandage in a wounded hand then the clock radio again turns itself on playing the same song. Mike quickly pulls the radio disconnecting the cord but its clock still counting down. The telephone rings and Mike picks up. The woman operator he spoke to earlier picks up again. Mike is livid about what has been happening but the operator is different now rude and almost mocking telling Mike to calm down and not speak to her in such a harsh tone of voice. She tells Mike she will put the manager on but Mike waits and the manager never comes.Mike hangs up the phone and grabs his stuff and then makes a run for the door. However just as he opens the door the key breaks. He then tries to unlock the door with the knife and it unlocks but the door knob breaks the door is now locked and no matter how many times Mike pulls and bangs on it it will not open. Mike goes back over to the bed and sees a spectre of an old man (who looks like the same man who was the first one to commit suicide in the room) emerge from the wall the ghostly spectre goes over towards the window and jumps out. Then another female ghostly spectre appears and jumps out of the other window. Mike goes over to the window and looks out. Across the street he can see a man sitting in a building through a window on the other side of the street. Mike tries to signal and scream to the man. The man across the street gets up and takes a look at Mike. Mike keeps signalling to him and sees the man across the street signalling back but eventually he realizes this person across the street is just mimicking his own actions. Mike cannot understand what is going on. He takes the lamp he has been holding in his hand trying to signal the other man and holds it up to his face. When he does so the man across the street does the same and Mike sees the man across the street is actually him. He then sees a figure with a knife approaching the mirror version of him across the street from behind. Mike turns around and is attacked by the same hideous figure that eventually vanishes. Mike picks up the lamp and tries to throw it out the window towards the ground to try and get the attention of the people and cars he can see passing below but as he drops it the lamp just vanishes. Mike tries to go back towards the door but it still wont open. He now looks over at the lampshade of the lamp he just dropped out the window. It still has light coming out of it despite there being no lamp.Mike is now convinced he must be hallucinating. He looks over at the bottle of Bourbon that Gerald gave him and one of the chocolates left on his bed that he ate. He realizes these could've been used to drug him. Suddenly the TV in his room turns on. A old scene from his life comes on the TV. He sees himself playing with his wife Lily Enslin (Mary McCormack) and their daughter Katie (Jasmine Jessica Anthony). As Mike watches this old memory he comes visibly morose and distraught. He puts his hand up to the TV but the scene vanishes. Mike hears more of the commotion from the next room over he had heard earlier. He hears a baby crying he knocks on the wall and asks the woman he assumes must be with the baby to help him but no one responds. Instead the baby's crying gets progressively louder and louder until it becomes absolutely deafening. Mike falls to the floor and throws a chair at the wall and the noise finally dissipates. Mike now realizes he must escape.He goes back over to the window. All the while Mike has been saying comments into a voice recorder he brought with him to document his stay in 1408. He makes one comment into the voice recorder as he prepares to go out the window that if something were to happen to him he would want anyone who found the recorder to know it was because he slipped and fell and it was an accident. It was not that the room drove him to kill himself. Mike looks the hotel's floor plan of the 14th floor for escape plan. Mike goes out of the window and gets on the ledge. He figures he can make his way across to the window of the next room over. However as Mike keeps going further and further away he wonders how much further it must be. Mike then looks down the ledge but he cannot see any other windows except room 1408. Mike realizes he cannot go further and makes his way back to the window he came from but as he tries to go back in the ghost of the woman who jumped before startles him. She then jumps again and as Mike watches her fall she vanishes before hitting the ground.Mike finally goes back to the room and he sees the floor plan has changed showing the only room 1408 is in the middle of the building. He also sees another scene from his past. This time part of the room next to him turns into a hospital room and we see Mike consoling his wife Lilly about the current status of their daughters health. He tells her everything will be alright. Sitting next to them in a hospital bed is Katie who can hear what they are saying and is clearly concerned. Next the walls start to bleed. Mike tries to calm himself by saying that this must all be a nightmare but he wonders why he cannot wake up. He tries to shock himself out of his dream by looking out of the window as he does the rooms elevation seems to rise dramatically and Mike falls back in sheer fright. Eventually this all culminates in the room becoming like a whirlwind overwhelming with paranormal activity. When Mike finally recovers from this disorienting event he finds the room around has physically changed appearance. The windows are now covered over in a white preventing him from looking out. The entire room is now bathed in a powerful and ominous white light. The rooms wallpaper has changed to one of white flowers and everything else seems to have been modified in a peculiar way. The temperature has also dropped dramatically.Mike then sees that another one of the sections of the room has become another scene from his past. He sees an old man sitting in a chair in what looks like a mental home. This time Mike walks up to the man and talks to him. The man complains about why he is here. Mike realizes this man is his father. His father smiles and tells Mike that soon Mike will be driven insane like him. Mike now realizes he must try and contact someone on the outside. Previously he had tried his cell phone but he could not get a signal. Now he tries the wireless connection on his laptop. By some miracle he is able to get through. He manages to get a video signal through to his wife Lilly. Lilly is astounded to see Mike and wants to know why after all this time he has finally contacted her. Mike tells her he cannot explain. What is going on but she must help him. He begs her to send the police to where he is. He tells her he is in New York at the Dolphin Hotel. Lilly is surprised he is back in New York which is also where she is. She keeps asking Mike why he hasn't been in communication in so long but Mike just tells her to please send the police to where he is. She seems baffled as to why but Mike begs her to just do it. Suddenly the sprinkler system cuts on and short circuits Mike's laptop breaking their conversation. Mike is furious and doesn't even know if his wife got the message. Mike looks back over at the clock to see it is still ticking down Mike realizes again he must try to escape.He goes over to the room's door. Mike had previously seen a air duct above the room. He hopes he can crawl through the ducts to get out. Mike manages to climb up and get into the ducts. As he begins moving through the air ducts he can see more scenes from his life as he passes the air ducts of the rooms below including one of his wife tending to his daughter as a baby. Mike keeps trying to go on but suddenly he finds himself pursued by a grotesque looking old man. The old man starts crawling after Mike and keeps grabbing on to him. Finally Mike kicks the old mans face shattering it. Mike finally falls back down the air duct to Room 1408. He finds the temperature has dropped yet again and the room is now completely covered in snow. Mike walks back over to the floor plan and sees it has now changed. It only shows 1408 and nothing but blackness around it. Mike looks through the keyhole and sees just a wall.Mike tries to burn the various articles in the room to try and keep warm. As he does he witnesses more scenes from his past. He sees a scene of his sick daughter back in the hospital with his wife. They are trying to tell Katie that everything will be alright and that she doesnt have to worry about dying. Mike tries his best to keep her spirits up but it is obvious he has real doubts and fears. Finally we see Mike and Lilly in their home bereaved and commiserating over their daughters death. Mike is angry at his wife for his feeling that she ""Filled Katie's head with fantasies of a heaven instead of willing her to fight! He clearly has lost all his faith and is consumed with despair. Mike then sees a vision in the wall. It is Gerald Olin back in his office... Gerald begins talking to Mike. Mike is furious at him but Gerald says he gave Mike every chance to pass on staying in 1408. He tells Mike that he should not have been so skeptical and doubtful of paranormal activity and ghosts in his books and appearances all those years. He says there is a reason why people believe in this sort of thing for the glimmer of hope that there really is something beyond death. Mike tries to reach for Gerald to hit him but he just finds himself punching a wall.Mike is finally ready to give up when he hears his wife on his laptop again contacting him. He runs over to it and tells her if she sent the police to 1408. His wife says the police are in 1408 and it is empty. Mike now realizes the full power of 1408. The room has now transported him into some kind of separate dimension from the reality he has in. Mike tries to tell his wife he is done for and that he is going to die. His wife says Mike is crazy and that she is going to come down there to him. Mike then pleads with her not to do this but suddenly he realizes she is not hearing him. Then Mike sees a new window on his laptop open up. This time the video image is of him. The new image of Mike begins talking to his wife telling her to come down to 1408 and please join him. Mike begins screaming to the video of his wife on the laptop but to no avail. She can only hear the words of the impostor on the laptop. After she logs off the false Mike looks directly at the real Mike and smiles and then winks. Mike now realizes its not just his life in peril. He screams in utter rage. The rooms paranormal activity reaches its pinnacle. The entire room starts ""coming alive"" even the pictures on the wall. One of the pictures a scene of a ship in a violent storm begins pouring water into the room. Soon the entire room is gone and Mike is trapped underwater above him though he sees a light being emitted from the surface. As Mike swims towards it he comes up and realizes he is no longer in 1408. He is back on the beach from the beginning of the film. He looks up and sees the plane from earlier flying overhead and this time he can read the message on it it says to get great life insurance call XXX-1408. Mike eventually finds himself back on the beach from before where he washed up.Mike then comes to in a hospital in LA. He sees his wife Lilly sitting next to him. He asks her if he is in NY but she tells him he is in LA and that he never went to NY. He explains to his wife that had a vivid dream of going to NY and staying in Room 1408 at the Dolphin Hotel. His wife says she has never heard of it. We then see the two of them in a restaurant and his wife is telling Mike how the dream must've been a metaphor he concocted based on the events of his life. Mike seems composed but he suddenly sees a waitress who looks exactly like the suicidal ghost from 1408. Mike becomes flustered but then he looks back over and sees it is not that woman. Mikes wife then suggest he write about the experience. We then see Mike researching the same stories from before of the victims of 1408 but this time they are different and the victims are unrelated and didn't die in 1408. We then see Mike writing about the experience of 1408 on his computer and how it was a hellish dream he built in his mind. Finally Mike brings his completed manuscript of the 1408 story to the post office to mail it to the NY office but as he gets to the counter he suddenly notices the man at the counter is not the usual guy It is the bellboy he met earlier at the Dolphin Mike turns around and sees some guys working on the wall behind him but they too are workers from the Dolphin hotel. Suddenly they all begin tearing down the walls of the post office and behind them emerges Room 1408. Mike now realizes the nightmare is going to begin again anew.Mike is back in 1408 - is in ruins - but he cannot believe it. He keeps telling himself ""I WAS OUT! Mike looks back at the clock. It is still ticking down. Eventually Mikes daughter appears before him. Mike doesnt believe this is the real Katie. She asks him ""Don't you love me anymore?"" Mike falls to his knees and grabs Katie in his arms. He tells Katie he loves her and they will be together forever. However suddenly Mike feels Katie go limp. He looks at Katie only to find her slumped dead in his arms. Mike begins to weep uncontrollably and falls to the floor. ""You cant take her from me twice"" he explains. The clock radio - still intact - turns itself on playing the same song. The body of his daughter crumbles before him into dust. Mike becomes furious and smashes anything in a room.
Mike watches the last few moments of the hour pass on the clock.When the clock is over Mike arises back in Room 1408 - back in normal. The clock has reset and has begun ticking back down from 60 minutes. We see Mike sitting at a chair answering a ringing phone. He picks it up and asks ""Why don't you just kill me? We then hear the same annoying and rude woman hotel operator from before ""because all our guests enjoy free will sir! She tells him ""You can either repeat this hour over and over forever or you can take advantage of our express checkout! Mike then looks over to see a noose dangling above the bed. Mike sees himself disappears in a mirror and then he sees the two graves his daughter's grave and Mike's grave to be burried. Then in a mirror Mike sees himself hanging through the mirror's image. This doesn't freak him out much. Mike goes back to the desk and picks up a receiver. The operator says ""Are you ready to checkout?"" His answer is no and he hangs up the phone. The telephone rings and he answer it. The operator says ""Your wife will be here soon and I will be sure to send her right up. Just remember there is no escape! Mike tells the operator that the room will not have her. He then says that if he is going down then he is going to be sure that Room 1408 joins him. Mike picks up the bottle of Bourbon from before which is now full again and puts a string into it. He lights the string turning it into a Molotov cocktail and then throws it at the wall. The room begins to erupt in flames. Some ways away we see Mikes wife Lilly in a cab near The Dolphin. She asks what is going on at the hotel as something is clearly awry. She jumps out of the cab and runs to the hotel and sees the fire. Guests are storming out of the hotel and into the streets. Lilly runs up to the fireman and begs them to help her husband. Meanwhile we see Mike back in 1408 smiling and laughing knowing he has beat the room even if this means his death. He crawls under a table as the room is engulfed in flames around him. Mike thinks this is it but then the fireman breaks through the door and pulls him out. Outside the room in the hallway Mike tells them not to go in there because its cursed. They just ignore him figuring he is delirious from the trauma. As the fireman drag him out we see Gerald back in his office saying ""Well done Mr. Enslin."".Later Mike awakens again in a hospital to find Lilly again at his side. Mike explains to her what happened and how he knows that all he has written about all these years and dismissed is actually real. His wife seems skeptical and believes Mike may be delusional from the experience of all that happened. Eventually we see Mike and Lilly back together in their home. Mike is going through his old things in boxes. Lilly finds Mike's stuff he brought back with him from the Dolphin Hotel. Lilly says they should just throw it out since it stinks and it brings back bad memories"". Mike grabs them and says no telling her that ""bad memories are not to be forgotten they are meant to be lived with"". Lilly now realizes Mike is ready to move beyond his daughters death though she is still doubtful of the 1408 haunting. In the things Mike finds the recorder he had with him in 1408 that he occasionally used to comment on the events in the room. Mike realizes he had the recorder on longer than he thought. He fast forwards to the end of the tape. Mike hears the part where is talking to his daughter as Lilly listens too. Suddenly they both hear Katie on the tape. Mike and Lilly are both bewildered as they realize 1408 is very real.****************************************************************************************************************
Alternative (Original) endingDirector Mikael Håfström has stated that the ending for 1408 was re-shot because test audiences felt that the original ending was too much of a ""downer"". The original ending available on the two-disc collector's edition sees the back draft engulfing the room as Enslin hides under the table happy to see the room destroyed as he dies. During Enslin's funeral Olin approaches Lily and Enslin's agent where he unsuccessfully attempts to give her a box of Enslin's possessions including the tape rresecorder. Before being cut-off Olin claims that the room was successfully destroyed and that it will no longer harm anyone ever again hence why he claims ""Enslin did not die in vain"". Going back to his car Olin listens to the recording in his car becoming visibly upset when he hears Katie's voice on the tape. He looks in the car mirror and imagines seeing a glimpse of Enslin's burnt corpse in the backseat. Having heard and seen enough Olin places the tape recorder back in the box and drives off.The film ends at the gutted room with an apparition of Enslin looking out the window and smoking a cigarette. He hears his daughter calling his name and disappears as he walks towards the room's door. A sound of a door closing is heard and the screen blacks out."

"Set in a British independent boys boarding school in the late 1960s (most of the scenes were filmed at Cheltenham College in Gloucestershire with the remainder at Uppingham School in Rutland and Aldenham School in Hertfordshire England UK). Mick Travis (Malcolm McDowell) is one of three non-conformist boys among the returning class. They are watched and persecuted by the ""Whips"" senior boys given authority as 'prefects' over juniors. The prefects are entitled to the services of ""Scum"" who are first-year boys assigned to run errands make tea and generally act as unpaid servants. This refers to the old tradition of ""fagging"" which still persisted in many British independent boys' schools.The early part of the film shows scenes in the school as the pupils return at the start of a new term. Mick Travis the protagonist arrives with a suitcase on his shoulder wearing a black Derby hat with a black scarf across his face to hide his moustache. Stephans comments ""God it's Guy Fawkes back again"" hinting at the conclusion of the film. Rowntree (Robert Swann) is the Head Whip and he revels in his power ordering the junior boys to ""Run! Run in the corridor!""After the first evening meal the Whips conduct some of the more mundane business of the school signing up boys for ""Confirmation class"" and ""VD clinic"". Each boy has to lower his pants so the school nurse can inspect his genitals.These early scenes show the school's customs and traditions. The Headmaster (Peter Jeffrey) is somewhat remote from the boys and the House Masters. Mr. Kemp (Arthur Lowe) the House Master to Mick's dorm is told ""I'll have to get back to you on that"" when he brings things to the Headmaster's attention. Kemp himself is easily manipulated by the Whips into giving them a free hand in enforcing discipline. Some of the staff are shown as suffering from various perversions. For example the school chaplain (Geoffrey Chater) who is also the geometry master enjoys grasping the boys and hurting them during class. At bedtime Mr. Kemp sings a hymn as his wife (Mary MacLeod) accompanies him on the recorder; the matron (Mona Washbourne) overhearing is driven to near orgasm. Mrs. Kemp herself enjoys walking naked through the boys' dormitory and washroom while fondling soap towels and other objects the boys have carelessly strewn about.One day having sneaked off campus and into the nearby town (an act strictly forbidden by house rules) Mick steals a motorbike from a showroom and has an affair with a local waitress. Meanwhile Wallace finds adolescent romance with Bobby Philips a junior boy whom he takes to bed. They indulge in self-inflicted ordeals such as seeing how long they can hold a plastic bag over their faces.As the film progresses it concentrates on Mick's group and their clashes with the school authorities. Mick and his friends are subject to punishments and eventually they are sentenced to corporal punishment in the form of a severe ""beating"" (i.e. a caning) by the Whips. The caning is administered by Rowntree in the gym with a long run-up. The three boys are left with bleeding buttocks. Mick's punishment is especially brutal (10 strokes) yet tradition demands that he shake hands when it is over and say ""Thank you"".(Note: scenes are shot through with surreal elements such as some scenes being shot in black and white. This was not for dramatic emphasis as people presumed but simply because the huge windows at the college gave off obstructing light that affected the camera lenses. Another explanation given later by Lindsay Anderson is simply that the production was running out of money.)A few days later during a paramilitary exercise training in the nearby woods Mick and his friends play a practical joke on the Whips by planting a bomb containing paint which they detonate and humiliate the Whips and the supervisors of the military exercise. As a result Mick and his friends are punished by being forced to clean up the church basement for the weekend. During the cleaning Mick and his group find a large cache of various weapons dating back to the second world war (rifles heavy machine guns sub-machine guns pistols grenades and even mortar tubes with live rounds). Mick decides to use this to get revenge against the establishment for their misfortune. At the climax in a surreal sequence on Founders' Day when parents are visiting the school Mick and his group start a fire under the hall smoke out the parents staff and boys and open fire on them from a rooftop. Led by the visiting General who was giving the speech the staff and boys break open the Combined Cadet Force armoury and fire back.The Headmaster tries to stop the firefight and calls for peace. Mick's girl who is on the roof with them produces a Webley Revolver from her belt and shoots the Headmaster through the forehead in cold blood. As the battle continues the camera closes in on Mick's face as he defiantly keeps firing ending the film with a fade-out and an echo of gunfire with the film's title ""if...."" emblazoned in red on the screen.

Chiyo was the second daughter of a poor fisherman in Yoroido and a curiosity in her village - her eyes were blue (in the novel they were blue-grey). Ser father was old and her mother terminally ill; thus the parents were persuaded to sell their daughters for a more secured life. Chiyo and sister Satsu were promptly sent to Gion(geisha district) right away. Auntie decides to keep her in the Nitta Okiya but rejects her sister. Satsu is then sent to a common brothel in the Miyagawa-Cho district to become a prostitute.Chiyo spent her first few years in the okiya working as a maid and planning her escape. Hatsumomo the star of the okiya and one of the most beautiful and popular geishas at the time sensed that she was going to be a threat and set out to eliminate her. She and Korin forced Chiyo to ruin a kimono(which belonged to Hatsumomo's most hated rival in Gion Mameha). The next day Auntie half-heartedly beat her as punishment for the ruined kimono since she didn't want Mother or Granny getting their hands on her. She also warns her against trusting Hatsumomo because she'll ruin her in a second. As a reward for ruining Mameha's kimono Hatsumomo finally told her that her sister is in the Miyagawa-Cho district under the brother home Tatsuyo and arranged for them to meet. The sisters decided that Chiyo would sneak out of the okiya by walking on top of the neighbouring roofs meet up with Satsu and then they would escape together. Her attempt failed as she fell off one of the roofs and her sister went on without her. Auntie was infuriated at Chiyo for not heeding her warning to keep clear. While she was recovering from her injuries she received a letter informing her that both of her parents have died. Now she is all alone in the world.Mother (the madam) was furious with Chiyo's rebellious behaviour and decided not to raise her as a geisha but as a maid. On a maid wage she will never be able to pay off her contract and leave the okiya. Chiyo settled uneasily into her doomed life while watching her friend and fellow maid Pumpkin get elevated to being an apprentice geisha and all her work as a maid is transferred to her. Upon learning that Chiyo will remain Mother's slave for all time Hatsumomo rejoiced at the prospect and set out to make her life even more miserable than before.One day while a 12-year-old Chiyo was out on an errand her concerns for her future remaining as a maid under Mother overwhelmed her and she started to cry. A man stopped to talk to her and accompanied her for some shaved ice. He bought her flavoured ice and gave her two coins to cheer her up. Watching the Chairman walk away with two geishas Chiyo decided that she would become a geisha at any cost just so that she can be with him. She spent the coins on making her wish and kept the Chairman's handkerchief.In the winter of 1935 Chiyo is 15 and she's helping Pumpkin get ready for her debut as an apprentice geisha under Hatsumomo's tutelage. After they left she noticed that her friend forgot her shamisen and ran out of the Nitta Okiya to the back of Mizuki Teahouse(Hatsumomo's prime) and gave the mistress there her friend's shamisen. A few days later the okiya got a surprise visit from the famed geisha Mameha who offered irresistable conditions to take Chiyo as her apprentice geisha. Mother's greed got the better of her and Chiyo became Sayuri. During her training Sayuri showed considerable talents and Mother began to consider adopting her instead of Pumpkin as her daughter to inherit the okiya. This further intensified the feud between Hatsumomo and Mameha.Time was drawing close to the bidding for Sayuri's mizuage (the first night) but with Hatsumomo's schemes Mameha was no where close to finding enough potential dannas (patrons) to start a proper bidding. She decided to try the impossible - Nobu a rich man disfigured by chemical accident and disliked geishas. Miraculouslyhe fell in love with Sayuri; and Sayuri with his best friend - the Chairman.Sayuri's mizuage made history as the highest bid to date and she became the IT geisha. Mother adopted her kicked Hatsumomo out for trying to destroy her career by causing the fire and Pumpkin was left homeless to fend for herself. But Sayuri's glory was cut short by World War II. As all geishas were gathered up and shipped to factories as workers she and Mameha went into hiding with the Chairman's help.After the war Mameha and Sayuri found it hard to survive as genuine geishas. The American soldiers are the big spender now and they prefer common prostitutes to geishas. Pumpkin's fell from grace now turned out to be a blessing.The Chairman hired Sayuri Mameha and Pumpkin for a trip so that they could entertain an American colonel named Derricks his associates and turn them into his business partners. Sayuri realised that she would have to get either Nobu or Col. Derricks to become her danna to survive. But meeting the Chairman again after the war proofed to be too strong a temptation she decided to throw everything away and follow her heart for once. In her room Mameha warned Sayuri against doing that because it's disrespectful to Nobu and she could ruin her career for that mistake. She told he to accept him as her danna because he saved her life and she owed a great debt. She mentions that Hatsumomo made the mistake of following her heart once by eloping with Koichi and destroyed her chances to have a danna. Sayuri refuses to listen to Mameha which proved to be her undoing.She arranged for the general to meet her in a shack and told Pumpkin to bring Nobu so that both can be disappointed at her. She took this long-awaited chance and had her revenge - she brought the Chairman. When Sayuri demanded an answer from her friend. Pumpkin vehemently out of anger (cool but still upset in the movie) told her she took away her rightful place as Mother's daughter and heir of the Nitta Okiya. A heart-broken Sayuri threw away the cherished handkerchief and gave in to her fate.Just when she thought she had lost favour with Nobu Mother got a booking request from him. Disillusioned and settling for security Sayuri arrived prepared to get back in Nobu's favour only to find that the booking was made by the Chairman.Now that his best friend is no longer interested in Sayuri the Chairman can finally show his feelings and have his Chiyo back - it was him who sent Mameha to find the girl with blue eyes and ensure that she was taken care of and reunited with him.......

A young nine year old girl Chiyo lives in a rather poor fishing village Yoroido on Japan's coast. Along with her older sister Satsu she is sent to the geisha (Japanese for artisan) district called Gion. Split from the only family she has left Chiyo is sent to the Nitta Okiya while her sister is transported else where and becomes less of a role. And Okiya is a house (sort of a compound) where a geisha lives and is taken care of. Here at the Nitta Okiya Chiyo meets another girl about her age nicknamed Pumpkin. Together Pumpkin and Chiyo struggle through the daily life of being treated as nothing more than slaves to the resident geisha Hatsumomo. Hatsumomo the story's resident villain tries her hardest to make Chiyo's life as miserable as possible. On one particular occasion Chiyo feeling so depressed collapses on a bridge in tears over her life's woes. Much to her surprise a high society passer by stops to question why she is so sad. Here little Chiyo meets The Chairman for the first time. He shows her kindness in a world which has been naught but cruel to her and from that point on Chiyo makes it her goal to break free from the social class she was born into and become a geisha worthy of The Chairman. After much work and hardship Chiyo is allowed to attend school where young girls are taught all the important practices associated with the life of a geisha. She learns tea ceremony how to play the shamisen (like a little banjo or acoustic guitar) as well as quite possibly the most important act how to dance. The word geisha in Japanese is derived from a term referring to art so a geisha is like an artisan or an artist. After some more altercations with Hatsumomo Chiyo is taken under the wing of one of Gion's most popular geisha Mameha. Mameha also happens to be Hatsumomo's arch-rival as a geisha. Mameha takes a long time to introduce Chiyo as her apprentice however once she does she is already blessed with fame for being associated with someone of Mameha's class. Here is the part of the story where Chiyo's name changes to Sayuri (her geisha name). Mameha introduces Sayuri is many numerous figures in Gion life and it come to a point where men are fighting for the highest bid on Sayuri's mizuage. All this time Sayuri is struggling with the common life lessons learned when one is growing up into a young woman. It is very much a coming of age story. Through all trials of adversity Sayuri faces her one goal is always to see The Chairman again. Finally the day comes when she is invited along with Mameha to a party at a teahouse at which The Chairman is attending. For the next couple of weeks she attends multiple parties which the chairman attend all the while seemingly coming closer to achieving her goal. Tension has been growing concerning World War II and the society in Gion is beginning to feel the effects of war. Rations are set up and many part of the giesha district have begun to close. Geisha are fleeing to other parts of the country hoping to avoid getting caught in an attack. Sayuri and all of her friends are split apart until after the war and once everyone returns to Gion it is realized the effects of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. All geisha who fled to these cities obviously died and it is a loss greatly felt by the community. Sayuri desperately attempts to attain the love of the Chairman and the climax of the story is whether or not she does meet her goal.::Ai is Baka

The men wile away their time with some engaging in dangerous stunts while others woo some of the local lasses. The phony war comes to an end in April 1940 and the Battle of Britain begins. By September that year few of them are left and despite their success few see themselves as heroes.::garykmcd

Radha's mother asks her if she understands. Radha says no.In the present Sita (Nandita Das) stands with a bunch of visitors in front of a tour guide looking at the Taj Mahal. The tour guide explains how Shah Jahan's wife made him promise to build this monument as a symbol of their love. Sita's husband Jatin (Javed Jaffrey) joins the group.

Mundu talks about the program he has on the TV wherein the goddess Sita's purity is being tested.Jatin tells Ashok that he felt he had no choice in marrying Sita due to Ashok's nagging. Jatin accuses Ashok of doing everything he does for Swamiji. Ashok hits Jatin. A few moments later Ashok tells Radha to forgive him saying to her ""My choices have made life difficult for you."" Radha responds ""What is there to forgive?""That night Jatin and Sita have sex for the first time - a loveless mechanical act. Jatin lies back and goes to sleep. Sita cleans her blood off of the bed's sheet.The next day or so Jatin and Sita talk. He suggests that she find something to do. They argue. Sita tells him that he should not leave his picture of Julie laying around.The family is about to clean up downstairs. Ashok gives Radha and Jatin some money. Jatin asks how long Ashok will support Swamiji. Ashok says Swamiji doesn't ask for money; he gives to the swami willingly.That night Ashok lies in a bed next to Radha testing himself to see if he will be tempted by her sexually. She gets up and asks him if she could have children would he need her? He says probably not.

Ashok and Swamiji watch them.Radha and Sita kiss outside on the roof of the building. Ashok calls Radha and after awhile she comes to him. He asks her ""Why didn't you come?""

Mundu takes one of the porno movies upstairs to jerk off to while Biji watches in horror. Radha walks in and catches him. She slaps him asking him where he got the movie. He says that Jatin rents them to special customers. She tells him to get out and he says that the ""hanky panky"" between her and Sita isn't good for the family name.Radha asks Ashok to get rid of Mundu but Ashok insists that he stays. On the roof she and Sita meet and talk. Sita says that even if Mundu mentions what he's seen no one will believe him. Radha admits she is not so different from Mundu in his selfishness.Jatin recites some of Swamiji's words to Sita in their room. He tells her that he cannot stop seeing Julie mentioning some of Julie's good traits. He says Sita can leave him but that life can be difficult for a divorced woman. The other option he says is for Sita to have a baby with him. She calls him a ""pompous fool."" They slap each other. He says he likes her new feistiness and kisses her on the mouth. She looks at him with displeasure so he knocks her down and leaves.On the roof Radha sees a bruise on Sita's face and asks her if it hurts. Sita says she's treated ""like a household pet"" and ""that's what hurts."" The women hug each other.In the restaurant later Ashok carries Biji upstairs leaving Radha with a singing Mundu. Radha's gaze is contemptuous. Jatin announces to everyone that he won't be back tonight and leaves. Mundu sits down and stares at a photo of Biji Jatin Radha and Sita with everyone crossed out except for Radha who has a heart drawn around her head.Alone together Radha tells Sita that a long time ago Ashok took a vow of celibacy. She explains what he does with her to prove he's beyond temptation and therefore closer to God. Radha tells her that he's done this for 13 years. Radha and Sita hug each other. Mundu listens at the door outside. Sita says they're not going to stay there any longer.Mundu pulls Ashok away from Swamiji but then says nothing. Later the two men go upstairs to the house.

He slams open the door startling them and catching them in the act. He walks away then exits the house.The women decide to leave with Sita saying that there's no word in their language for what they are.

Downstairs Ashok freaks out thinking about his wife in intimacy with Sita.Ashok goes to Radha in the kitchen and tells her to come to the bedroom so that he can test himself again. She refuses saying that she's going to leave him. Ashok says that what he saw in their bedroom is a sin in the eyes of God and man. She openly repudiates his thinking that desire is wrong. Ashok snaps throwing himself upon her. She rejects his touch. He says ""Touch my feet"" then pushes her aside. Her sari catches fire on the stove.Ashok stares at Radha for a moment then picks up Biji and goes to the door.Back at the field from the prologue young Radha closes her eyes and then says she can see the ocean.At the agreed-upon meeting place Sita stands in the rain.

Two women who are abandoned by their husbands find love and solace in each other.::IDream
Ashok runs a family business that sells takeout food that also has a video rental store at the side. Ashok's extended family includes his wife Radha his brother Jatin their ailing mother Biji and their manservant Mundu all living under the same roof. Jatin at the insistence of Ashok and their mother Biji agrees to marry the beautiful Sita in an arranged marriage although he is actually in love with Julie a Chinese-Indian. At first glance you see a happy middle-class family going through the normal paces of everyday life. However as the layers are slowly peeled back we find a simmering cauldron of discontent within the family with almost every family member living a lie. Both marriages in the family turn out to be emotionally empty without love or passion. While Ashok is an ascetic who has taken a vow of celibacy Jatin is a handsome ladies' man who is still openly seeing Julie even after his marriage to Sita. Ashok has pledged his total devotion to a religious holy man a swami in order to purge his life of worldly desires and temptations. Radha bound by her sense of duty to her husband agrees to go along with his wishes. As you can imagine with both husbands ignoring their spouses' emotional and sexual needs (albeit with reasons that are totally opposite from each other) it is only a matter of time before Radha and Sita look to one another for comfort and to satisfy their own passions. In this environment it is only natural that Sita and Radha become fast friends and in time much more than that. But their love is not without its share of painful obstacles.::Hariharan
Aged Biji is a widow who is unable to walk talk and look after herself communicates with a bell lives with two sons Ashok and his barren wife Radha and Jatin who is in love with a Chinese-Indian Julie and a male servant Mundu. When Julie refuses to marry him as she dislikes joint family life he is more or less brow-beaten to marry Sita so that she bear a male child to carry on the family name. Ashok has given up on marriage and is now leading a celibate life has become a follower of a religious leader Swamiji and spends all his free time with him. Jatin has not given up on Julie and continues to meet her in his free time. Thus Radha and Sita are left alone most of the time. While Ashok Radha and Sita run a take-out Punjabi food business Jatin runs a video store where he rents out porno movies also on the sly. Mundu passes his free time watching some of these porno movies and masturbating much to Biji's dislike. Then one day Radha surprises Mundu and tells Ashok to fire him. But Mundu knows Radha's secret - a secret that if revealed will tear the lives of the entire family apart.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)

"The film's title ""The Pillow Book"" refers to an ancient Japanese diary the book of observations by Sei Shnagon actual name believed to be Kiyohara Nagiko from whence the protagonist's name in the film.The film is narrated by Nagiko (Vivian Wu) a Japanese born model living in Hong Kong. Nagiko seeks a lover who can match her desire for carnal pleasure with her admiration for poetry and calligraphy. The roots of this obsession lie in her youth in Kyoto when her father (Ken Ogata) would write characters of good fortune on her face. Nagiko's father celebrates her birthday retelling the Japanese creation myth and writing on her flesh in beautiful calligraphy while her aunt (Hideko Yoshida) reads a list of ""beautiful things"" from Sei Shnagon's the book of observations. Nagiko's aunt tells her that when she is twenty-eight years old the official book of observations will be officially 1000 years old and that she Nagiko will be the same age as Sei Shnagon when she had written the book (in addition to sharing her first name). Nagiko also learns around this time that her father is in thrall to his publisher ""Yaji-san"" (Yoshi Oida) who demands sexual favours from her father in exchange for publishing his work.Early chaptersThe publisher arranges Nagiko's wedding to his young apprentice. Her husband (Ken Mitsuishi) an expert archer resents Nagiko's love for books and her desire to read in spite of his apprenticeship. He also refuses to indulge in her desires for pleasure refusing to write on her body. When he discovers and reads Nagiko's pillow book he is extremely resentful setting it on fire and thus setting fire to their marital home an event which Nagiko describes to be the 'first major fire of her life.' Insulted and enraged Nagiko leaves him for good.Hiding from her husband Nagiko moves to Hong Kong. In spite of her aversion to the practice she learns how to type to find work. Outside her apartment a group of activists regularly protest the publishing industry for the depletion of forests due to the need to make paper.After working as a secretary in the office of a Japanese fashion designer for a while Nagiko's employer takes a liking to her and makes her one of his models. As a successful fashion model Nagiko hires a maid (Hideko Yoshida again) as she now finally has the opportunity to explore her sexual desires of being written on. However after several affairs she feels dissatisfied with them all: either they have great penmanship and are lousy lovers or vice-versa.One day at the Cafe Typo Nagiko's favourite haunt she meets Jerome (Ewan McGregor) a British translator. Intrigued by his knowledge they go to a private space where she has Jerome write on her body in various languages. In spite of her interest Nagiko dislikes Jerome's handwriting and orders him out. Jerome totally shocks Nagiko however when he asks her to teach him offering her to write on his body. Opening his shirt he offers Nagiko to ""Use my body like the pages of a book. Of your book!"". Nagiko has never considered this aspect in her desires before: her lovers always write on her body. When she backs out and runs Jerome laughs at her.Frightened but very intrigued by Jerome's suggestion Nagiko has several one-night stands in which she experiments writing on their bodies. One of the activists admirer Hoki (Yutaka Honda) a Japanese photographer who adores her begs Nagiko to take him as a lover. She explains she can't as his skin's no good for writing: whenever she writes on him the ink smears and runs. Hoki not wanting Nagiko to keep carrying on like she is suggests she try writing a book offering to take it to a renowned publisher he freelances for. Nagiko likes this idea and writes her first book.Nagiko's book is returned being told the book is ""not worth the paper it's written on!"". Insulted Nagiko follows the address on the envelope to confront the publisher. Nagiko is shocked to discover that the publisher who rejected her work is in fact Yaji-san her father's old publisher. What's more the publisher has a young lover: Jerome.Devising a plan Nagiko decides that she will get to the publisher through Jerome. Meeting up with Jerome again Nagiko discovers he has learned a few more languages and his penmanship has greatly improved. Nagiko and Jerome spend several weeks exploring this writing on each other and making love. Nagiko soon realises that in Jerome she has found the perfect lover she has been searching for: the partner with whom she can share her physical and her poetic passion using each other's bodies as tablets for their art.Writing of books 1 - 6Nagiko tells Jerome the truth and the whole story with the publisher. Jerome comes up with an idea: Nagiko will write her book on Jerome's body and Jerome will take it to the publisher. Nagiko loves the idea and writes Book 1: The Book of The Agenda in intricate characters of black red and gold on Jerome keeping her identity anonymous. The plan is a success: Jerome sees the publisher and exhibits the book on his nude body and the impressed publisher has his scriveners copy down the text.After telling Nagiko of the plan's success Jerome tells Nagiko that he'll return to her as soon as the publisher who was extremely aroused by the experience lets him go. However during his time with the publisher Jerome appears to lose track of time and doesn't return to Nagiko. Nagiko jealous impatient and angry searches for Jerome eventually finding him making love with the publisher. Nagiko takes this as rejection and betrayal of the worst kind and immediately plots revenge.On two Swedish tourists (Wichert Dromkert and Martin Tukker) Nagiko writes Book 2: The Book of The Innocent and Book 3: The Book of the Idiot. Shortly afterwards an old man (Wu Wei) is running naked through the streets from the publisher's shop bearing Book 4: The Book of Impotence/Old Age. Book 5: The Book of the Exhibitionist is delivered by a boorish fat hyperactive American (Tom Kane).Nagiko's revenge is a success. Jerome is furiously jealous and comes to Nagiko's home to confront her. Nagiko refuses to meet him however and won't let Jerome in. Jerome's outrage soon turns to desperation as he begs her to talk to him but she won't.Jerome sinks into deep depression and meets with Hoki at the Cafe Typo desperate to find a way to get Nagiko to forgive him. Hoki suggests that he ""scare"" Nagiko by faking suicide similar to the fake death scene in Romeo and Juliet and gives Jerome some pills.Arriving at Nagiko's home while she is away Jerome takes some of the pills then writes a page as if writing a book. Each time he takes some pills he writes another page keeping track of how many pills he takes on each page. As the pills take effect Jerome can write no more and lies on the bed naked holding a copy of Sei Shnagon's the book of observations.The plan is a success: when Nagiko returns home and finds Jerome she rushes to him eager to renew their relationship and continue their plans. However the plan has worked too well: Jerome has overdosed on the pills and is dead. Nagiko is devastated and realises how much she loved him. On his dead body Nagiko writes Book 6: The Book of the Lovers.At Jerome's funeral his mother (Barbara Lott) a snobbish upper-class woman tells Nagiko that Jerome always loved things that were ""fashionable"". When she suggests that was probably why Jerome loved Nagiko Nagiko strikes her.After the funeral the publisher secretly exhumes Jerome's body from the tomb and has Jerome's skin still bearing the writing flayed and made into a grotesque pillow book of his own. Nagiko now back in Japan learns of the publisher's actions and becomes distraught and outraged. She sends a letter to the publisher still keeping her identity a secret demanding that particular book from the publisher's hands in exchange for the remaining books. The publisher now obsessed with his mysterious writer and her work agrees.Writing of books 7 - 13Nagiko now pregnant with Jerome's child writes Book 7: The Book of The Seducer on a male messenger. The writing on him is almost destroyed and undecipherable when the publisher accidentally leaves the messenger out in the rain. Book 8: The Book of Youth is delivered as a series of photographs. A young Buddhist monk (Kinya Tsuruyama) then arrives bearing Book 9: The Book of Secrets written on all his ""secret"" spots: in between his fingers and toes the insides of his thighs etc.; the book is presented in the form of riddles. When the next messenger (Rick Waney) arrives he is completely bare: no writing at all. The publisher and staff search for any hint of writing on the messenger's naked body. As the publisher dismisses him as a hoax the man sticks out his tongue bearing Book 10: The Book of Silence.The activists' protests come to an end when their truck hits a young wrestler (Eiichi Tanaka) bearing Book 11: The Book of The Betrayed right outside the publisher's office. The next messenger (Masaru Matsuda) simply drives by the office giving little time to copy down Book 12: The Book of False Starts.Finally Book 13: The Book of the Dead arrives on the body of a Sumo wrestler (Wataru Murofushi). In the book writing on the body of the messenger which the publisher carefully reads Nagiko finally reveals her identity confronting the publisher with his crimes: blackmailing and disgracing her father ""corrupting"" her husband as well as Jerome and what he's done to Jerome's corpse. The publisher greatly shamed and humbled by being confronted with his guilt hands the pillow book made of Jerome's skin to the messenger then has the messenger slit his throat.Upon recovering the book made out of Jerome's skin Nagiko buries it under a Bonsai tree and life goes on. She has given birth to Jerome's child (Hikari Abe) and is shown in the epilogue writing on her child's face like her father used to do when she was young and quoting from her own pillow book. It is now Nagiko's 28th birthday."

"Seymour ""Sy"" Parrish (Robin Williams) a mini-lab photo technician at SavMart's one-hour photo developing clinic in suburban Los Angeles leads a depressing solitary life outside of the ""heaven-like"" hyperreality atmosphere of the department store. Every day he labors to ensure his customers get the best quality photos possible; his life is truly his work as he has no one and nothing to go home to at the end of each day. As each workday comes to an end Sy falls into the inescapable routine of spending his evenings sitting alone in his barren living room watching television. The only thing in Sy's immaculate apartment he has for companionship is a hamster caged in his bedroom. He is an extremely organized tidy and meticulous type of person who wears all beige attire. Feeling out of place in a world where nobody seems to understand the precious gift of friends and family Sy tends to immerse himself in his own fantasies to escape the pain of his existence.His favorite customers are the Yorkin family made up of husband Will (Michael Vartan) wife Nina (Connie Nielsen) and their son Jake (Dylan Smith). He has done their photos for years and over time has developed an obsession with the family; he idolizes their happiness and affluence memorizes every personal detail about them that he can learn and finally begins to stalk them. Sy secretly makes his own copies of the Yorkins' photos from the film negatives and then puts them on a wall in his apartment a massive collage which has accumulated to over 600 in count. Most of all he fantasizes about being a member of their family and sharing in the love he assumes they must feel. However he is painfully shy and his awkward attempts to become closer to the family are gently rebuffed.Sy eventually manages to spark a connection to Nina when he pretends to have interest in a novel he noticed she had been reading on a particular day in the store. For the first time Nina asks Sy personal questions about his life realizing that he is indeed a lonely man something only Jake had empathetically noticed earlier. This connection is short-lived however as Sy's boss Mr. Owens fires him the next day for stealing prints. While inspecting his photos for the last time Sy discovers that Will is having an affair and his idyllic conception of the Yorkins as the 'perfect' family is shattered. He comes to hate and envy Will who has everything Sy longs for yet doesn't seem to care.After losing his job Sy stalks and takes pictures of Owens' young daughter leading to a police investigation against him. While detectives Van Der Zee and Outerbridge (Eriq La Salle and Clark Gregg) are discovering Sy's obsession Sy confronts Will and his mistress Maya (Erin Daniels) during a rendezvous in their hotel room. With a knife and a camera Sy forces the lovers to pose naked while he takes pictures. Throughout the ordeal Maya panics and Sy reacts aggressively but does not harm either of them. After the confrontation as Sy just sits on the bed in his hotel room he discovers that the police have arrived in the hotel and tries to escape. The alarm sounds and Van Der Zee pursues him while Outerbridge discovers Will Yorkin and his mistress unharmed but traumatized. After a chase the police finally apprehend Sy in the parking garage as he attempts to make a break for his car. Upon being arrested. Sy claims ""I just took pictures"".The final scene is set in a police interrogation room where Van Der Zee asks Sy why he terrorized the Yorkins to which Sy indirectly reveals that his father had made him do ""sick disgusting things that no kid should ever have to do"". The implication confirmed by Romanek is that Sy's father exploited him for child pornography. Romanek has also confirmed that Sy had used the camera as a means of both punishing Will and confronting his past as his father used to tell him ""it's all just pretend"" while abusing him. Sy cannot understand why Will as the perfect father was determined to destroy his family and thus permanently ended the fantasy he has held for nearly 10 years.As the detective comes to understand him and prepares to take his confession Sy asks for the pictures he made at the hotel which the detective has described as ""evidence"". They appear to be only shots of household objects and interior furnishings he took after the incident in the hotel. This implies that Sy never took any pictures of Will and Maya but only pretended to. However in the earlier Director's cut version we see additional deleted scenes in which the police analyze the actual crime scene photos that Sy had taken of Will and Maya.The film closes with a picture of the Yorkin family with Sy. Romanek claims in the DVD commentary that the picture is intended to symbolize an open ending; it is left up to the viewer to decide whether the picture only exists in Sy's mind or if he ever sees the Yorkin family again."

"Baghdad in 2004 three soldiers of an Army bomb-disposal unit are investigating a report of an improvised explosive device (IED). They use a sophisticated robot drone to examine the device which consists of several undetonated artillery shells wired together and hidden under plastic/fabric sheets. The unit led by Sgt. Thompson decides that they can detonate the IED using plastic explosives that they'll activate from a safe distance. Thompson also says that the explosion won't cause very much property damage and should result in no loss of life.A small cart is affixed to the back of the robot which is then sent back into the blast zone. Before it can reach the IED the trailer loses a wheel. Thompson dresses in a bulky bomb suit and walks down to the trailer. He picks it up and carries it to the IED rigging it properly. As he walks back his partners Sgt. Sanborn and Specialist Eldridge scan the immediate area for anyone they consider suspicious or who may be in the blast zone. When Thompson is about 25 meters from the bomb but still in the kill zone Eldridge notices a man running a butcher shop who is using a cellular phone. Eldridge yells to Sanborn and the specialist begins to run toward the man ordering him to drop his phone. Sanborn tells Eldridge to shoot the man who presses a sequence of numbers on the phone. The bomb detonates with Thompson still in the kill zone. The overpressure from the bomb kills Thompson despite the bomb suit; a large splash of blood hits the inside of the clear visor on his helmet.Thompson's body is packed into a coffin for shipment home Sanborn supervises the procedure. He looks over Thompson's possessions for a few moments before the coffin is sealed. Back at the base Eldridge is sitting in the rec room when the base psychologist Lt. Col. Cambridge walks in and asks Eldridge how he's feeling (in the wake of Thompson's death). Eldridge is still clearly upset over the incident; he dry fires his rifle several times suggesting that if he'd shot the man with the cell phone Thompson might still be alive.A new leader for the team Sgt. William James arrives at the base. Sanborn meets him at his housing unit where James is taking the plywood covers off his windows. When Sanborn suggests that James keep them on because of mortar shrapnel James tells him that they won't be any good anyway if a mortar shell crashes in through the unit's roof.The next day the team responds to a report of another IED on a narrow street in the city. After the initial investigation where they link up with the Army platoon that reported the bomb James is dressed up in a suit similar to the one Thompson wore previously. As James approaches the bomb site he tosses a smoke grenade which agitates Sanborn who can't see James to instruct him further. James also is uncommunicative with his team members another factor that Sanborn does not appreciate. James finds an artillery shell buried under a small pile of trash. He disarms it easily and then notices a secondary wire leading away from it. He uncovers the cable and finds it connects to a junction of six more cables. When James pulls on the junction connector six more shells are uncovered. Another cable leads to a nearby building. James disarms the six new shells; as he does he notices a man quickly leaving the building presumably the bomber. James flashes one of the small detonators from one of the shells and smiles at the man who vanishes from sight. Back at their Humvee Sanborn tells James that he needs to communicate more during operations and not treat his duty as if it's a solo act. James brushes his teammate off. James does the same later when he and Sanborn talk while grooming themselves for another day's work in the latrine.The team is again called out for another bomb threat. This time the bomb is in a car parked in front of a United Nations building. When the building is evacuated James dons the bomb suit and walks toward the car which suddenly becomes engulfed in flames. James uses a fire extinguisher to put out the fire and begins to examine the car while Eldridge and Sanborn take up their positions as lookouts. James opens the trunk and finds several of the same type of artillery shells he'd seen the day before. After a few moments he takes his bomb suit off completely knowing it won't protect him; there is enough explosive in the car to kill everyone nearby including his teammates even if they take cover. James disarms the shells and begins to search the car for the triggering device a process that takes several minutes. At one point when Sanborn tries to talk to him through a headset James finds it distracting so he pulls it off and throws it aside. A few more very tense minutes pass as James searches the car. Sanborn and Eldridge notice several groups of Iraqis watching them from rooftops and from a minaret. They also see a man filming the incident with a video camera. At the car James finally finds the triggering device and detaches it. When he returns to the Hummer he lights a cigarette and is promptly hit in the face by Sanborn who is again angry that James refused to acknowledge him or any questions he had. James appears strangely unoffended nor is he angry at Sanborn. A colonel on the scene approaches James and is clearly impressed with James steady nerves and ability to handle such a crisis. When he asks James how many bombs he's disposed of James gives him an exact number. The colonel is further impressed.Back at the base perimeter Sgt. James confronts an Iraqi kid who sells pirated DVDs to the soldiers. The boy who kicks a soccer ball around and calls himself Beckham had sold James a movie a few days before; James wants his $5 back because the DVD was poor in quality. When Beckham tries to hustle him further James is amused and tells him he can keep the money if he's able to block a shot at the makeshift goal area Beckham has set up. Beckham blocks the shot and James agrees to buy another movie from him mildly threatening him if it's defective.The team goes out to the desert to detonate some of the explosives they've collected on missions. As they prepare to explode another bomb James stops Sanborn to briefly drive down to the blast zone to get the gloves he left there. While he's gone Sanborn tells Eldridge that with the dangerous nature of the explosives they detonate in the desert it would be easy to ""frag"" him by exploding the bomb while James is down there and claiming it was accidental. Sanborn seems pretty intent on doing so but Eldridge convinces him not to.While heading back to the city the team sees two SUVs parked on their route. They approach them and the occupants standing around as if they were any other threat. The men standing near the vehicles quickly obey Sanborn and his team dropping their weapons. One of the men reveals himself to be a British commando and the bomb unit relaxes. The British man says they have a flat tire but have broken their jack handle. James offers them equipment from their Hummer. While one of the British men handles the flat tire the Brit shows the bomb unit members the men he has captured (presumably high level Iraqi officials) to turn in for a reward. Suddenly the man fixing the tire is hit by sniper fire and falls before the shot is actually heard. Everyone runs for cover; the British commando mercilessly shoots both of his prisoners as they run away; the reward for capture dead or alive is the same.The bomb unit and the Brits find themselves pinned down. Another of the Brits is killed while manning the Hummer's .50 caliber machine gun. The British team leader takes up a sniper's position on a small rocky hill and begins to return fire with a Barrett rifle shooting at a distant stone building where the enemy sniper and a small group are hiding. While adjusting the Barrett's bipod the man is hit in the chest by the enemy sniper and killed. Sanborn takes up the man's rifle and James spots for him using a powerful scope. They fire several shots back at their enemy and run out of ammunition for the rifle. James has Eldridge search the dead man's pouches and he finds a full magazine. However the man's blood has leaked onto the rounds and they must be cleaned off to cycle through the Barrett rifle. James helps a queasy Eldridge clean off the rounds. Sanborn is able to continue targeting the building and its occupants and with James spotting they're able to kill all the enemy troops. Eldridge notices someone who may be another sniper lurking at a position behind James and Sanborn and he opens fire. Eldridge is unsure of how well he did but the other man is hit and killed.The incident seems to form a stronger bond between James and his teammates. Having found that they can actually work well together as a team they celebrate at James' housing unit taking turns pounding each other in the chest and drinking. After discussing why James seems to be such a maverick teammate and how he got into their line of work James shows them a box of parts he's collected from nearly every bomb he's disarmed. He says he keeps them as reminders of how dangerous his work is. Eldridge and Sanborn are a bit puzzled but now know after the desert incident that James is actually a team player.On their next mission Colonel Cambridge accompanies the team when they patrol a building where bomb making material has been seen. Cambridge stays outside while the team searches the building. Inside they find the bomb making supplies and evidence that the bomb makers had just left. James finds the body of a young boy whom appears to be Beckham. He orders Sanborn and Eldridge out of the building spots a large incision in the boy's chest. He opens it and finds several pounds of plastic explosive in the body's abdominal cavity. He carries the boy outside to the Humvee. Outside Cambridge is trying to clear the locals from the street when another IED goes off killing him. In the immediate aftermath Eldridge cannot accept Cambridge's death and wanders the area looking for him. He also finds Cambridge's helmet lying in the blast area.Back at the base James talks to a man who sells DVDs at the perimeter. James asks the man if he knows Beckham however the man's English isn't very good and he tells him nothing. James asks the nearby sergeant if the man checks out & the sergeant tells him the man is cleared. Later when the man packs up his merchandise and leaves James jumps in his truck and forces him to take him to Beckham's house. James enters the house and finds another man in the kitchen who is scared but surprisingly hospitable. James demands to know where Beckham is at gunpoint but the man doesn't know. James realizes he's mistakenly entered the wrong home and turns to leave when the man's wife appears and begins to yell and throw things at him. James makes his way back through the city to the base passing hundreds of angry-looking locals. At the main gate he announces he's a US soldier and is forcibly arrested. When the duty sergeant demands an explanation for his being off the base at night James says he was at a whorehouse. The sergeant slyly asks him where it is.The team responds to a call at night to check out a bomb blast zone. When they get there they find that a bomb possibly from a suicide bomber went off near an oil tanker truck causing a huge blast radius. James scouts the perimeter of the blast area and theorizes that the bomber didn't commit suicide but stood outside the perimeter and triggered the blast from there. James is furious and vows to find the bomber by ordering Sanborn and Eldridge to search the nearby streets. The three split up; shots are heard and Sanborn and James reconnect however they spot Eldridge being dragged off by two unidentified men. The two open fire killing Eldridge's kidnappers but James hits Eldridge in the leg. James becomes severely upset at wounding his comrade and nearly breaks down in the shower fully clothed.The next day James and Sanborn go to meet Eldridge at the helicopter that will evacuate him. As he approaches their Humvee Beckham unexpectedly alive appears and tries to talk to him but James ignores him. At the helicopter Eldridge is bitter with James for shooting him saying his femur has been shattered and recovery will take months. He also berates James for taking them into a danger zone to satisfy his adrenaline rush. Eldridge is flown off.Sanborn and James respond to another bomb report and find a man standing alone in the middle of a large plaza. James has the translator order the man to his knees and he suits up and walks to him. When the man opens his coat James sees he's wearing several pounds of C-4 attached to several steel bars which are locked together with large padlocks. The man pleads for his life saying he has a family. With only two minutes left on the bomb's timer James frantically tries to cut the locks however there are too many and James must leave the man behind. Seconds later the bomb goes off killing the man and throwing James in his bomb suit out of the blast area. Sanborn rushes to him thinking he's been killed like Thompson was. James is only stunned and wakes up. As they head back to the base Sanborn still shaken by the incident tells James that he fears he will die in Iraq having never had a wife or children. James tries to comfort him and convince his friend he'll make it back home and start a family.The team's rotation ends and James goes back to his home and family. While shopping in a store he is overwhelmed by the cereal aisle which has too many products for him to comprehend. He also is unable to adjust to home life and his relationship with his wife and daughter becomes increasingly strained. James decides to return to Iraq. The final scene of the movie shows him beginning a new rotation and approaching another bomb site in his suit.======================During the early months of the post-invasion period in Iraq Sergeant First Class William James becomes the new team leader of an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) unit with the U.S. Army's Bravo Company replacing Staff Sergeant Thompson who was killed by a remote-detonated improvised explosive device (IED) in Baghdad. He joins Sergeant J.T. Sanborn and Specialist Owen Eldridge whose jobs are to communicate with their team leader via radio inside his bombsuit and provide him with rifle cover while he examines an IED. James's insistence on approaching a suspected IED without first sending in a bomb disposal robot during their first mission together lead Sanborn and Eldridge to consider him ""reckless"". Back at Camp Victory James befriends Beckham a young Iraqi boy who works for a local merchant operating at the base selling pirated DVD movies to the soldiers. The team is next called out to the United Nations building in Baghdad where a parked car has a large bomb in the trunk. While James intensively studies the intricate bomb Sanborn and Eldridge provide him with cover. Sanborn becomes increasingly concerned about three men watching them from a minaret and another filming them from a nearby rooftop. With the building evacuated he suggests to James that the they pull out and let a team of engineers come disarm the bomb. James ignores and angers Sanborn by removing his radio headset and his bomb suit and remains with the car until he disarms the device.While returning from detonating bombs in the desert the EOD team encounter a British private military company. They soon come under enemy attack and three of the British mercenaries are killed in the ensuing firefight which ends after Sanborn and James shoot the last of the insurgent snipers. For their next mission the team heads to a warehouse to retrieve unexploded ordnance. While securing the warehouse James discovers the dead body of a young boy who has been surgically implanted with an unexploded bomb. James is sure that it is Beckham while Sanborn and Eldridge are not entirely certain. That night James forces the merchant for whom Beckham worked to drive him to Beckham's house. Upon entering the house to which he is brought James encounters an Iraqi professor and demands to know who was responsible for turning Beckham into a ""body bomb"". The professor thinks James is a CIA agent and calmly invites him to sit down as a guest of his household. A confused James is then forced out of the house by the man's wife and sneaks back into Camp Victory with the help of a sympathetic guard. That same night Eldridge is accidentally shot in the leg during a mission in which the EOD team successfully tracks down and kills two bomb makers. The next morning James is approached by Beckham who is alive and well. Much to Beckham's confusion he is completely ignored by James. Eldridge blames James for his injury claiming James unnecessarily put his life at risk just so that he could have an ""adrenaline fix"" referring to Sanborn's suggestion that the mission which James had ordered would be better suited for an infantry platoon.With only two days left on their current tour James and Sanborn are called in to assist in a situation where a man was forced to wander into a military checkpoint with a time-bomb strapped to his chest. James cannot remove the bomb nor disarm it in time and is forced to flee before the bomb goes off. On the ride back to the base Sanborn becomes emotional and confesses to James that he can no longer cope with the pressure of being in EOD and relishes the prospect of finally leaving Iraq and starting a family. James is next seen back at home with his wife and child visibly bored with civilian life. One night he has an internal monologue in the form of speaking aloud to his infant son where he says that there is only ""one thing"" that he knows he loves. He is next seen back in Iraq ready to serve another year as part of an EOD team with Delta Company."
During the Iraq War a Sergeant recently assigned to an army bomb squad is put at odds with his squad mates due to his maverick way of handling his work.
An intense portrayal of elite soldiers who have one of the most dangerous jobs in the world: disarming bombs in the heat of combat. When a new sergeant James takes over a highly trained bomb disposal team amidst violent conflict he surprises his two subordinates Sanborn and Eldridge by recklessly plunging them into a deadly game of urban combat behaving as if he's indifferent to death. As the men struggle to control their wild new leader the city explodes into chaos and James' true character reveals itself in a way that will change each man forever.::BWR Public Relations
When SFC William James joins Bravo Company in Iraq they have a month or so left in their tour of duty. He's a bomb disposal expert sent to replace Sgt. Matt Thompson a long-standing member of the team recently killed while disposing of an improvised explosive device. To say that James loves what he does doesn't quite capture the emotional high he experiences when he gets to do what he does best. His fellow squad members (Sgt. JT Sanborn and Spc. Owen Eldridge) just want to survive the few days of duty they have left but James' risk-taking drives them all to the edge.::garykmcd / edited by statmanjeff

The Bravo Company's bomb disposal unit currently stationed in Baghdad comprises US Army Sergeant First Class Will James Sergeant JT Sanborn and Specialist Owen Eldridge. James the new tech team leader arrives on the scene when Bravo Company has just thirty-nine days left on its current deployment. It will be a long thirty-nine days for Sanborn and Eldridge whose styles do not mesh with their new leader (a renegade for whom the thrill of the dismantlement seems to be the ultimate goal regardless of safety for his fellow team members for others on the scene or for himself). By contrast Sanborn is all by the books knowing his place and duty and trusting others in the army to carry out their assignments just as well as he does. Eldridge on the other hand is an insecure soldier constantly worried that an error or misjudgment on his part will lead to the death of an innocent civilian or a military colleague. While the three members face their own internal issues they have to be aware of any person at the bomb sites some of whom may be bombers themselves.::Huggo / edited by statmanjeff

"Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) is a young American who has abandoned a privileged life at a university to enlist in the infantry volunteering for combat duty in Vietnam. The year is September 1967. Upon arrival in Da Nang South Vietnam he sees dead soldiers of American soldiers in body bags being loaded into his plane. Taylor and the other recruits pass by a group of soldiers also departing on the plane who laugh at the ""new guys"" but more distressing to Taylor is the shell-shocked state of a departing soldier with the ""thousand-yard stare."" Taylor and several other replacements have been assigned to Bravo Company 25th Infantry division ""somewhere near the Cambodian border."" The platoon goes out on patrol in the trackless and inhospitable jungle dealing with mud thick bushes snakes and ants. Worn down by the exhausting work and living conditions of patrolling Taylor's enthusiasm for the war wanes quickly and he develops an admiration for the more experienced soldiers despite their reluctance to extend their friendship.One day another new arrival platoon commander Lieutenant Wolfe (Mark Moses) discusses the plans for a patrol later that night with the platoon sergeants: the compassionate Sergeant Elias (Willem Dafoe) harsh but hard core Staff Sergeant Barnes (Tom Berenger) cowardly sycophantic ""lifer"" Sergeant Red O'Neil (John C. McGinley) and drug addict Sergeant Warren (Tony Todd). Barnes and Elias argue over whether to send the new men out on a patrol that is likely to be ambushed. O'Neil insists that the new troops go out instead of several men under him who are nearly finished with their tours of duty. Barnes agrees only on the condition that O'Neil goes out as well.That night North Vietnamese soldiers set upon Taylor's sleeping unit. Gardner (Bob Orwig) a fellow new recruit is killed and another soldier Tex (David Neidorf) is maimed. Despite having passed the watch duty to Junior (Reggie Johnson) a more experienced but consistently irresponsible soldier who fell asleep Taylor is blamed for the casualties (O'Neil is also to blame having thrown the grenade that maimed Tex). Immediately after the fighting Taylor discovers a light wound to his neck and he is sent to the field hospital for treatment.A few days later Taylor returns to his unit from the hospital and through a soldier named King (Keith David) gains acceptance from the ""heads"" a tight-knit group led by Elias that socializes dances and takes drugs in a private bunker. Next door in another bunker Barnes leads the more traditional members of the unit whom drink beer play cards and don't smoke opium. Taylor becomes a more seasoned soldier as the patrols continue and soon no longer stands out among the others.During one patrol on New Years Day January 1 1968 the platoon finds what appears to be an abandoned bunker. Elias explores a series of tunnels connected to the bunker. Two members of the platoon Sandy (J. Adam Glover) and Sal (Richard Edson) are killed when they stumble upon a booby trap attached to a box of documents. Shortly after a soldier named Manny Washington (Corkey Ford) goes missing. His mutilated body is found tied to a post close by. The platoon is infuriated by the senseless death of their comrade and are ordered to report to a nearby village of South Vietnamese citizens.The platoon reaches the village where a food and weapons cache is discovered. The other soldiers explore the village. In one house Taylor discovers a mute and mentally challenged teenage boy and his mother hiding in a hole beneath the floor. Taylor harasses and taunts the retarded boy by shooting his rifle at his feet but stops himself short of killing the boy. However Bunny (Kevin Dillon) takes over and beats the boy to death with his gun even though Sgt. O'Neil orders them to leave the hut. While questioning the village chief Barnes loses his patience and senselessly kills the man's wife despite his denials that they are aiding the Viet Cong. Barnes is about to murder the man's young daughter to force him to tell them to where the enemy is when Sergeant Elias arrives at the scene and starts a fistfight with Barnes. Lieutenant Wolfe passive during the shooting of the wife eventually ends the fight and relays orders from his own superior officer to burn the village. As the men leave a group of four soldiers including Bunny and Junior drag a young Vietnamese girl into the bushes with the intention of raping her. Taylor comes upon them and stops the group from raping the girl. His comrades ridicule him for stopping them.Upon returning to base Elias reports Barnes' actions to Captain Harris (Dale Dye) who cannot afford to remove Barnes due to a lack of personnel. However Harris threatens to court martial Barnes if there is evidence that he murdered an unarmed civilian. O'Neil and Bunny nervous about the possibility of an investigation speak to Barnes and Bunny suggests ""fragging"" Elias. A narrating Taylor speaks of this as ""a civil war in the platoon. Half with Elias half with Barnes."" Taylor talks with Elias one night and Elias tells him that the United States is due for a loss in war because they'd been mostly successful in past wars. He also confesses that he's disillusioned with America's mission in Southeast Asia that he used to believe it was winnable even a few years ago but knows now that it's not.On their next patrol the platoon is ambushed and pinned down in a firefight by unseen enemy soldiers. Flash (Basile Achara) is killed and Sergeant Warren and Private Lerner (Johnny Depp) are badly injured in the resulting skirmish. Lieutenant Wolfe calls in wrong coordinates for artillery support resulting in the deaths of Fu Sheng (Steve Barredo) Morehouse (Kevin Eshelman) and Tubbs (Andrew B. Clark) and the severe wounding of Ace (Terry McIlvain). Big Harold (Forest Whitaker) has his leg blown off by a trip-wired booby trap while trying to escape the artillery barrage. Elias with Taylor Rhah (Francesco Quinn) and Crawford (Chris Pedersen) go to intercept flanking enemy troops. Though Lt. Wolfe is commanding officer Barnes takes command. He orders the rest of the platoon to retreat to be airlifted from the area and goes back into the jungle to find Elias' group. After sending Taylor Rhah and Crawford (who has been shot in the lung) back Barnes finds Elias. The two stare at each other for a few moments and then Barnes fires three rounds into Elias' chest and leaves him for dead. Barnes runs into Taylor and tells him that Elias is dead and that he'd seen his body nearby. Barnes orders Taylor back to the landing zone. After they take off the men see a severely wounded Elias emerge from the jungle running from a large group of NVA soldiers. He dies after being shot several more times by the NVA while the American helicopters futilely attempt to provide him cover overhead. As they fly from the area Chris takes a long look at Barnes' hardened face.At the base Taylor tries to talk his dwindling group of six ""heads"" into killing Barnes in retaliation claiming that when he'd met Barnes in the forest after shooting Elias that the look on Barnes' face told him the truth. While King agrees Doc Gomez (Paul Sanchez) believes they should wait for ""military justice"" to decide Barnes' fate. Rhah reminds Taylor how much he admired Barnes when he first arrived and that Barnes isn't meant to die noting that on several previous occasions Barnes has sustained wounds that ought to have proved mortal: ""the only thing that can kill Barnes is Barnes."" Barnes then appears very drunk with a bottle of bourbon having overheard Taylor calling for his murder. He enters the room daring them to kill him. No one takes up the offer but as Barnes leaves Taylor attacks him. Barnes quickly gets the upper hand pins Taylor down and holds a knife to his face. Rhah urges him not to do it telling Barnes he'll be court-martialed and imprisoned and he leaves after slashing Taylor under the eye.A few days later the platoon is sent back to the ambush area in order to build and maintain heavy defensive positions against a potential attack. Rhah is promoted to Sergeant commanding the remains of Elias' squad. The platoon is so severely weakened though that there are numerous gaps in their defense. When this fact is pointed out to him Lt. Wolfe only replies that he doesn't ""give a fuck"" any more. The troops try to prepare for the incoming battle during which they know the majority of them will die. Just hours before nightfall King is allowed to go home as his tour of duty has come to an end. O'Neil tries to use Elias' R&R days for himself in order to escape the impending battle (in which he believes he will die). When he asks Barnes for permission Barnes refuses saying ""Everybody gotta die some time Red."" Junior tries to escape the battle by spraying mosquito repellent onto his feet and passing it off as trench foot a ploy that Barnes recognizes right away. Bunny states that he feels no remorse for the murders he has committed saying that he enjoys Vietnam and goes on to proclaim himself to be ""Audie Murphy"" a famous and highly decorated World War II hero.Francis (Corey Glover) one of the last few remaining ""heads"" is assigned to the same foxhole as Taylor. That night a large attack occurs and the American defensive perimeter is broken and the camp overrun by hundreds of attacking North Vietnamese troops. Taylor and Francis take on and cut down several attacking enemy troops until they both pause when they hear signal whistles from the unseen NVA sergeants ordering their men to cease fire. Hearing a Vietnamese voice over a bullhorn and understanding that the NVA are ordering RPGs up to the line to blow up the foxhole they are in Taylor grabs Francis and both of them crawl out of the foxhole seconds before it's hit by an RPG. Taylor and Francis then attack and kill several enemy soldiers that overrun their destroyed foxhole until Taylor loses it during the fight and charges off into the carnage shooting one enemy soldier after another.Meanwhile the NVA attack against the base continues relentlessly. The command bunker is destroyed by a NVA suicide bomber (Oliver Stone makes a cameo as the doomed battalion commander inside the bunker). During the massed North Vietnamese Army attack many members of the platoon are killed including Lt. Wolfe Parker (Peter Hicks) Doc Bunny and Junior when their foxholes are overrun. The cowardly O'Neil survives only by hiding himself under a dead body. The desperate company commander Captain Harris orders the Air Force pilots to ""expend all remaining"" inside his perimeter. During the chaos Barnes and Taylor come face-to-face. As a crazed Barnes is about to beat Taylor with a shovel the two are knocked unconscious by the last-ditch American napalm attack.A wounded Taylor regains consciousness the next morning with a serious wound to his lower abdomen caused by Barnes striking him with the sharpened edge of the shovel earlier from the night before. Taylor soon finds Barnes who is also wounded after being shot in both legs during the battle. Taylor takes an AK-47 rifle from a dead enemy soldier and aims it at Barnes who lays helpless on the ground. Nonetheless Barnes feels at first not threatened and he dismissively orders Taylor to call a medic. When Taylor does not comply but instead continues to aim his weapon Barnes (deranged to the last) dares him to pull the trigger by saying: ""Do it!"" Taylor shoots Barnes three times in the chest killing him. Taylor then drops his rifle collapses and awaits medical attention.Interestingly although not in the script Taylor is seen on the verge of pulling the pin of a grenade that he found only to drop it as reinforcements come to Taylor. (Charlie Sheen thought that Taylor would be committing suicide after killing Barnes. Oliver Stone thought that the mistake was good so he decided to keep it in the film.)Francis emerges from his foxhole and stabs himself in the thigh with a bayonet in order to be evacuated as a casualty. O'Neil is found by other Americans and Harris (much to O'Neil's distress) gives him command of the platoon. As he is loaded onto the helicopter Taylor is reminded by Francis that because they have been wounded twice they can go home. Back at the bombed-out command post hundreds of NVA bodies are being dumped into mass graves. After bidding farewell to Rhah Francis Tony Hoyt (Ivan Kane) and Ebenhoch (Mark Ebenhoch) (his last surviving friends in the platoon; the other survivors are Rodriguez (Chris Castillejo) Huffmeister (Robert Galotti) and O'Neil) Taylor boards his helicopter. The helicopter flies away and Taylor weeps as he stares down at the destruction while he (from a future perspective) narrates that he will forever be in Vietnam with Barnes and Elias battling for what Rhah called ""possession of his soul"" and that he believes he and other veterans must rebuild themselves and find goodness and purpose in their lives."

"In December of 2002 Grant Taylor's (Alex Kendrick) Eagles of Shiloh Christian Academy are slightly behind against the Tucker Tigers late in the fourth quarter. Taylor shouts to Zach Avery (Brandon Glow) ""Cross the Thirty!"" He wants his offense to get within good field-goal position. But Zach though his receiver Jonathan Weston (Tommy McBride) is open gets sacked. Since this is fourth down the Tigers take the ball fall on it and run out the clock. So ends the game and another losing season--Taylor's sixth in a row.The 2003 season begins with some dire news: Darrin the Eagles' top scorer in 2002 has moved in with his father so he can transfer to the rival Tucker school. Taylor's offensive and defensive co-coordinators J. T. Hawkins (Chris Willis) and Brady Owens (Tracy Goode) break it to him. He then has to break it to his players who of course take it very badly.When Grant drives home his car dies after he barely gets off the road. His house has a very bad smell which neither he nor his wife Brooke (Shannen Fields) can figure out. Their evening meal will be cold because their stove does not work. Also their combined salaries ($24000 a year for Grant and the $6000 that Brooke makes in the local florist's shop) will not let them improve their situation. And to top it all Brooke desperately wants to be pregnant and yet again takes a home pregnancy test finds it negative and carelessly leaves the test kit for Grant to find.In the next scene sportscaster Alicia Houston (Erin Catt) reports on this year's defending champions the Richland Giants. Coach Bobby Lee Duke (Jim McBride) is itching for a match-up with anyone who dares challenge their title.That Friday night the season begins--badly. Twenty-three to nothing--and on their home turf yet. The failure of Grant's car to start in the parking lot does not help his mood. Nor does Brooke's embarrassment as Grant has to ask Brady to give him a jump start. He'd like to buy a new compact car but the facts remain: they cannot afford it. Brooke also says her gynecologist says there is no physical reason why Brooke cannot have children. So Grant agrees to see a urologist to check his own reproductive system.Monday begins with a student named Stanley (Jason Rossi) finding himself desk and all on top of the teacher's desk. With the students laughing at him he dismounts--with difficulty. Then the teacher tells Brock Kelley the team captain that he and Stanley are in detention for their little joke--and for their poor grades.The coaching team faces some more sad facts: they have the toughest season they've ever had with the least amount of talent. In the middle of it Grant leaves for his doctor's appointment--and leaves J. T. and Brady to argue about what kind of doctor Grant is going to. (J. T. suggests Grant is going to see a dermatologist to see about a hair transplant; Brady doubts that.)That afternoon David Childers (Bailey Cave) talks to his father Larry Childers (Steve Williams) about his athletic options. He is new at Shiloh and they don't have a soccer program. Larry encourages his son to try out for the football team as a kicker even though he is of shorter stature than average and has never kicked a football in his life.The next afternoon Alvin Pervis (Mike Garner) one of the fathers talks to Brady Owens and invites him to a secret meeting aimed at replacing Grant Taylor as head coach--and naming Brady to replace him. The fathers have asked for a meeting with Dan Ryker(Dennis Erickson) the A.D. Grant asks Brady about the talk with Pervis but gets nothing out of him. Just then Larry and David Childers show up and David tries out as a kicker. Jonathan Weston the regular kick holder doesn't mind the tryout--because Joshua Webster (Chris Matthews with Mark Gahagan as stunt double) the regular place kicker doubles as a wide receiver and would rather receive than kick. David kicks a lot of balls wide or short--but finally manages to kick the ball straight through the goal posts.After practice Matt Prater (James Blackwell) has another fruitless argument with his father Neil Prater (Bill Butler) over his after-practice schedule--and the coaching team notices old Mr. Bridges (Ray Wood) praying over the school lockers as he always does. J. T. recommends that David Childers stay on the team as a relief kicker.However that Friday night Shiloh loses to Dewey County twenty-one to seven--when Dewey hasn't beaten Shiloh in more than ten years. And angry Grant roars at his players for their apathy the missed practices and all the mistakes they made on the field.David talks to his father about that sobering session and about whether he can help the team at all as a kicker. Larry encourages his son not to give in to his fears. (The wheelchair-bound Larry also gives his son a turn when he tries to touch up a paint spot his son missed and falls back into his chair making a racket that brings David running.)On Monday Grant sees the urologist Dr. William Jordan (Wayne Holley) for his follow-up appointment. The news is dire: his sperm count is low. Too low. (The film does not mention this but that's the most logical problem.) Grant spends the day moping about it even staying late at the school because he doesn't want to face Brooke. And so he overhears Alvin Pervis Neil Prader and Luke Prey talking to A. D. Dan Ryker about replacing him. Ryker stands up for his head coach but he has three fathers telling him that Grant has to go. What makes it worse: Brady Owens is at that meeting saying nothing. Ryker makes no decision--but Grant does not stick around to hear the end of the meeting.A humiliated Grant finally goes home and confesses everything to Brooke--about the secret meeting he overheard with the A. D. and about what the urologist told him. That scene ends with the two of them sitting at their kitchen table and crying. That night Brooke wakes up at 3:11 a.m. to find Grant sitting up in their living room reading a book--presumably his Bible. So she gets down on her knees and prays.On Saturday morning Grant walks out into a nearby forest and offers a heartfelt prayer to God to tell him what His will really is for his life. It's early so Brooke once again wakes up in an empty bed--but now she comes out to join him and assure him she will accept whatever adventure the Lord sends them.The next game ends just as badly as the last two. David Childers takes a shot at a field goal--and misses. David feels terrible about that but Larry will not let his son quit.Alvin Pervis takes yet another chance to ask Brady Owens to try out for head coach to replace Grant. This time Grant walks up and stares Alvin down forcing him to retreat. Then Grant tells Brady to decide once for all whose side he is on and stay on it.On Monday morning Mr. Bridges does more than pray over lockers. He walks in on Grant to share with him Revelation 3:7-8 about Him Who opens and no man shuts and shuts and no man opens. He also shares with Grant a parable about two farmers who prayed for rain--but only one of them cultivated his fields to prepare for that rain.Grant takes the hint. He draws up a new working team philosophy: to give all to God and concentrate on that not on something idle like winning games. Brooke likes what he has written and sees that it's applicable to their home life too.Grant lays this on the team the next day with a simple illustration: no one can remember who won the State championship five years earlier.Out on the field Grant tells them that their attitude is ""the aroma of the heart."" If the heart stinks so does the attitude and that carries over. To prove that he puts his players through the Death Crawl--on all fours with the knees off the ground and another teammate on one's back--for ten yards. But when Brock Kelley (Jason McLeod) the lead tackle and his friend Jeremy Johnson (Chris Heape) start talking about the coming match with Westview as if it is already lost Grant singles out Brock and Jeremy for a special exercise. He will ask Brock to do the Death Crawl with Jeremy on his back for fifty yards--blindfolded. Of course what he actually does is push Brock to go all the way to the opposite end zone--and when the rest of the team sees that they stand up and stare in wonder. Grant tells Brock that he Brock is the most influential player on the team--so his attitude affects others.The demonstration impresses Brock and the rest of the team. It also impresses J. T.--and Brady who at last decides whose side he's on.Grant then takes a moment to tell Matt Prater to stop taking a disrespectful attitude toward his father. ""You can't judge your father by his acts and then judge yourself by your intentions. It doesn't work that way"" he says. One complication exists: Matt is at Shiloh because Westview kicked him out. That will be important later in the week. (Recall that Neil Prader is also one of the three fathers who tried to persuade the A. D. to fire Grant.)That evening Grant finally finds the source of the bad smell in the house: a dead mouse. He teases Brooke unmercifully about it but is still glad to get rid of it.The next day J. T. finally tells David Childers what he needs to know about kicking: not to approach every kick as if he's going to kick it wide. He even quotes the Scriptures about the wide gate and the narrow gate. Brady loves overhearing that and so does Grant. More to the point: it works because David does start kicking the ball straight.Next day another teacher shows a truly awesome scene: a revival happening right on the field this after Mitch (Brian Kelley) the Bible teacher brought his class out to the field. Matt Prater started it the teacher says. While Mr. Bridges makes his blessing walk along the lockers Matt asks Grant to drive him to his father's workplace--so that Matt can tell Neil Prater in front of his business associate Mr. Jones (David Nixon) that from now on what he says goes. Neil is profoundly grateful to hear his son say that--and is even more grateful to Coach Grant Taylor for bringing Matt in so Matt could say that.Friday night arrives for the match with Westview. Grant gives one last pep talk before letting Brock Kelley lead the team in prayer.And this time the outcome is a lot different: Shiloh beats Westview.The team has a new attitude that carries into their studies. Teachers look twice at these former ""dumb jocks"" who are at last applying themselves to their studies as well as they apply themselves on the playing field.More games take place with straight wins. Walker Jennings falls. Then David Childers kicks the winning field goal against another school.Next Monday afternoon Neil Prater and his son anonymously give Grant another incredible gift: a brand-new Ford F-130 pickup truck. They even swap it out for his old blue car with the dying battery. ""Not a word to anyone"" Neil commands his son. Grant hardly dares believe it--but the title doesn't lie.The victories keep rolling in as the season rolls on. Ivey Grove falls 14-10. Next week Shiloh wins its fifth straight victory. And then the sixth--which sends Shiloh into the State playoffs.The day after that last win Grant drops into Brooke's flower shop and places an order with Brooke--for flowers that he will give her when he takes her out to dinner. He has news: Dan Ryker gave him a $6000 raise.The playoffs begin but don't go so well. Shiloh plays the Panthers of Princeton Heights Academy--and loses 28-10. Grant encourages his players to praise God anyway win or lose. Matt Prater takes the lead to encourage the team to do just that.And on Monday afternoon Stanley Shultz (Walter Burnett) of the Georgia Inter-Scholastic Athletic League calls Grant with electrifying gotta-sit-down-for-this news. Grant summons his players to break it to them: Princeton Heights fielded two ineligible 19-year-olds. Results: Princeton Heights disqualified and Shiloh advances to the next round--against Tucker where Darrin had transferred.Friday night arrives and the Eagles beat the Tucker Tigers. Putting in the game-winning score: relief kicker David Childers.Next week Brooke tells her employer (Jackie Everson) that she has been nauseous for two mornings in a row. The employer tells her to see a doctor.Friday night arrives and Mr. Bridges listens as the Eagles score a game-winning touchdown. Twenty-to-seventeen and the Eagles now will face the Richland Giants in the State final.The last Friday arrives: Eagles against Giants. That morning Brooke encourages Grant not to give in to fear--and not to worry about her either though she won't tell him where she will go.She goes to the gynecologist and takes yet another pregnancy test.David Childers prepares for his big night though he is convinced he will never play because he is still second-string.At the gynecologist's office a heartbroken Nurse Laura (Cynthia Overvoll) gets the news from another nurse (Shelly Brown): the pregnancy test is negative--again. Laura breaks this news to Brooke. But as Brooke prepares to leave the filing nurse (Candace Howell) discovers with a shock that they have mixed up the results! Brooke Taylor's results are in fact positive! The excited Laura rushes out to the parking lot to tell Brooke before she can pull out.Game time arrives and Grant's old coach at Shiloh (Mark Richt) comes to give Grant some encouragement.Bobby Lee Duke is as cocky as ever with his eighty-five players against only thirty-two for the Eagles. The first half goes well enough for the Giants. Fourteen-to-nothing Giants. Grant Taylor orders: blitz on the next first down. They do--and intercept a pass and return it for a score! The half ends: fourteen to seven Giants.Grant now orders: outsmart them with trick plays.Second half begins and the Eagles' tricks work. They tie the game. Then Coach Duke orders: ""Make them pay!"" A Giant player takes that literally--and clips Joshua Webster on the extra-point kick breaking his collarbone and knocking him out of the game. So David Childers must kick from now on.Next scoring drive ends: twenty-to-fourteen Giants as the Giants fail of their two-point conversion.Seven minutes left: the Giants get to fourth down and kick a field goal to extend their lead.Next play: double-blitz long. It ends with another TD and one-point conversion. Score: 23-21.Next drive: the Giants close to first-and-goal. Grant tells Brock Kelley to find his strength--and Brock shouts to his defensive team ""Stone wall!"" And so the Eagle defense under Brock's leadership make an incredible goal-line stand. And when Coach Duke refuses the field goal that sets up the Eagles to cause a fumble recover and return the ball to the Giants' thirty-four yard line!And then with a scant two seconds left to play Grant issues his final order: David Childers must kick a fifty-one-yard field goal. David doubts he can do this but Grant tells him once again to lay aside his fears. The sports announcers can't understand it especially since the wind is against David. But Coach Duke makes a mistake: he calls a time-out when he doesn't' have to. And then at the last second the wind shifts--and when David sees his father standing up in his wheelchair he moves in to make the kick.It is good.Final score: twenty-four to twenty-three Eagles.In the locker room Grant asks his players to dare tell him what's impossible with God. Answer: nothing of course. He singles out David for his field goal Zach for his quarterbacking and Brock for his defensive leadership.That night Brooke breaks to Grant some more joyous news that he hasn't heard yet: that he just ""made the Daddy team.""Two years later Grant Taylor with two State championship trophies on his wall has a year-old son (Luke Parr) who has his own model football field to play with--and Brooke obviously has another baby on the way."

"The Hamiltons seem to be an ordinary American family living in a small town in Northern California and dealing with the problems of everyday life. They've also been recently adjusting to the untimely death of their parents. David Hamilton the oldest has taken it upon his shoulders to pick up the responsibility for the orphaned family. Twins Wendell and Darlene are darker than the other two siblings and have become more conniving in the past few months. The youngest and most sensitive of the family is Francis. Francis recently found an old video camera his parents owned and is using it to work on a school project about his family. It's through Francis' eyes that we soon get to know the Hamiltons and realize that there are much more disturbing elements lurking below the surface of ""ordinary.""::Tulsa [edited]"
After the death of their parents the troubled teenager Francis and the corrupt twins Wendell and Darlene are raised by their older homosexual brother David Hamilton who sold the farm that belonged to the family. However the sensitive and confused Francis feels misfit with his siblings and misses his parents; he spends most of his time using a camcorder to film a supposed school project. When Wendell abducts the drifters Dani Cummings and her friend Samantha Teal he brings them to the cellar of his house. While David daily tortures until he kills Dani Francis sneaks in the cellar and befriends and feels sympathy for Samantha. When David is ready to kill Sam Francis rescues her and discloses the tragic secret of his evil family.::Claudio Carvalho Rio de Janeiro Brazil

Before the events depicted in the film Anne Elliott (Sally Hawkins) fell deeply in love with handsome young naval officer Frederick Wentworth (Rupert Penry-Jones) at the age of nineteen. But with neither fortune nor rank to recommend him Anne's godmother Lady Russell (Alice Krige) and family were against the match and persuaded her to break off the engagement. Eight years later Anne's family is in financial difficulty and has been forced to rent their home Kellynch Hall. Their tenants Admiral Croft (Peter Wight) and Mrs Croft (Marion Bailey) are brother-in-law and sister to Captain Wentworth. While Anne's father older sister Elizabeth (Julia Davis) and her companion Mrs Clay (Mary Stockley) travel to Bath to take a luxurious apartment Anne is sent to stay with her younger sister Mary (Amanda Hale) - a woman who perpetually fancies herself as ill and is as conscious of rank as her father and eldest sister.During her stay at Uppercross Anne again comes into contact with Captain Wentworth but although her feelings for him remain the same he seems determined to avoid contact with her. Anne is devastated to watch his apparent courtship of Louisa Musgrove (Jennifer Higham). During a trip to Lime to visit some fellow naval officers Louisa Musgrove falls and seriously injures herself. It is Anne who takes control and Wentworth realises that although he has been angry and resentful he has never stopped loving her.Unfortunately many people believe that Louisa and Wentworth have formed an attachment and an engagement is expected. Wentworth is no longer free to pursue his interest in Anne. In an effort to extricate him from the situation Wentworth goes to visit his brother hoping that Louisa's feelings and the family's expectations will diminish during the time he is away.Anne travels to Bath to stay with her father and Elizabeth. When she arrives Anne learns that Mr Elliot (her cousin and her father's heir) has reconciled with the family. He is spending a lot of time at Camden Place. Mr Elliot shows a great deal of interest in Anne much to Elizabeth's disgust. Lady Russell however is delighted; she envisions Anne taking her mother's place at Kellynch Hall as Lady Elliot.

A visit from Admiral and Mrs Croft soon informs her of the mistake. Louisa is to marry Captain Benwick one of Wentworth's friends.Wentworth comes to Bath to stay with Admiral and Mrs Croft.

"The movie opens on a working class street in an Irish/Italian Catholic neighborhood in the Bronx N.Y circa 1964
The pre-title establishing shots are of a quiet church garden with statues of saints and angels a Russian immigrant playing a zither a boy named Jimmy (Lloyd Clay Brown) being awakened by his mother for Sunday mass and then the title DOUBT.Jimmy races out of the house passed the Russian man who asks him for a paper and coffee but Jimmy can't stop because he is late for church and he's an altar boy on what looks like his first day serving mass.Jimmy makes it into the sacristy at his church and dresses into his cassock before starting to prepare the curettes of water and wine and incense all the things he needs to serve mass. Another altar boy Donald Miller (Joseph Foster) arrives for mass shortly thereafter. Donald is the first black student at the school. When Donald arrives he looks at himself in the mirror and asks Jimmy if he thinks he's fat. Jimmy doesn't think so and asks if Donald's clothes fit okay. Jimmy could care less whether anyone is fat but Donald is body conscious and checks himself out in the mirror unsure of himself.Father Flynn (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) delivers his sermon as Donald and Jimmy serve mass. The church is packed and we learn it's 1964 as Flynn talks about President Kennedy's assassination the year before and how that event was a tragedy everyone in the nation shares so in its way it brought people together because they all shared that event. The hopelessness and despair it created in everyone created a permanent bond between them and a spirit of ""we're in this together"" that should not be ignored.Sister James (Amy Adams) a quiet young nun sits in the pew listening intently to the sermon. She wears the archaic nun's habit: black dress black cape and black bonnet. As Flynn continues his sermon he talks about a man on a cargo ship that catches fire and sinks all the while he's looking to the starts to find a constellation to guide his way home. As he talks the camera scrolls through the church to the very back where more nuns sit including one who's watching all the children in church like a hawk. Spotting her prey this nun (face unseen) rises from her pew and walks over to smack a chattering boy (Michael Roukis as William London) in the back of the head and wake another boy who has fallen asleep. After she frightens the sleeping boy and makes him sit up straight in church we see this nun is Sister Aloysius Bouvier (Meryl Streep).Flynn finishes his sermon by talking about the crises of faith that sometimes enter into everyone's lives and that whenever people feel lost they should not feel alone because even the bravest and the most faithful have doubt from time to time.After mass Flynn is back in the sacristy as Donald changes out of his cassock and gets ready to go home. He tells Flynn when he grows up he wants to be a priest too. Flynn takes out a small toy - a little ballerina that dances when a mirrored magnet is applied to it. Donald is a very lonely boy who doesn't seem to have a lot of friends and it's obvious he admires Flynn a lot and looks up to him. Flynn gives him the toy obviously feeling sorry for Donald. (Throughout the movie it is emphasized at every opportunity that Donald is struggling partly because he is the only black student in the Irish/Italian Catholic School).The next day it's Monday in the convent and all the nuns wake up and dress for the day in their medieval habits. The students start to file into the building and London stops Sr. James and asks her what's going to be on the math test tomorrow and if there will be a lot of long division. Sr. James starts to turn away from him and he reaches out and grabs her arm. Sr. Aloysius sees this (it's against the rules to ever touch a nun as they are brides of Christ and no man should ever touch them) from her perch on stairs high above the schoolyard and she shouts ""BOY! Come smartly now and don't let me wait"". Flynn says to Sr. James ""The dragon is hungry"". London goes up to see Sr. Aloysius who takes unsmiling delight in disciplining the students she is clearly the Principal of the school.Sr. James has the 8th grade class and subjects are taught in periods. It's now history and Sr. James is covering the New Deal and FDR calling President Roosevelt President Lincoln and President Kennedy the three greatest presidents America has ever had. They're talking about FDR's ""Nothing to Fear but Fear itself"" speech as Sr. Aloysius enters the classroom patrolling the rows of desk to check for any contraband such as hair barrettes on the girls or transistor radios on the boys. She finds one boy Conroy with a wire running out of his ear and asks him what that is and Conroy a smartass says ""I don't know Sister. I don't know what it is."" ""You come with me BOY"" is Aloysius' reply and she takes him down to her office to confiscate the radio and make him write multiplication tables over and over again.There's a shot of choir practice for the Christmas pageant everyone is enjoying listening to the students sing except Sr. Aloysius who just sits there with a rock hard stoic joyless face.But that coldness is just a front as we see in the next scene where the nuns are all in their convent at dinner together. Sister Veronica sits next to Aloysius. Veronica is ancient well in her 80's and going blind. She can't find her fork to eat so Aloysius slyly slides it over to her reach never letting Veronica know she helped her. Aloysius takes care of Veronica like this through the whole movie trying to make sure none of the priests or the monsignor figures out Veronica is going blind (because then she would be taken away from the convent and forced to live elsewhere). Aloysius is established as taking care of her convent and her school with draconian measures when necessary.Sr. James chews a bit of meat that's too fatty and tries to spit it out but Aloysius makes her put it back in her mouth and eat it anyway so as not to waste food. She does this with just a well-placed look in James' direction.Aloysius has a bell she rings when she wants people's attention and she rings it and asks the nuns what they thought of Flynn's sermon on Doubt yesterday. She says something must have prompted it and is suspicious of Flynn thinking he must have done something to cause himself to have doubt and hence that inspired his sermon. She tells all the nuns to watch him and see what they can figure out.The next day it's lunchtime and Aloysius talks to Sr. James about London who faked a bloody nose so he could leave early and go smoke cigarettes on the street corner. The nuns are eating chicken chow mein and Sr. Veronica is missing her mouth and getting food on her habit and in her sleeves. Aloysius takes water and a napkin and cleans her up being loving and caring. She tells Sr. James not to let the children fool her and that if you pay attention you can tell when someone is deceiving you.Aloysius tells Sr. James that there is a chain of command to follow leading all the way up to the Pope. If Sr. James sees anything out of the ordinary or if the children do anything bad she needs to tell Aloysius who will take it up the chain.Aloysius inspects Sr. James' classroom throwing her cough drops out (because they are just candy by another name) and telling her to watch certain female students because she wants them to graduate as virgins so keep them away from the boys. She also lectures Sr. James because she finds a ballpoint pen on the floor and children are not supposed to write with them because it is bad for their penmanship. She also tells Sr. James to never open the windows and to mount a framed picture of the Pope on the wall so when she writes on the board she can look into the glass and all the kids will think she has eyes in the back of her head because she will be able to see everything they are doing.Flynn teaches gym class and instructs the boys in basketball. He also teaches them hygiene and tells them to always have clean nails.The priests are all shown having dinner eating lots of red meat laughing telling bawdy jokes and having fun. The nuns are shown at dinner and everything is dead silent where they drink milk and eat with perfect posture as Aloysius likes.Sr. James uses the Pope glass trick to catch London sneaking over to talk to a girl in class the one Aloysius said to keep away from the boys. Sr. James busts him and the class is stunned thinking she really does have eyes in the back of her head.Flynn calls Donald down to the rectory to see him and he leaves the class.Everyone else goes down for music/dance class where they learn the bossa nova. Sr. James notices Flynn putting a white tee shirt into a locker during the class. Donald has not rejoined the class yet.When they all go back upstairs to the classroom Sr. James asks Donald if he is okay and is clearly worried about him because something does not seem right.That evening Aloysius is doing chores in the garden covering the roses for winter. Sr. James tells her that Donald seemed strange after coming back from seeing Flynn. Donald has only been at school for 2 months and Aloysius asks if the other kids are picking on him since he is the first black student at St. Nicholas' school. Sr. James says that Flynn protects this boy and has taken an unusual interest in him.Aloysius: ""So it has happened. I asked you to come to me but I hoped you never would.""Seemingly out of the blue Aloysius assumes Flynn is molesting Donald though words like ""molesting"" ""sex"" or ""gay"" are never used in the movie. It's striking but the characters and audience know what everyone is talking about without the subject ever being clearly defined.As Aloysius and Sr. James talk a handyman interrupts them so they head into the convent where the cleaning woman is bringing a cat into the kitchen to catch a mouse she saw. Aloysius tells Sr. James to tell her everything she has seen.The film cuts to Flynn at a table with all the boys eating cookies and drinking lime soda talking about girls and asking them out on dates or asking them to dance. It looks like the 8th grade class of boys. One boy asks what happens if all the girls he asks to dance turn him down. ""You become a priest"" Flynn tells him.Sr. James tells Aloysius everything she saw: Flynn called Donald down to the rectory in the middle of class and was there for a while. He looked frightened when she next saw him. Aloysius says that she should have seen this coming because as the first black student Donald was isolated and easy prey for Flynn. She said that her job is to outshine the fox in cleverness. Sr. James says that it's all probably nothing and Aloysius asks her why she looks like she's seen the Devil then.Sr. James says she thinks she smelled alcohol on Donald's breath when he got back from the rectory. Aloysius says that all the priests will side with Flynn and that the nuns will have to stop him themselves. The cleaning lady walks through with the cat holding a dead mouse in paper towels. ""It takes a cat"" the cleaning woman says. ""Yes it does. Yes it does"" says Aloysius.The wind has been kicking up lately making branches fall in the garden. Wind plays a role in the film from here on out with lots of shots of leaves blowing and swirling around symbolizing the chaos swirling around the school.Conroy has been talking in class again. He is sent to the Principal's office where a giant sign reading QUIET greets visitors. Flynn comes over to ask why Conroy is waiting for the Principal but Aloysius comes out and quickly sends Conroy away she wants to talk to Flynn about Donald Miller. She tells Conroy to write multiplication tables 10 times and turn it in to her tomorrow.To meet with Flynn Aloysius requires elaborate rules of protocol. She can never be in a room alone with a man and must leave the door slightly open too. Sr. James arrives to chaperone the meeting.Aloysius has Sr. James serve tea and Flynn wants sugar. Aloysius makes a big deal about this as she considers it an indulgence and she gave that up for Lent last year and forgot about it. She has to look for the sugar in a drawer and when Flynn wants three lumps of sugar she ridicules his sweet tooth with the same scorn she has for ballpoint pens. She also thinks Flynn's fingernails are too long. When asked if Sr. James wants sugar she says NEVER because Aloysius is watching her.The ruse to get Flynn into the office to talk about Young is that Aloysius wants to talk about the Christmas pageant. Flynn wants secular songs in the pageant like Santa Claus is coming to town or Frosty the Snowman. Aloysius thinks Frosty is a pagan song advocating magic and should be banned from the airwaves. Both Sr. James and Flynn think Aloysius is crazy. Times are changing and they need to reach out to popular things to allow the children to connect with them. Aloysius says Christmas is about Christ; so all songs should be religious.Flynn gets an idea for a sermon on intolerance listening to Aloysius and he writes it in a little book with a ballpoint pen. Flynn tells Aloysius it is a new time and that something inside people has changed. He thinks they should sing songs from the radio take the kids out for ice cream and also take the boys camping. Flynn says religious people need to relate to the people in the working class neighborhood they are in. Aloysius says there's no way they can do that because religious people are different period.Getting onto what she really wanted to talk about Aloysius brings Donald Miller up and says they must be very careful how he will be used: can't hide him but can't put him right up front either because either way they would make him feel self conscious as the only black child in the school. Aloysius says they must be careful not to make him feel singled out because even Flynn himself singles Donald Young out for special treatment like that private meeting the two had last week.Aloysius plays cat and mouse with Flynn from this point out until the end of the film.She says Donald seemed strange when he returned to class after that meeting. Flynn asks if Aloysius wanted to talk about the pageant or about Donald Miller? He then tells Aloysius he is uncomfortable. The phone rings but Aloysius won't answer itit just rings and rings and rings making the room more tense. She asks Flynn what happened in the rectory and he tells her it was a private matter. He asks Aloysius what she is accusing him of. He gets up to leave and Aloysius says Sr. James smelled alcohol on Donald's breath. Flynn tells Aloysius to let this alone because it is not what she thinks --- Mr. McGinn (caretaker) caught Donald drinking wine in the back of the church. Flynn said he wanted to handle this quietly because if anyone else knew he would have to make Donald leave the altar boys. Sr. James is relieved because she says this explains everything including why Donald was acting strangely.Aloysius says it is easier to believe Flynn because Sr. James wants to believe him. She says ""these kinds of people are clever"" and she means ""child molester"" but never says that word. Sr. James says Aloysius just doesn't like him because he's jovial takes sugar in his tea likes popular music etc. She also says that she too likes Frosty the Snowman. Ask she says this the light bulb overhead blows out and Aloysius says ""You blew out my light"". She also says that in Ancient Sparta things were decided by who could yell the loudest and asks if that's what Sr. James is trying to do here.Aloysius calls Donald's mother and asks her to come in for a meeting.That next Sunday Flynn delivers a sermon on Gossip using a metaphor of a woman on a rooftop gutting a pillow and letting the feathers fly everywhere. He says stopping gossip is like putting all the feathers back into the pillowcase impossible to do so don't gossip. It bears false witness against neighbors ruins reputations and is a sin. Sr. James looks guilty. Aloysius just stares straight ahead unfazed.The next day in the courtyard Sr. James and Flynn watch a crow in a tree and talk about his sermon. Sr. James asks if the sermon was directed at anyone in particular knowing it was meant for Aloysius and her. Sr. James clutches a letter from home telling her that her brother in Maryland is very sick. Flynn smokes a cigarette enjoying another thing Aloysius does not approve of. Sr. James asks Flynn if ""it is true"" meaning did Flynn molest Donald Miller. She tells him she saw Flynn put Donald's undershirt into is locker. Flynn says he just left it in the sanctuary and that he was returning it and did not want to embarrass the boy by bringing it into the classroom so he just put it in the locker himself.Flynn says that Donald is a troubled boy that's why he drank the wine and that Donald needs compassion. Flynn says he cares about the students and that everyone needs compassion.The next day in school one of the girls comes up to Flynn and tells him she likes a boy. He is clearly the faculty member the kids feel comfortable coming to for help and advice. Flynn sees Donald approaching but this time he ignores and avoids him. Donald looks hurt. William London sees that Donald isn't being protected so he slams all of Donald's books and papers onto the floor. He also breaks the ballerina toy Flynn gave Donald. Flynn sees this and immediately comes over to help Donald pick up his things. He hugs and comforts Donald. Sr. James watches suspiciously.In history class Sr. James tries to get Donald to tell her what was Patrick Henry's famous remark but he does not want to talk. Another boy answers for him and Sr. James on edge sends him to the Principal's office for talking when he was not supposed to.Donald's mother is meeting with Sr. Aloysius who has been listening to the transistor radio she confiscated from a student earlier in the film. She's marveled by how small radios have gotten --- proof that her anti-tech/anti-change message doesn't always apply. She tells Mrs. Miller she likes to listen to the news all day and has always liked the news since she became addicted while her husband was in the war and she followed news reports all day. The husband died fighting and so she became a nun after that and kept up with the news after that. Mrs. Miller is surprised Sr. Aloysius was married.Mrs. Miller says she knows Donald was caught drinking wine and is happy Flynn watches out for him so other boys don't pick on him. Mrs. Miller has been concerned about Donald graduating and only wants her son to make it through June so he can go to a good high school where he will not be picked on.Mrs. Miller is late for work so Aloysius walks with her to her job. She comes out and tells Mrs. Miller that she is worried about Flynn making advances on her son. Mrs. Miller says there is no evidence of that and that maybe Aloysius is imagining it. She does not think Flynn gave her son altar wine and does not want any trouble. She keeps repeating that she just wants Donald to make it through June and graduate with no trouble.Aloysius tells Mrs. Miller that there are men like Flynn who chase after boys and Mrs. Miller says that maybe there are some boys that want to be caught. Without ever coming right out and saying it she tells Aloysius she thinks Donald is gay. She tells Aloysius that Donald's father beats him because of ""his nature"" and not because of things he does. His father does not want a gay son and has trouble dealing with Donald. Mrs. Miller says the reason she put Donald in private school was that the other boys were going to kill him in public school the kids don't like Donald his own father does not like him and Flynn was the only person ever good to Donald. She just needs Donald to make it to June and graduate. Just until June. She tells Aloysius to stop making trouble because Donald's father would kill him if Aloysius made a big deal about this if she wants to get rid of the priest then do it but leave her son out of it.Walking back to church Aloysius is caught in a big gust of wind and swept up in leaves in an approaching rainstorm just as he walks into the church to up the ante in her campaign against Flynn.Flynn comes to talk to her to tell her to stop that campaign against him. He tells Aloysius she has nothing more than unfounded suspicions while Aloysius accuses him of seducing Donald. He asks her why she says this and she tells him that she's looked into his past and that she ""knows people"" at his previous parishes. Just then the light bulb burns out overhead. Flynn says Donald's father beats him and that he needed compassion. Aloysius says she's had her eye on him since she saw him grab William London by the wrist once in the playground and she did not like that he touched the boy.Flynn asks her if she's serious and says she is imagining things. He takes out ballpoint pen and paper and says he is going to write down everything she says in case he needs it to have her removed from the parish later.Aloysius says she called his last parish and spoke to the nuns there and they told him all about the real reason he had to leave the parish. Flynn is angry and said Aloysius broke the chain of command because matters need to be handled by pastors then bishops then all the way up to the Pope while nuns take a vow of obedience and should not break the chain of command.Aloysius asks him again if he has seduced Donald Miller. Flynn asks her if she's ever done anything wrong and she says yes and then she confessed it. She also says a dog that bites is a dog that bites and needs to be dealt with so it does not bite again. She keeps asking him if he gave Donald Miller altar wine to drink. He won't answer and she tells him that she is going to leave the office now and that if he does not confess she will not stop pushing this until the truth comes out. Flynn stops her and says that he does not want this to get out.Aloysius says that Flynn will ask for a transfer and take a leave of absence and that no more harm will come to Donald. Flynn says he has done nothing wrong and only cares about Donald. He says he will fight Aloysius and she says ""You will lose"". ""Where is your compassion? he asks. ""Nowhere you can get to it"".She tells Flynn she has no sympathy for him and also that he needs to cut his nails.That next Sunday Flynn delivers his farewell sermon stepping down from the pulpit to shake the parishioners hands and say goodbye. He says there is a wind behind everyone pushing them through life and that now it is taking him away and that he will miss everyone. Aloysius and Sr. James are in the pews looking stoic. Donald Miller is sad and sheds a tear. Mrs. Miller is a mix of emotions.A few weeks later Flynn is long gone and Sr. James is back from visiting her brother who has now recovered. Sr. James says that Donald's heart is broken without Flynn and asks her if she was ever able to prove what she says Flynn did.Aloysius says she is sure she did the right thing while Sr. James says she can't sleep anymore because of all of this.Aloysius reveals instead of being disciplined Flynn was rewarded with a PROMOTION in an F-up/Move-up scenario: he was promoted to pastor of a larger church with a larger school. The Monsignor protected him and instead disciplined Aloysius for breaking the line of command and talking to nuns about Flynn instead of a pastor.Aloysius admits she lied and that she never called a nun she made that up but the lie would not have worked if Flynn had been innocent. She was sure Flynn molested boys so she pretended she talked to a nun about him to get a reaction out of him that would prove he was guilty: and she got the reaction she expected from him.She said his resignation from this church was his confession but Sr. James says it is wrong to lie and that Aloysius should not have done that.Aloysius says that in the pursuit of righting a wrong there is a price and that lie was the price they needed to pay to protect the boys of the parish.Sr. James can't believe Aloysius lied.Suddenly Aloysius breaks down and cries. She admits that even she has doubts ""such doubts"" she says.~george-venturino~"
A Catholic school principal questions a priest's ambiguous relationship with a troubled young student.::Anonymous
It's 1964 St. Nicholas in the Bronx. A charismatic priest Father Flynn is trying to upend the school's strict customs which have long been fiercely guarded by Sister Aloysius Beauvier the iron-gloved Principal who believes in the power of fear-based discipline. The winds of political change are sweeping through the community and indeed the school has just accepted its first black student Donald Miller. But when Sister James a hopeful innocent shares with Sister Aloysius her guilt-inducing suspicion that Father Flynn is paying too much personal attention to Donald Sister Aloysius sets off on a personal crusade to unearth the truth and to expunge Flynn from the school. Now without a shard of proof besides her moral certainty Sister Aloysius locks into a battle of wills with Father Flynn which threatens to tear apart the community with irrevocable consequences.::Miramax Films
Set at a Catholic school in the Bronx it centers on a nun who grows suspicious when a priest begins taking too much interest in the life of a young black student. Is she being overly protective or not protective enough? And can she work within the system to discover the truth?::Sherman (courtesy of Broadway.com)
In 1964 a Catholic elementary school has just admitted its first Black student a 12-year-old boy transferred from public school. The principal a rigid disciplinarian nun and the liberal parish priest are both concerned for the boy's welfare in a predominantly Irish/Italian parish. The nun becomes convinced that the priest has or is planning to have an improper relationship with the child and is determined to force him to leave the school. A third compassionate person is the boy's mother who has another point of view. The fourth person is a young teacher who is concerned but confused by the conflict between the nun and the priest.::jojo.acapulco@gmail.com
"Valkyrie opens with Colonel Stauffenberg in Tunisa North Africa (in 1943) penning in a journal his thoughts about World War II and how he feels Hitler is destroying Germany. Stauffenberg states he took an oath of allegiance to Hitler but feels he owes more to Germany. He argues with a general about holding a key city in a futile effort against the British and American forces. The general agrees to have the 10th Panzer Division moved to a different location where they can be evacuated back to mainland Europe. Shortly thereafter the camp is attacked by British aircraft and Stauffenberg is badly injured losing one of his eyes his right hand and two fingers from his left hand.The next scene shows Hitler visiting a base camp on the Eastern European Front and a nervous General Trescow looking on. As Hitler prepares to depart Trescow and an associate hide a bomb in a wine case and give it to a man on Hitler's plane but it fails to detonate in flight and Trescow must return to headquarters to retrieve it. Once he arrives he meets up with General Olbricht a fellow conspirator. Trescow safely retrieves the wine case and he and Olbrict discuss a member of their secret committee who was recently arrested. Trescow recommends that Olbricht contact Colonel Stauffenberg as a replacement which Olbricht does and brings Stauffenberg to one of their clandestine meetings.In the meeting Stauffenberg meets three of the most important figures in the resistance: Dr. Goerdeler who will become Chancellor of Germany should the plot succeed; General Beck who will lead the Armed Forces and a man named Witzleben. After tempers flare over the issue of what to do in the aftermath of the plot Stauffenberg agrees to help. At a later meeting Stauffenberg suggests they utilize Operation Valkyrie a plan that uses the Reserve Army to keep order among the Germany population should anything disrupt communications from Hitler or should Hitler be killed. Stauffenberg rewrites the order to exclude the SS from taking control which would leave the head of the Reserve Army General Fromm in charge of Germany. Reaching out to General Fromm Stauffenberg and Olbricht are surprised at his rejection but Fromm keeps quiet choosing to neither support the dissenters nor report them to the authorities.Meanwhile General Trescow is sent to the front lines. Stauffenberg is left in charge of the plan and he along with his assistant Lieutenant Haeften take the order to the Berghof to be signed off by Hitler himself. Hitler with his inner circle present praises Stauffenberg's loss of appendages as the attitude necessary for his military and states Stauffenberg is the ideal German officer. He then signs off on the bill saying he's sure the changes are adequate.Back at command Colonel Quirnheim shows the dissenters how to use pencil detonators and Stauffenberg persuades General Fellgiebel who controls communications at the Wolf's Lair to help. Stauffenberg has been promoted to General Fromm's chief-of-staff and thus has access to Hitler's military debriefings so the plan goes as follows: Stauffenberg and Haeften will travel to Hitler's bunker the Wolf's Lair to attend a military meeting. Stauffenberg will ignite one of the pencil detonators and then have Fellgiebel call and pretend to be a general pulling Stauffenberg out of the meeting while Haeften waits with a car. In theory Stauffenberg and Haeften will have six minutes to drive before the bomb detonates giving them time to return to the airfield and fly off before they can be suspected. The only condition the heads of the dissenters give however is that the both Himmler head of the SS and Hitler must be present for Stauffenberg to arm the bomb.Stauffenberg travels to the Wolf's Lair and has all preparations ready but notices Himmler is not present at the meeting and calls the committee to ask if he may proceed anyway. He is ordered to stand down by the committee unbeknownst to Olbricht who mobilizes the Reserve Army anyway. As Stauffenberg safely extracts himself and the bomb from the bunker the Reserve Army receives an order to stand down believing they were just running a training drill. Olbricht and Stauffenberg are ordered to report to General Fromm who is outraged that they would mobilize the army without his permission or knowledge. He warns them that if this happens again he will arrest them both.Dr. Goerdeler has a warrant issued for his arrest by the SS and General Beck implores him to leave the country. Goerdeler Stauffenberg's chief opponent on the committee hastily leaves and Beck grants Stauffenberg full discretion on how to proceed with the attempt. Colonel Stauffenberg visits his home and tells his wife his plan and that she and his children must leave because of their suffering at the hands of the Nazis if he should fail. They do so and Stauffenberg makes his next attempt on Hitler's life as he attends another military briefing on July 20 1944. Much to his surprise the meeting has been moved from Hitler's bunker to an open window summer hut. The blast would have been most effective in the pressurized bunker where the thick walls would deflect the pressure back to the bomb's origin wiping out everyone in the bunker. Stauffenberg plans to proceed anyway but then notices Himmler is once again not present. He calls the committee to ask permission to continue and they say 'no' but Stauffenberg and Quirnheim privately agree to continue anyway and Stauffenberg enters the summer hut. He and Haeften arm the bomb in a washroom and place it under the war room table as Haeften gets the car. Fellgiebel gives Stauffenberg his distraction phone call and Stauffenberg hastily leaves the hut.In the war room hearing news of the Germans' losses in Europe causes an enraged Hitler to bang his fist against the table knocking Stauffenberg's briefcase with the armed bomb inside over. A correspondent at the table sees Stauffenberg's fallen bag and moves it behind a table leg opposite Hitler. As Stauffenberg walks to his car the bomb detonates. Fellgiebel phones Quirnheim but poor reception keeps Quirnheim from fully understanding what has happened only hearing that the bomb has indeed detonated. Believing his job to be done Fellgiebel orders them to shut off all communications. Olbricht implores Quirnheim to phone back and find out if Hitler really is dead but the broken phone lines prevent that from happening. Olbricht refuses to mobilize the Reserve Army until he has received confirmation that Hitler has indeed been killed and leaves for lunch. Quirnheim issues the mobilization order behind Olbricht's back and the Reserve Army led by Major Remer mobilize in Berlin.Meanwhile Stauffenberg Haeften and their driver quickly make their way out of the Wolf's Lair and Stauffenberg cleverly tricks the soldiers into opening checkpoints for him. He makes it back to the airfield and quickly flies a plane back to the government district of Berlin.Much to Stauffenberg's shock the delay caused by Olbricht issuing the order could substantially set the effort back but they proceed with the plan as scheduled. They march to General Fromm's office and inform him that Hitler is dead and that he can either join their cause or be arrested. Fromm calls the Wolf's Lair whose communications has been restored and hears that Hitler is in fact alive. Stauffenberg dismisses this and asks Fromm whose side he's on. Fromm attempts to arrest Stauffenberg and Olbricht but is himself arrested instead. Stauffenberg Olbricht and Beck as heads of the Reserve Army under Operation Valkyrie give orders to arrest all the SS and Gestapo officers and seize control of Berlin. Major Remer follows these requests unaware that he is actually supporting the coup instead of fighting it as he believes. Eventually he reaches the SS headquarters in France. Contradicting orders have been sent one from the Wolf's Lair ordering the arrest of Stauffenberg and one from Stauffenberg ordering the arrest of Minister Joseph Goebbels. Goebbels shown slipping a cyanide pill in his mouth as he watches the Reserve Army approach picks up a phone and asks to be connected. Remer walks in and states that the man is under arrest but Goebbels gives Remer the phone. Remer hears Hitler's voice on the other line and is ordered by Hitler to release all the SS officers and capture those in charge of the conspiracy alive. Remer cancels the occupation of Berlin and marches towards Stauffenberg's location.Rumors are swirling that Hitler is alive which Stauffenberg dismisses as SS propaganda. But gradually Stauffenberg's associates in headquarters are either defecting or fleeing for their lives. As the Reserve Army reaches headquarters Stauffenberg Haeften Quirnheim Olbricht and Beck attempt to leave. After a brief shoot-out with loyalist soldiers Stauffenberg is wounded. He and all of the other conspirators are captured and General Fromm is released from his cell. Wanting to appear innocent in order to save himself Fromm orders the immediate arrest of the conspirators. In his office he condemns Stauffenberg Quirnheim Olbricht and Haeften to death but allows Beck to kill himself with a pistol.At midnight the remaining four are taken outside and executed by firing squad in the Bendlerblock. General Trescow upon hearing of the plot's failure is shown committing suicide on the front lines with a grenade. Goerdeler is shown executed by hanging and eventually Stauffenberg is brought before the firing squad. Quirnheim and Olbricht have already been executed and only Stauffenberg and Haeften remain. Stauffenberg is prepared to face his death when Haeften steps in front of him taking the firing squad's first shots in a final act of loyalty to his superior and falling dead. The firing squad reloads and aims at Stauffenberg who screams ""Long live sacred Germany!"" before being shot.Witzleben is shown publicly denouncing Hitler at his trial and the film reveals he too was executed on September 4 later that same year. Then the film states that General Fromm's hasty executions could not save himself and he too was executed on March 12 1945 for not reporting the conspirators.The film concludes with a byline announcing Hitler's suicide in April 1945 nine months later and reveals that Stauffenberg's wife and children survived the war."
A dramatization of the July 20 1944 assassination and political coup plot by desperate renegade German Army officers against Adolf Hitler during World War II.::Kenneth Chisholm

To this end Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg an Army officer convinced he must save Germany from Adolf Hitler is recruited to mastermind a real plan. To do so he arranges for the internal emergency measure Operation: Valkyrie to be changed to enable his fellows to seize control of Berlin after the assassination of Der Führer. However even as the plan is put into action a combination of bad luck and human failings conspire on their own to create a tragedy that would prolong the greater one gripping Europe.::Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com)

"Twelve black men with nothing in common except their race and destination board a Spotted Owl Bus in Los Angeles headed for the Million Man March in Washington DC.The African American men are:George (Charles S. Dutton) the trip organizer;Jeremiah aka ""Pop"" (Ossie Davis) a downsized 80-year-old senior citizen who is an expert on African-American history;Evan & Evan Jr. aka ""Smooth"" (Thomas Jefferson Byrd and De'Aundre Bonds) an estranged father and teenage son who are court ordered to be shackled together for 72 hours after Junior's arrest for petty theft;Kyle & Randall (Isaiah Washington and Harry J. Lennix) a gay couple in the midst of breaking up;Flip (Andre Braugher) a narcissistic and racist Hollywood actor;Gary (Roger Guenveur Smith) a LAPD officer who is half black and half white;Xavier (Hill Harper) a UCLA Film School student who is making a documentary;Jamal (Gabriel Casseus) a former gangster turned Muslim seeking redemption;Jay (Bernie Mac) a bubble gum company owner;Mike (Steve White) a conspiracy theorist who thinks the march is a plot to gather one million black men in one place for mass extermination.And then there is Craig (Albert Hall) the bus driver who is dealing with his teenage daughter's pregnancy.Note: three additional bus passengers are shown observing the action. They are credited but are not introduced nor are they given dialogue. They are Ja-Dee (Jadi McCurdy) a young man with dreadlocks; Doc (Hosea Brown III) a medical doctor; and Kahlid (Guy Margo) a member of the Nation of Islam.Along the way the men get to know each other and discuss various topics including their personal lives their political beliefs and even the recent O.J. Simpson murder case. In one of the few things that all of them have in common is their belief that even if Simpson was indeed guilty of killing his ""white ex-wife and a Jewish white man"" (which they continue to maintain that he didn't) it was right of him to be acquitted as ""payback"" for social racism against black people in America.The elderly Jeremiah (whom the men nickname ""Pop"") later reveals that after he lost his job he became an alcoholic and eventually lost his family. He hopes the March will revitalize him and inspire him to turn his life around.Evan Jr. who fancies himself as a gangster rap artist named 'Smooth' manages to escape from his father at one point. Evan Sr. finds Junior and realizes that Junior's criminal behavior was an attempt to gain his attention after he became neglectful. He expresses regret and promises to make a sincere effort to be there for Junior.Xavier who refers to himself as ""X"" begins interviewing the passengers with his video camera a narrative device which allows each of the passengers to reveal information about their lives and how they perceive themselves and the March. Xavier captures as much as he can on his camcorder but the group often dismisses the earnest amateur filmmaker as ""Spike Lee Jr.""Tensions rise after Xavier's interview with Flip who spends most of his time bragging about his own sexual prowess and who seems more concerned with getting a film role opposite Denzel Washington than the purpose of the March. Flip reveals himself to be a bigot homophobic and racist provoking the gay couple Kyle and Randall for being homosexuals and Gary for being biracial. This leads to further conflict when Gary reveals that he is a police officer working a beat in South Central Los Angeles two things for which he has faced criticism and ostracism from other African Americans his entire life. Gary proudly recalls his father a black policeman who was gunned down in the line of duty by black street gang members; an incident that Gary credits with his decision to become a police officer.Gary's revelations about his life and career spur Jamal to reveal that he is an ex-Crip gang member who converted to Islam and began work with a community outreach program that works with children to discourage them from becoming involved in gang activity. In a tense conversation the two debate over the causes of gang violence and the limits of repentance and forgiveness: Jamal confesses that while he was a Crip he committed murder and rape crimes for which he was never arrested or punished. Following Jamal's confession Gary informs him that he will be arrested upon their return to California.Next Kyle reveals that he is a 1991 Gulf War veteran who was purposely shot by his own platoon because of his race and sexual orientation. Being gay African-American and Republican he feels persecution from all sides which has made him bitter. Although they are having problems in their relationship Randall tries to comfort his lover but makes a point of outing Kyle when he refuses to talk. Kyle is harassed further by the homophobic Flip who mocks him claiming ""Oh my God a gay black Republican now I have seen everything!"" with additional homophobic statements rants. Flip also picks on Randall for his effete gay mannerisms following Kyle's outing. A heated argument between Flip and Kyle turns violent when Flip punches Kyle. In the resulting fistfight Kyle is victorious and Flip is embarrassed.During the trip the bus breaks down and the group boards a new bus. Craig runs off to return to Los Angeles after being contacted by his daughter who has gone into labor. The new bus driver is Rick (Richard Belzer) a white man who is ethnically Jewish. Eventually he feels the need to speak out against Louis Farrakhan's Anti-Semitic statements that Jews are a ""gutter"" people and that not all Jewish people are white. Rick talks about his parents' and other Jews' participation in the 1960s Civil Rights Movement but George along with some members of the group fight back using Jewish stereotypes.At a rest stop Rick quits the trip in protest telling George: ""I wouldn't expect you to drive the bus to a Ku Klux Klan meeting!"" George becomes confrontational and angrily accuses Rick of being a racist for not supporting the march in spite of Farrakhan's own racist remarks against both white and Jewish people (while at the same time refusing to acknowledge that Farrakhan ever made them). Although Rick maintains that he is not a racist George refuses to accept this. George begrudgingly agrees to disagree with Rick and lets him depart although he refuses to look at Rick when Rick wants to shake his hand before he leaves. George drives the bus for the rest of the trip with help from Evan Sr. who while not licensed a bus driver has experience driving trucks.The group meet various people at rest stops including fellow travelers White American Southerners (who to the group's surprise are friendly) and women (both black and white with whom Flip tries to flirt). At a diner the group meets Wendell (Wendell Pierce) a Lexus car salesman who bribes his way onto the bus despite pleas from George to travel to the March on his own since taking on board a passenger without a ticket could potentially jeopardize his job. On the route Wendell reveals that he too is a Republican and his reason for going to the March is to sell cars. He decries liberal blacks such as Jesse Jackson who believe that it is the government's responsibility to make their lives better using successful and conservative blacks such as Colin Powell as examples that black men can ""make it"" in society. His rhetoric quickly comes to be accused as racist from the others even Kyle however as he disparages several people on the bus as being ""niggers"" after which the other passengers literally throw him out of the bus.While driving through Knoxville Tennessee the bus is pulled over by Tennessee state troopers (one of whom is played by Randy Quaid in an uncredited cameo). They are stopped on suspicion of drug trafficking and searched with drug-sniffing dogs despite the pleas of Gary who shows his LAPD badge to the troopers. The troopers ignore Gary and continue with the search however they do not find anything illegal and permit the bus to continue on its way.As the bus approaches Washington D.C. Xavier discovers Jeremiah slumped over and unconscious in his seat. They rush him to a hospital and watch the beginning of March on television as they await word on Jeremiah. A doctor later informs the group that Jeremiah has died of heart disease. The men are shocked and saddened by Jeremiah's death. They end up watching the rest of the March from the hospital... never making it to Washington to partake in the March. George tells the men that the March should be seen as merely the beginning of a larger movement.In the final scene in front of the Lincoln Memorial George leads the men in a prayer that Jeremiah wrote before his death.

"New York City fall of 1965: Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse (Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes) are a young married couple who rent an apartment in the gothic and splendorous Bramford building in Manhattan. At first their friend and current landlord Edward ""Hutch"" Hutchins (Maurice Evans) tries to dissuade them from doing so: the building has a rather unsavory past. It has been occupied by cannibal killers Satanists and witches such as the Trench Sisters Keith Kennedy Pearl Ames--and the sinister Adrian Marcato who created a scandal in the late 1890s by claiming to have conjured ""The Living Devil.""Rosemary and Guy decide to move in anyway. Guy is an actor with a fledgling career. He's done plenty of TV plays and commercials which have made him good money; but he wants great parts. Rosemary is a gentle soul originally from Omaha Nebraska where she had been raised in a Catholic home and had attended convent school.As it is Rosemary is estranged from her family since they don't accept her marriage to Guy who is not only an actor but is also of mixed Jewish/Protestant upbringing. So her life in New York is all she has: she is a young housewife dedicated entirely to making a good home for her husband whom she adores. She has a good circle of friends but is at core sweetly naïve and lonely.One day in the laundry room Rosemary makes the acquaintance of Terry Gionnoffrio (Victoria Vetri) a young former drug addict who was ""rescued from the gutter"" by an elderly eccentric couple Roman and Minnie Castevet (Sidney Blackmer and Ruth Gordon). The Castavets's apartment had formerly been the front part of theirs but is now separated by a partition.Her friendship with Terry is short-lived. A few days after Rosemary meets her Terry plunges to her death from the bay window. She and Guy are walking home when they see the police surrounding Terry's corpse. The Castavets happen to be walking home too. Presumably distraught they strike up an acquaintance with the Woodhouses and later invite them to dinner. Rosemary becomes suspicious about their new elderly friends particularly the way that Roman insists on speaking with Guy in private. Other things trouble her too such as when Guy's career gets a jump start when his main rival Donald Baumgart suddenly goes blind. Now all he cares about is his new play.But then suddenly he decides he wants to become a father. Rosemary is thrilled.Evidently having studied her ovulation cycle himself he announces the ideal ""baby night."" That evening Minnie drops by to give them some chocolate mousse--or mouse as she calls it. Rosemary complains of a chalky undertaste but Guy gets angry over her ingratitude. She eats part of it and then furtively hides the rest in her napkin.Suddenly feeling disoriented after dinner she passes out and has a bizarre dream. Rosemary is floating on a mattress in the sea visits a cruise ship with the Kennedy's has her wedding band removed is carried through the Sistine Chapel a brief shot of the linen closet with guy saying ""easy you got her too high"" then she's back on the cruise ship naked and told by the skipper go below the deck and passes by a burning church and lays down on a mattress. The unsettling dream becomes a nightmare when she finds herself surrounded by naked elderly people a statue figure of a bearded man staring down at her and two men tie her to a bed. Then Jackie Kennedy soothes her for not feeling well. Guy approaches her bed but then something that looks and feels inhuman brutally rapes her. ""This is no dream!"" she cries. ""This is really happening!"" Pope Paul VI then visiting NYC and having mass at Yankee Stadium comes to offer her absolution.When she wakes up Rosemary is sore and scratched. Guy half-heartedly apologizes for having had her while she was out. Rosemary is angry but ""baby night"" later proves successful. Dr. C.C. Hill (Charles Grodin) -- referred to her by her girlfriend Elise Dunstan (Emmaline Henry) --
confirms it.Upon hearing the news the Castevets persuade Rosemary to go to Dr. Abraham Sapirstein (Ralph Bellamy) a prominent obstetrician who delivers all the babies of the upper class in the city. Rosemary entrusts herself to him accepting his odd advice and his recommendation of Minnie's strange ""vitamin drinks"" which include a rare herb tannis root. She develops pain during her first trimester which causes her to lose weight and look emaciated alarming Hutch--but not the doctor Guy the Castevets or their Saturday night gang of quaint old timers including Dr. Stan Shand (Phil Leeds) and the obnoxious Laura-Louise McBurney (Patsy Kelly).As her pregnancy progresses Rosemary feels a mounting sense of dread and angst especially since no one close to her seems to want to acknowledge her pain. She decides to throw a party for her young friends a qualification she insists upon. She also insists that they not invite the Castavets. Her girlfriends -- including Elise Joan Jellico (Marianne Gordon) and Tiger Hoanigsen (Wende Wagner) -- tell her she looks awful and that her pain is far from normal. She has to see a new doctor. Rosemary tells Guy and they fight bitterly over it. But at the last minute she relents. The pain has suddenly stopped. And now she can feel the baby kicking.Rosemary's friend Hutch drops by for a visit; Roman and Minnie spot him and suddenly Guy arrives home unexpectedly as if they'd phoned him and urged him to rush back to the apartment. Hutch asks a lot of questions of Roman and Guy and before he leaves the apartment he realizes he's misplaced one of his gloves. Later Hutch falls into a mysterious coma and dies. Rosemary receives a book from Hutch's companion Grace Cardiff (Hanna Landy) which Hutch had intended to give to Rosemary personally. It's called ""All of Them Witches"" a study on witchcraft through the ages featuring a chapter on Adrian Marcato (his appearance is familiar from the ""dream"") and his son Steven. ""The name is an anagram"" is the final clue Hutch had left for her. Rosemary uses her Scrabble tiles to learn the horrible truth: ""Roman Castevet"" is an anagram for ""Steven Marcato.""Now she suspects Roman Minnie and all their all-too-helpful friends are Satan worshipers. She visits Dr. Sapirstein and tells him she'll have no more to do with them. It's just as well Sapirstein informs her: Roman is dying and would like to go away to Europe on a farewell tour. Rosie feels guilty about her suspicions and when the time comes bids them a fond farewell.But not all is what it seems. As her due date -- June 28 1966 -- nears she learns one strange thing after the other. Could it be that Guy is involved with witches? Witches use babies for their rituals. Has he promised them the baby? She also learns that witches use the belongings of their intended victims to blind or kill them. On a hunch she contacts Guy's former rival Donald Baumgart and gets him to reveal that Guy swapped ties with him just before he went blind.Distraught Rosemary packs a suitcase and goes to Dr. Sapirstein to tell him what she's learned. But his secretary's off-hand remark reveals something horrible -- the good doctor sometimes smells like tannis root which she has learned is more commonly called Devil's Pepper. Dr. Sapirstein is a witch too and must be part of the plot against her. Next Rosemary persuades Dr. Hill to see her. When she reveals her suspicions to him he seems to take her seriously and he gives her a sedative to help her sleep but she is horrified when she awakens and find that Guy and Dr. Sapirstein have arrived to take her back home and Hill is unwilling to stop them seeming frightened of them. She manages lock them out of the apartment but before she can call for help Guy and the others appear in the apartment having entered by some other means. Rosemary tries to fight them off and she goes into labor. They have to force her down on her bed while Sapirstein injects her with something to make her sleep.When she wakes Guy tells her she has had a boy and that he's fine. But later Sapirstein tells her that the baby is dead. The coven members sit with Rosemary collecting her breast milk and she thinks she can hear a baby crying through the walls of the apartment. She knows they have taken the baby and she thinks they are planning to sacrifice it for one of their rituals.After a few days of pretending to cooperate and take her sedatives Rosemary arms herself with a sharp butcher knife and finds the partition between her apartment and the apartment of the Castavets. Removing the closet interior she finds the hidden doorway to the other apartment and goes inside. She looks at an oil painting of a burning church whispering ""you got her too high"" apparently having a flashback of the ""dream"". She discovers the entire coven sitting in the living room around a bassinet including Minnie and Roman. A photo of Adrian Marcato is up above the mantle. There are other people there too that Rosemary does not recognize people that seem to have come from as far away as Japan. She approaches the bassinet which is adorned with an inverted cross and sees the baby for the first time (not shown to the audience) horrified that the baby has strange eyes. ""He has his father's eyes"" Roman tells her and the coven tells her that Satan is the baby's father not Guy. Guy finally tells her that he made an agreement with the coven to allow them to impregnate Rosemary with the spawn of the Devil in exchange for a successful acting career. Rosemary spits in his face but sink into a chair totally beaten. Minnie brings her a cup of tea. Roman speaks more gently to her and encourages her to be the baby's mother and does not need to join their evil coven. Although Rosemary hesitates at first her maternal instincts win out and the film ends as she rocks the baby's cradle and sings to him."

"New Zealand was used as a hub for American Marines waiting to be shipped out to fight in the South Pacific during WWII; and this movie tells the story of four ""kiwi"" sisters and their romantic entanglement with American servicemen.Joan Fontaine plays the oldest sister (nicknamed ""Iceberg Anne"" by Evelyn). Anne started as the unsympathetic old maid who looked down on all local girls who threw themselves at the American soldiers then ended up falling in love with Charles Drake's down-to-earth Captain Dick Bates.Jean Simmons plays the second sister Barbara a widow who finds herself drawn to the cynical Captain Jack Harding played by Paul Newman. Jack is in charge of investigating marriage requests submitted by marines ensuring that the lonely boys are not infesting the USA with ""undesirable"" women; hence he does not believe in having romantic relationship with any women. Barbara is in love with Jack but does not want to see herself becoming Delia and another one of ""those girls."" Their feelings for each other grew strong and against their better judgments they begin an ""almost"" love affair for a few months and then Jack sets sail to join the other marines fighting in the South Pacific.Piper Laurie plays Delia - the black sheep of the family (and the actress with the least screen time). Her endless string of love affairs with American servicemen while her husband rots away in an POW camp eventually leads to her own death and a scandalous murder trial. Ironically this is also what finally brought Barbara and Jack back together.Sandra Dee plays the baby sister Evelyn the only sister who ended up marrying a local boy after he returns home from war. Evelyn's role provides comic relief in this movie being the typical 15-going-on-30 teenager and making smarty-pants comments on the ups and downs of her older sisters' love live."

A searing portrait of war and prejudice 'Only the Brave' takes you on a haunting journey into the hearts and minds of the forgotten heroes of WWII - the Japanese-American 100th/442nd. In 1941 when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor overnight Japanese Americans were put into internment camps for the duration of the war. Determined to prove their loyalty 1400 Japanese Americans successfully petitioned the government to serve becoming the 100th Infantry Battalion. They were sent to North Africa Italy and finally France were they performed an impossibly-dangerous rescue of the Texas 36th Division. During their two years of combat these men received an unparalleled 21 Medals of Honor 9486 Purple Hearts 8 Presidential Citations 53 Distinguished Service Crosses 588 Silver Stars and 5200 Bronze stars - making them the most decorated unit of their size in American military history. This is their story.::Randolph Kret
"In 1941 when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor there were 5000 Japanese Americans serving in the U.S. Armed Forces. Overnight these second-generation citizens were stripped of their official duties - simply because they looked like the enemy. On the mainland 120000 innocent men women and children were rounded up and swept into remote internment camps where they would remain behind barbed wire for the duration of the war. Determined to prove their loyalty the discharged Hawaiian Territorial Guardsmen of Japanese descent successfully petitioned the U.S. government to allow them to serve. These 1400 Hawaiian Nisei (second-generation Japanese-Americans) became the 100th Infantry Battalion. In July 1943 after rigorous training they were sent to North Africa then Italy. Fiercely courageous they suffered so many casualties the 100th was soon dubbed the ""Purple Heart Battalion."" In June 1944 they were joined by the 442nd - comprised of Nisei volunteers from the internment camps and Hawaii - and proceeded to liberate five towns in Northern Italy. That September they were shipped to Southern France and freed three more towns before being recruited for what would become one of the top ten most important battles of World War II - the impossibly-dangerous rescue of the Texas ""Lost Battalion."" Two hundred and seventy-five men of the Texas' 36th Division had been trapped for more than a week on a high plateau in France's Vosges Mountains surrounded by 7000 experienced German soldiers. Allied planes tried dropping them food and ammo but the supplies kept rolling out of reach down the ridge. When attempts by much larger regular-Army units failed to break through the 100th/442nd was ordered to finish the job. Though their ranks were already decimated and the Nisei were unimaginably exhausted they spent four days and nights in brutal uphill hand-to-hand combat - while suffering frostbite and trench foot so severe they could hardly walk. The Nisei saved 211 out of the 275 Texans but suffered more than 800 casualties of their own. During two years of combat their extraordinary valor resulted in an unparalleled 21 Medals of Honor 9486 Purple Hearts eight Presidential Citations 53 Distinguished Service Crosses 588 Silver Stars and 5200 Bronze Star Medals - making them the most decorated unit of their size and length of service in American military history.

"On the evening of May 8 1776 in Philadelphia as the Second Continental Congress proceeds with its business. John Adams the widely disliked delegate from Massachusetts is frustrated because none of his proposals on independence have been debated on by congress. The other delegates implore him to ('Sit Down John')Adams' response is that Congress has done nothing for the last year. He goes outside and in song ('Piddle Twiddle and Resolve') he reads the latest missive from his loving wife Abigail who their home in Braintree Massachusetts appears in his imagination. He asks if she and the other women are making saltpeter for the war effort but she ignores that and states the women have a more urgent problem: no straight pins. They pledge their love to each other in song ('Till Then').The next day Adams finds delegate Benjamin Franklin outside. Adams bemoans the failure of his arguments for independence. Franklin suggests that a resolution for independence would have more success if proposed by someone else. Richard Henry Lee of Virginia enters on horseback having been summoned by Franklin. The cocky Lee crows that he is the best man to propose the resolution. Adams has reservations but Lee is convinced he cannot fail as a member of the oldest and most glorious family in America ('The Lees of Old Virginia') He is prepared to ask the Virginia House of Burgesses to authorize him to offer a pro-independence resolution.On June 7 1776 Franklin and Adams enter and the delegates along with the President of Congress John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson take their places. Hancock gavels the 380th meeting of the Congress to order.The entire New Jersey delegation is absent. Thomas Jefferson a young delegate from Virginia announces that he is leaving for Virginia that night to visit his wife. Soon after Hancock opens the floor to new resolutions Richard Henry Lee canters into the chamber having finally returned from Virginia. Lee reads his resolution but John Dickinson of Pennsylvania moves to indefinitely postpone the question of independence. A vote is taken. Six colonies vote in favor of debate. Five vote to postpone indefinitely and thus kill the proposal.The New Jersey delegate arrives and the vote now stands at six for independence and six against (with New York abstaining ""courteously"") and Adams reminds Hancock (who supports independence) of his privilege as president to break all ties. Dickinson then moves that any vote for independence must pass unanimously on the grounds that ""no colony may be torn from its mother country without its own consent."" The vote produces the same tie which Hancock breaks by unexpectedly voting for unanimity (prompting an angry outburst from Adams). He reasons that without unanimity any colony voting against independence would be forced to fight on England's side setting brother against brother.Adams thinking fast calls for a postponement of the vote on independence expressing the need for a declaration defining the reasons for independence. Franklin seconds Adams but when asked why such a declaration should be written both are lost for words until Thomas Jefferson provides them himself: ""to place before mankind the common sense of the subject in terms so plain and firm as to command their assent."" The vote on postponement is called producing yet another tie with New York abstaining ""courteously"" yet again. Hancock breaks the tie by voting in favor of postponement. He appoints a committee of Adams Franklin Roger Sherman of Connecticut Robert Livingston of New York and Jefferson to draft the declaration. Hancock adjourns the session over Jefferson's complaints that he must go home to his wife.The Committee of Five argues about who should write the declaration ('But Mr. Adams'). Adams declines Franklin's suggestion that he do so. Adams asks each of the others in turn to be the drafter but each demurs: Franklin argues that he is not a political writer only a satirist; Sherman claims that he is not a writer at all but ""a simple cobbler from Connecticut""; and Livingston must return to New York to celebrate the birth of his son.All eyes then turn to Jefferson. Jefferson tries to wriggle out of the responsibility pleading that he has not seen his wife in six months. Adams unmoved by Jefferson's arguments (as he too misses his own wife) quotes a passage of Jefferson's Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms bluntly telling Jefferson that he is the best writer in Congress. Jefferson accepts the duty of drafting the document.A week later Adams and Franklin visit Jefferson to see how the work is coming along. Jefferson has spent the week moping prompting a sharp rebuke by Adams which is flatly rebuffed by Jefferson. Finally Jefferson is brightened when his beloved wife Martha enters (Adams has sent for her). The two older gentlemen leave the young lovers in peace. Adams alone again exchanges letters with his wife Abigail. They pledge each other to be eternally ('Yours Yours Yours'). Martha finally appears when Franklin and Adams return the next morning and the two gentlemen ask her how a man as silent as Jefferson won a woman as lovely as she. She tells them that she loves him ('He Plays the Violin').On June 22 1776 Congress has reconvened. By now Adams is worrying and begins trying to win over some of the states sending Thomas McKean to try to convince his Delaware colleague George Read and Franklin to convince James Wilson of Pennsylvania while himself trying to convince Samuel Chase of Maryland.The remaining delegates in favor of independence also leave the chamber. Alone with his fellow conservatives for the first time Dickinson leads them in a minuet singing of their desire to hold onto their wealth and remain ('Cool Cool Considerate Men'). During their dance/song another dispatch comes from George Washington warning them of British advances on Philadelphia; however these warnings fall on deaf ears.After the dance number the remaining delegates depart leaving Andrew McNair (the custodian) the courier and a workman in the chamber. The workman asks the courier if he has seen any fighting and the courier replies that his two closest friends were killed on the same day at Lexington. He describes the final thoughts of a dying young man as his mother searches for his body ('Momma Look Sharp').Jefferson is outside the chamber as Mr. Thomson the secretary reads the declaration to Congress. Adams and Franklin meet him delightedly: an exhibition of shooting by the Continental Army has convinced Samuel Chase and Maryland will vote in favor of independence. They congratulate Jefferson on the excellence of the document and Franklin compares the creation of this new country to an egg ('The Egg'). This leads the trio to debate which bird is breaking out of its metaphorical shell and would best represent America. Franklin tries to coax them into choosing the turkey but the three settle on the eagle as insisted upon by Adams.On June 28 1776 Hancock asks if there are any alterations to be offered to the Declaration of Independence leading many delegates to voice suggestions. Jefferson acquiesces to each recommendation much to Adams's consternation until Dickinson demands the removal of a phrase calling the King a tyrant. Jefferson refuses stating that ""the King is a tyrant whether we say so or not. We might as well say so."" When Thomson comments that he has already scratched the word out Jefferson orders him to ""scratch it back in."" When one delegate wants references to Parliament removed for fear of offending possible friends in that body an exasperated Adams exclaims ""This is a revolution damn it! We're going to have to offend somebody!""Edward Rutledge of South Carolina objects to a clause in the Declaration condemning the slave trade accusing the northern colonies of hypocrisy and telling them that the prosperity of the North depends on the Triangle Trade ('Molasses to Rum') to slaves as well. When this clause is not removed the delegates of the Carolinas and Georgia walk out of Congress. The resolve of the other delegates is broken and most of them also leave. Franklin tells Adams that the slavery clause must go; when Adams quarrels with him Franklin angrily reminds Adams that ""the issue here is independence!"" and berates Adams for jeopardizing the cause. Adams' faith in himself is shaken and only encouragement from Abigail (and the delivery of kegs of saltpeter from her and other Massachusetts ladies) bolsters his commitment ('Compliments').Re-reading the dispatch from Washington Adams now alone in the chamber echoes his words in song ('Is Anybody There?') Discouraged but determined Adams declares his vision of his new country: ""Through all the gloom through all the doom I can see the rays of ravishing light and glory!"" Dr. Lyman Hall of Georgia unexpectedly returns to the chamber. He tells Adams ""In trying to resolve my dilemma I remembered something I'd once read 'that a representative owes the People not only his industry but his judgment and he betrays them if he sacrifices it to their opinion.' It was written by Edmund Burke a member of the British Parliament."" Hall then walks over to the tally board and changes Georgia's vote from ""nay"" to ""yea"".It is now July 2 1776. The delegates slowly return to the chamber including Caesar Rodney of Delaware who had earlier left Congress due to poor health. Hancock calls for the vote on the Lee Resolution. Thomson calls on each delegation for its vote. Pennsylvania passes on the first call but the rest of the northern and middle colonies (save New York which with some self-disgust again abstains ""courteously"") vote ""yea"". When the vote reaches South Carolina Rutledge again demands the removal of the slavery clause as the condition of the ""yea"" votes from the Carolinas. Franklin pleads with Adams to remove the clause (""First things first John ... Independence. America. If we don't secure that what difference will the rest make?"") and Adams turns to Jefferson. Jefferson reluctantly crosses the chamber and scratches out the clause himself. Rutledge and the Carolinas vote ""yea"" as does Georgia.Pennsylvania's vote which is the last vote needed to obtain the required unanimous approval is called again Dickinson declares that ""Pennsylvania votes..."" only to be stopped by Franklin who asks Hancock to poll the members of the delegation individually. Franklin votes ""yea"" and Dickinson ""nay"" leaving the swing vote to Wilson who normally adheres to Dickinson. Seeing his hesitancy Dickinson tries to entice him: ""Come now James ... the issue is clear."" Franklin remarks that ""most issues are clear when someone else has to decide them"" and Adams mercilessly adds that ""it would be a pity for a man (Wilson) who has handed down hundreds of wise decisions from the bench to be remembered for the one unwise decision he made in Congress."" Wilson doesn't want to be remembered as ""the man who prevented American independence"" and votes ""yea"". The motion is passed.The next day on July 3 Hancock suggests that no man be allowed to sit in Congress without affixing his signature to the Declaration. Dickinson announces that he cannot in good conscience sign such a document and still hopes for reconciliation with England. However he resolves to join the army to fight for and defend the new nation. Adams leads the Congress in a salute to Dickinson as he leaves the chamber.The next day Hancock leads the delegates in signing the Declaration but is interrupted by the courier with another dispatch from Washington ""Commander of the Army of the United Colonies ... of the United States of America."" He reports that preparations for the Battle of New York are under way but expresses concern about America's badly outnumbered and under-trained troops. Washington's note to Lewis Morris that his estates have been destroyed but that his family has been taken to safety emboldens Morris to state that he will sign the Declaration despite the lack of instructions from the New York legislature saying ""To Hell with New York. I'll sign it anyway."" New York's vote is moved into the ""yea"" column.On the evening of July 4 1776 McNair rings the Liberty Bell in the background as Thomson calls each of the delegates to sign their names on the Declaration of Independence. The delegates freeze in position as the Liberty Bell rings to a fevered pitch."
A musical retelling of the American Revolution's political struggle in the Continental Congress to declare independence.::Kenneth Chisholm
"The film version of the Broadway musical comedy of the same name. In the days leading up to July 4 1776 Continental Congressmen John Adams and Benjamin Franklin coerce Thomas Jefferson into writing the Declaration of Independence as a delaying tactic as they try to persuade the American colonies to support a resolution on independence. As George Washington sends depressing messages describing one military disaster after another the businessmen landowners and slave holders in Congress all stand in the way of the Declaration and a single ""nay"" vote will forever end the question of independence. Large portions of spoken and sung dialog are taken directly from the letters and memoirs of the actual participants.::Dave Heston <heston@iName.com>"
Despite or because of the state of the Revolutionary War led by General George Washington the Second Continental Congress meeting in Philadelphia has long skirted the issue of independence from Great Britain much to the chagrin of its chief proponents Massachusetts Congressman John Adams and Pennsylvania Congressman Dr. Benjamin Franklin. Adams knows that much of the debate is against him as a person many who see him as being obnoxious and a blow-hard. He decides a more judicious approach may be to work behind the scenes rather than be front and center in the fight as he has been. On June 7 1776 Adams gets Virginia Congressman Richard Henry Lee to propose a motion in Congress to debate the issue which finally passes. However when the vote for independence finally looks like it will pass its chief opponent Pennsylvania Congressman John Dickinson manages to pass a motion that any vote for independence needs to be unanimous. As a delay tactic Adams initiates a successful motion to postpone the vote for three weeks to July 2 1776 until they can vote on the actual text for a declaration of independence - his assertion is how can they vote on something that does not exist. Adams and Franklin talk a reluctant Virginia Congressman Thomas Jefferson to be the one to draft the document. Jefferson's reluctance is that he has other more personal issues on his mind.

"After a textual montage summarizing Edgar Allan Poe's life the film begins in late September 1849 with Poe awakening from a hallucination where he is buried alive. He prepares to take a trip to New York City via Baltimore. He discusses his plans to marry his childhood sweetheart Sarah Elmira Royster with a stranger taking the same steamboat who suggests he meet with a few potential investors for his planned magazine 'The Stylus'. Though Poe had intended only to pass through he agrees to meet the investors who one by one turn down his request for funding.Poe is depicted as having some type of memory loss offering to pay his boat fare twice after forgetting he had already paid. In Baltimore he more than once forgets the arrangements he has made at his hotel as his stay in the city is extended. One night he chooses to dine in a local tavern rather than at the hotel. There he meets an old friend from his days at West Point. In desperation he asks his former classmate and the classmate's companion for money to help start a magazine saying proudly he has already raised $1000. Poe leaves the tavern to retrieve his prospectus for the magazine. His classmate and friend follow him out where they beat him up to steal the $1000 he had collected leaving him in an dirty alley.An injured and delirious Poe is then found by organizers of a cooping ring. The author along with several others are forced to multiple polling locations around Baltimore to place multiple votes for the candidate for mayor. A couple of victims of the scam die amidst the brutality of their captors.Afterwards Poe is released and eventually collapses in the street where he is found by a local tavern owner. The man calls for Poe's uncle Henry Herring and Dr. Joseph Snodgrass. The men discuss what to do with the incoherent half-conscious Poe. Snodgrass assumes that he is drunk and suggests they let him sleep it off (a theory that seems to dispute by showing him early in the film declining offered alcohol several times). Herring becomes more concerned and demands Poe be taken to Washington College Hospital despite the expense of the establishment.At the hospital Dr. John Moran tends to Poe unable to accurately determine his situation or the cause of his failing health. He muses to his wife Mrs. Moran that he does not want to be known as the physician who killed Edgar Allan Poe. Moran denies Poe visitors and his Baltimore cousin Nielson Poe is convinced his cousin is about to die. Poe ultimately does die after one final hallucination or perhaps a flashback where he sees his dead wife Virginia Clemm.

"Shortly after moving to Los Angeles with his parents 17-year-old Jim Stark (James Dean) enrolls at Dawson High School. In the opening scene Jim is brought into the police station for public drunkenness. When his mother father and grandmother arrive at the police station to retrieve him conflicts in Jim's family situation are introduced as he explains to the arresting officer. His parents are often fighting. His weak-willed father (Jim Backus) often tries to defend Jim but Jim's picky and domineering mother always wins the arguments for his father cannot find the courage to stand up to his wife. Jim feels betrayed both by this fighting and his father's lack of moral strength causing feelings of unrest and displacement. This shows up later in the film when he repeatedly asks his father ""What do you do when you have to be a man?""The next day while trying to conform with fellow students at the school he becomes involved in a dispute with a local bully named Buzz Gunderson (Corey Allen). While Jim tries to deal with Buzz he becomes friends with a shy 15-year-old boy John who is nicknamed Plato (Sal Mineo) who was also at the police station the night of the opening scene for shooting and killing puppies. Plato idolizes Jim as a father-figure much to Jim's concern. Plato tells Jim that his parents divorced several years ago and are never in Los Angeles. His mother lives away in her hometown and never visits calls or writes while his father (a wealthy business executive) is always traveling and avoids comming home leaving only his housekeeper to look after Plato. Plato experiences many of the same problems as Jim such as searching for meaning in life and dealing with his absent and selfish parents who ""don't understand.""In the school hallway Jim meets Judy (Natalie Wood) whom he also recognizes from the police station the previous night where she was brought in for being out alone after dark who originally acts unimpressed by Jim saying in a sarcastic tone ""I bet you're a real yo-yo."" She is apparently the property of Buzz. Judy too has an unhappy homelife when it shows her before going to school when she deals with her unattenative and sexist father who gives all his attention to Judy's younger brother as well as ignors both Judy and his wife for he feels that women are ment only to serve him and nothing more.That afternoon Jim goes on a field trip with his science class to the Griffith Observatory. At the Planetarium he watches a dramatic presentation of the violent death of the universe. After the show he watches Buzz and his thugs slash a tire of his car for no reason and then Buzz challenges him to a knife fight while the gang taunts Jim as a ""chicken."" Jim reluctantly takes part in the fight and wins subduing Buzz by holding his switchblade up to his neck before discarding both knifes off a railing. Both Jim and Buzz get slight injuries during the knife fight. Not to be outdone Buzz and his thugs challenge Jim to a ""Chickie Run"" with Buzz and Jim racing stolen cars towards an abyss. The one who first jumps out of the car loses and is deemed a ""chicken"" (coward).That evening the ""game"" is held with Judy and several students in attendance to watch. But the race ends in tragedy for Buzz when a strap on the sleeve of his leather jacket becomes looped over a handle on the car door preventing him from jumping out before the car goes over the cliff.Jim runs home and tries to tell his parents what happened but quickly becomes frustrated by their failure to understand him and storms out of the house. Jim goes to the police to find the sergeant who took his statement the previous night to tell him about the accident involving Buzz's death but learns that the police officer is not there. Jim refuses to speak to any policeman and will speak only to the sergeant and he leaves. But Jim is spotted leaving the station by three of Buzz's friends Crunch (Frank Mazzola) Goon (Dennis Hopper) and another one of Buzz's gang members whom is not named. Mistakenly thinking that Jim told the police about the ""Chickie Run"" they decide to hunt Jim down to ""silence him""... permenently.Jim meets up with Judy and they go to an abandoned mansion to hide out. Plato finds them there (he was the one who told Jim about the house). There they act out a ""fantasy family"" with Jim as father Judy as mother and Plato as child. However Crunch Goon and the other boy soon discover them and terrorize Plato who finally brandishes his mother's handgun that he took from the house shooting Crunch and at Jim and a police officer who investigates in a clearly unstable state.Plato runs and hides in the Observatory which is soon besieged by the police. Jim and Judy follow him inside and Jim convinces Plato to lend him the gun from which he silently removes the ammunition magazine. When Plato steps out of the observatory he becomes agitated again at the sight of the police and charges forward brandishing his weapon. He is fatally shot by a police officer as Jim yells to the police too late that he had already removed the bullets. Plato was wearing Jim's jacket at the time and as a result Jim's parents (brought to the scene by police) think at first that Jim was shot. Mr. Stark then runs to comfort Jim who is distraught by Plato's death. Mr. Stark promises to be a stronger father one that his son can depend on. Thus reconciled Jim introduces Judy to his parents and they drive off together as dawn starts to break."

John McCabe who largely lives off what he is able to win in gambling has just rode into the relatively new mining town of Presbyterian Church nestled in the mountains of Washington. He is an intimidating figure to most of the men in town in large part because of his quiet bravado and the belief they have that he is a gunslinger who recently killed a man. With his money McCabe opens up some businesses catering to the men in town including a whorehouse and bathhouse the former which he sets up with a trio of cheap hookers he purchased from nearby Bear Paw. Shortly thereafter cockney Brit Constance Miller also arrives into town she a whore herself who makes a proposition to McCabe that she run the whorehouse and bathhouse to her exacting high standards on a fifty/fifty partnership basis with him a proposition which McCabe eventually accepts. Mrs. Miller is able to make a successful go at the businesses despite her penchant for opium of which McCabe is unaware. The businesses are so successful that the Harrison Shaughnessy mining company sends two of its representatives to Presbyterian Church to buy all McCabe's holdings in town. McCabe turns them down before he learns from much more streetwise Mrs. Miller that there is a steeper price to pay for going against Harrison Shaughnessy. As such McCabe may have to use those gunslinging skills he purportedly possesses not only to save his and Mrs. Miller's businesses but his life as well.::Huggo

This fact-based courtroom drama examines the international tribunal that assembled in war-torn Nuremberg Germany following World War II to try various German officer for war crimes and atrocities. Led by American Justice Robert Jackson the assembled team must first put together the courtroom then question captured Nazis to determine who should be tried and ultimately select 21 individuals to stand trial. Initially opposed to execution Jackson became more accepting of the sentence as he learned of the severity of the heinous acts that occurred. The 21 Nazis led by Hitler's second-in-command Hermann Göring try to take control of the courtroom. However their bravado fails as the graphic films show the heinous acts that had occurred. Some of the film's dialog is taken directly from court transcripts.

"One morning in November 1951 Sonny Crawford (Timothy Bottoms) and Duane Jackson (Jeff Bridges) co-captains of the dismal high school football team in the small dying town of Anarene Texas shrug off insults about the team's last game of the season. Sonny relaxes with his friends Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson) the aging but still vital cowboy who owns the small town's cafe pool hall and movie theater and Sam's ward the mute gentle simple-minded Billy (Sam Bottoms).Sonny and Duane have breakfast at the cafe run by salty-tongued waitress Genevieve (Eileen Brennan) and discuss their usual Saturday night plans of seeing the ""picture show"" and necking with their girl friends in the pickup they jointly own. Sonny goes to work and that night while Duane and his blonde girl friend Jacy Farrow (Cybill Shepherd) take the first turn in the pickup Sonny joins his girl Charlene Duggs (Sharon Taggart) in the theater. The unpleasant and bickering Charlene complains that Sonny has forgotten their one year anniversary but Sonny is more interested in watching Jacy the most beautiful and wealthiest girl in town as she and Duane come into the theater and begin to kiss. Sonny and Charlene then take their turn in the pickup but the frustrated Sonny longing to do more than fondle Charlene's breasts ends their stale relationship when she becomes petulant. Later at the cafe Genevieve comforts Sonny and wonders why both he and Duane live in a boardinghouse rather than with their parents.At basketball practice one afternoon Coach Popper offers to get Sonny excused from class the next day for driving the coach's wife Ruth (Cloris Leachman) to her doctor's appointment and Sonny agrees. That night Jacy is confronted by her alcoholic mother Lois (Ellen Burstyn) who does not want her daughter to waste her youth as she did. When Lois advises Jacy not to marry Duane and instead sleep with him to learn that there is ""nothing magic about it"" Jacy is shocked.Then next day Sonny arrives at Coach's home to pick up Ruth and the shy woman is disappointed to see that her husband has not come himself. During the return trip Sonny is nonplussed by Ruth's tears although she tells him that there is nothing seriously wrong. Afraid to be alone Ruth invites Sonny in for a soda but her continuing sobs unsettle him even more although he timidly tries to comfort her.Another few days later at the town's annual Christmas dance Lester Marlow (Randy Quaid) one of Jacy's country club friends asks her to come to a nude swimming party at the home of wealthy Bobby Sheen (Gary Brockette). Eager for excitement Jacy consents then schemes on how to end her date with Duane. Perturbed to see Lois dancing with Abilene (Clu Gulager) the oil driller with whom Lois is having an affair Jacy lures Duane to the pickup. There Duane gives Jacy a lavish Christmas present and Jacy hoping to distract him places his hand under her skirt before announcing that Lois had ordered her to attend the swimming party with Lester. Meanwhile Sonny helps Ruth clean up and while they are outside they engage in a passionate kiss and agree to meet soon.In the nearby town of Wichita Falls Lester introduces Jacy to Bobby and his crowd of sexually adventurous friends and Jacy eager to attract Bobby's attention strips on the diving board and finally jumps into the pool fully naked and joins the group.Back at Anarene Duane suggests to the other boys that they ought to buy a hooker for Billy so that he will not die a virgin. Sonny's attempts to stop them are unsuccessful and soon Billy is in the back seat of a car with local waitress Jimmie Sue who angered by Billy's fumbling bloodies his nose with a massive punch.The group returns Billy to Sam's pool hall and while Sam questions them Duane hides. Upon hearing what the boys have done Sam condemns their ""trashy behavior"" and bans them from entering his businesses. Duane pretends to have fallen asleep in the car and as the weeks pass continues to patronize Sam's establishments while Sonny stays away and is lonesome for Sam whom he admires deeply as well as Billy and Genevieve.In the meantime Sonny begins an affair with Ruth although during their first encounter at her house Ruth is so horrified by the loud squeaking of the bed springs that she cannot enjoy herself.Several weeks later Sonny enters the cafe one night and Genevieve while reprimanding him for his treatment of Billy allows him to stay. She attempts to caution him about his affair with Ruth which is common knowledge but Sonny remains silent. Sam and Billy enter and after Billy joyfully greets his friend Sam forgives the repentant youth.Another afternoon later on New Year's Eve Sam takes Sonny and Billy fishing and reminisces about a time 20 years earlier when he brought a young lady friend swimming at the same spot. Although he and his paramour were in love she was already married and Sam lost her. Meanwhile in Wichita Falls Jacy attends another party at Bobby's where the arrogant young man asks if she is a virgin.

Upon their return a few days later on January 3 however the boys are shocked to learn that Sam has died from a sudden heart attack during their absence.

Upon their return however Abilene treats Jacy coldly and when she sees her mother Jacy breaks into tears. As Lois is comforting her she mentions Ruth and Sonny's relationship and Jacy who was unaware of Sonny's liaison is intrigued as she knows about Sonny's crush on her.Determined to win Sonny away from Ruth Jacy begins to date him and promises that eventually they will spend the night together.

Eagerly anticipating having sex with Jacy Sonny acquiesces but after they are married and are driving home Jacy reveals that she left a note for her parents detailing their plans. Sonny is crushed when they are stopped by a patrolman and Jacy is driven home by her furious father who arranges for the marriage to be annulled but Jacy who wanted only to heighten her notoriety is pleased.

Both dreading and needing to see his friend before he ships out for Korea Sonny finds Duane and asks if he wants to attend the picture show as Miss Mosey is being forced to close it due to lack of business. Duane agrees and the boys spend a companionable evening watching the last movie.In the morning Duane admits that if he had married Jacy her father would have forced them to get an annulment too. After Duane leaves on the bus Sonny is in the pool hall when he hears the screech of brakes in the street and rushes outside to discover that Billy has been hit and killed by a trucker who did not see him but then drove away from the scene in a hit-and-run. Grief-stricken Sonny lashes out at the gathered men who deride Billy as a simpleton then drags his friend's body to the sidewalk where he carefully covers him.In the final scene Sonny then drives to Ruth's house where the surprised woman admits him but then upbraids him for breaking her heart. Although Ruth tells Sonny that he has ruined what was between them when he tenderly takes one of her hands she caresses him in return and tells him ""Never you mind honey. Never you mind."""

"The film begins with a brief summary of the Northern Legion Trading Company stating that each spring a party from the fort traveled to Hudson Bay to trade pelts for winter provisions but in 1815 the party never returned. This is when the story begins....The year is 1897 over 100 years before the first 'Ginger Snaps' movie. Brigitte and Ginger are lost with their horse in the rugged Canadian wilderness when they come across a seemingly abandoned camp that bears signs of a violent attack. They then notice an elderly Indian woman who tells them that she too had a sister once and gives Ginger and Brigitte each a necklace with a bird's skull that belonged to her and her sister. The woman speaks of them as the red and black and warns that unless they ""kill the boy"" one sister will kill the other. Suddenly the girls' horse is startled and flees; they try to chase it but Brigitte's foot gets caught in a trap set by an Indian hunter. Ginger goes back to the camp to find the Indian woman but the hunter arrives before Ginger returns. The girls view him as a threat until he releases Brigitte and leads them to Fort Bailey where they take refuge. Ginger claims they are the daughters of a trader who drowned seeking passage East. The men there are suspicious of them but the sisters are permitted to stay.The fort has been under siege by werewolves for some time. The sisters are taken to the doctor Murphy who inspects Brigitte's wound. Murphy applies a leech surreptitiously testing to see if a werewolf bit her. As nothing happens to her Wallace knows they're safe. The sisters are still treated with suspicion particularly by Reverend Gilbert who views the girls as temptation and harbingers of sin. They are given a room that belonged to James's son Geoffrey and informed he is dead along with James's Indian wife. There are toy wolves and soldiers in the room set up to be fighting each other.That night Ginger is awakened by a voice and goes to investigate. Wandering the corridors she eventually finds the source of the voice and enters a small bolted unlit room; reaching out to a deformed boy who turns and bites her as he flees.Ginger and Brigitte try to leave the fort but one of the men James confronts them. While Ginger and James are fighting werewolves attack killing one of their men. The sisters are led by Reverend Gilbert to an allegedly safe building which actually contains a werewolf.

As Ginger sleeps he sneaks into the bedroom and wakes her. She tries to grab him but he gets away taking a lock of her hair. One of the men investigates the noise and is killed by Geoffrey. The others find the body with the lock of Gingers hair beside it and drag Ginger away while James holds Brigitte captive. Wallace arrives dismisses James and makes a deal with Brigitte; her sister's life in exchange for their silence regarding his son. Wallace and Brigitte find Ginger at the doctor's strapped to the examination table and held at gunpoint about to be tested with a leech. When Wallace demands they release Ginger Murphy ignores the order and approaches Ginger with the leech. Wallace shoots him dead prompting the other men to leave.Ginger is determined to kill the boy to lift the curse but when she traps Geoffrey he escapes and is captured instead by the men. Wallace arrives and kills his son himself. The sisters' protection at an end Ginger is forced to leave and Brigitte goes with her. Desperate for a cure the sisters go to the hunter's cave Ginger killing their guide shortly before they arrive.At the cave the hunter and Indian seer woman reveal the sisters' coming had long been prophesied and that the Red and the Black would decide the destiny of the werewolf bloodline. After Brigitte is put in a trance-like state she has a vision of her destiny; she sees the hunter attempting to kill Ginger and then kills her sister herself.

Gilbert goes to her telling her to beg forgiveness to save her soul; Brigitte curses spitting in his face. Gilbert drags her out onto the parade square and prepares to burn her alive. He is interrupted by Wallace who runs Gilbert through with his sword before setting him on fire. James engages Ginger in a fight and she slashes his throat. As he falls to the ground bleeding to death Ginger opens the gates and ushers in all the werewolves who immediately attack and kill two of the men. Wallace is soon bitten and sets the fort on fire before killing himself. The hunter urges Brigitte to kill her sister; instead Brigitte kills the hunter and flees with her sister.The film ends with only Ginger and Brigitte left alive huddled in the snow in the woods back where the movie began.

"Indian scout Tom Jeffords (James Stewart) is sent out to stem the war between the Whites and Apaches in the late 1870s. He learns (through an uncomfortably close encounter) that the Indians kill only to protect themselves or out of retaliation for white atrocities. Befriending the sagacious Apache leader Cochise (Jeff Chandler) Jeffords ensures safe passage for white mail-carriers through Indian territory. As he becomes closer to his Native American ""brothers"" Jeffords falls in love with and weds a pretty Apache girl (Debra Paget). This being a 1950 film (miscegenation was frowned upon by the Production Code) you can guess what happens to her. Jeffords wants to avenge his bride's death at the hands of white renegades but it is the so-called ""savage"" Cochise who advises him not to. Having learned much from each other Jeffords and Cochise symbolize the white/Indian detente with the traditional broken arrow. This superb non-condescending film has been criticized in some circles because of the alleged depiction of Cochise as an Indian ""Uncle Tom"" and because actor Jeff Chandler was not a genuine Native American. Nonetheless Broken Arrow stands the test of time far more successfully than the later politically correct Dances with Wolves. In 1956 Broken Arrow was adapted into a TV series starring John Lupton as Jeffords and Michael Ansara as Cochise."

Ex-soldier Tom Jeffords saves the life of an Apache boy and starts to wonder if Indians are human after all; soon he determines to use this chance to make himself an ambassador. Against all odds his solitary mission into Cochise's stronghold opens a dialogue. Opportunely the president sends General Howard with orders to conclude peace. But even with Jeffords's luck the deep grievance and hatred on both sides make tragic failure all too likely.::Rod Crawford <puffinus@u.washington.edu>
Based on the real-life efforts of Tom Jeffords this film dramatizes his efforts to make peace with Apache chief Cochise. After helping a young Indian boy Cochise sets Jeffords free leading him to think that there may be a way to make peace in the war that has now lasted nearly 10 years. He takes time to learn their language and customs and then sets out to see if they can get safe passage for the mail riders who are always being ambushed. He succeeds developing a mutual respect with the Apache leader. Not everyone is in favor of the deal with some settlers as well as Apaches refusing to go along and intent on doing what they can to break the peace. Jeffords pays a high price because of those efforts but his perseverance did lead to several conflict-free years.::garykmcd
"In a rare meeting of fact and fiction ""Broken Arrow"" portrays the efforts of the actual former Union captain Tom Jeffords to restore peace between white frontiersmen and Cochise's Chiricahua Apaches after a long decade of ferocious and incessant war. Tired of the endless hostilities Jeffords strongly believes that there is still hope for peace between both sides through honest and meaningful dialogue--and with this in mind--he manages to mediate a peaceful resolution of the conflict in 1872. But sadly this is a fragile treaty and now it's up to the wise Indian chief to put an end to the intoxicating vengeance--wherever it comes from.::Nick Riganas"

After several years on the ship Max leaves and tells the story of 1900 to the owner of a music store.::grantss

He has only a Conn trumpet which he sells for less than he had hoped. Clearly torn at parting from his prized possession he asks to play it one last time. The shopkeeper agrees and as the musician plays the shopkeeper immediately recognizes the song from a broken record matrix he found inside a recently acquired secondhand piano. He asks who the piece is by and Max tells him the story of 1900.
Shortly after the Second World War Max a transplanted American visits an English pawn shop to sell his trumpet. The shopkeeper recognizes the tune Max plays as one on a wax master of an unreleased recording discovered and restored from shards found in a piano salvaged from a cruise ship turned hospital ship now slated for demolition. This chance discovery prompts a story from Max which he relates both to the shopkeeper and later to the official responsible for the doomed vessel for Max is a born storyteller. Though now down on his luck and disillusioned by his wartime experiences the New Orleans-born Max was once an enthusiastic and gifted young jazz musician whose longest gig was several years with the house band aboard the Virginian a posh cruise ship.

After Danny's death in an accident 1900 remained on the ship. Increasingly lured by the sound of the piano in the first-class ballroom he eventually became a gifted pianist a great jazz improvisationist a composer of rich modern music inspired by his intense observation of the life around him the stories passengers on all levels of the ship trusted him enough to tell. He also grew up to be a charming iconoclastic young man at once shrewd and oddly innocent. His talent earned him such accolades that he was challenged by and bested Jelly Roll Morton in an intense piano duel that had poor Max chewing paper on the sofa in agonies of suspense. And yet for all the richness and variety of his musical expression he never left the ship except almost once in the aftermath of his infatuation with a beautiful young woman immigrant who inspired the music committed to the master Max discovers in the pawnshop. Max realizes that 1900 must still be on the ship and determines to find him and to find out once and for all why he has so consistently refused to leave.::GMBaxter

"This closely follows a true account of Cold War US black-ops in South America preceding Operation Condor launched by Augusto Pinochet in Chile following the 1973 CIA-orchestrated coup against President Allende and his death by probable assassination. Costa-Gavros also directed Missing a film about this event starring Jack Lemmon and Sissie Spacek.The historical figure played by Yves Montand in State of Siege was Dan Mitrioni a former Indiana police chief working in Montevideo within USAID's Office of Public Safety which in fact was training civilian police in kidnapping torture and assassinations of suspected Communists parallel to School of the Americas training of South American military personnel. The film opens with the American found dead in the back of a car. We subsequently learn how and why this came about. The Tupamoros a popular Uruguay insurgency that robbed the rich and gave to the poor had captured and interrogated the American ""trainer"" at length about his actions and motivations. The captive-captors interactions that take the form of a trial are the heart of the film revealing the motives and objectives of the insurgents and the defensive rationalizations underlying violent American interference in Latin American governments. The American never breaks and confesses so they are left with no alternative but to execute him for his many capital crimes.Both Contra-Gavras films provide important history lessons that Americans receive from neither their schools nor their media. Missing was a major box office success but State of Siege provides the clearest understanding of US Cold War operations and their impacts on targeted societies."
Using the interrogation of a US counterinsurgency agent as a backdrop the film explores the consequences of the struggle between Uruguay's government and the leftist Tupamaro guerrillas.

But Cynthia hasn't even been invited round there after a year. So all round she feels rather lonely and isolated. Meanwhile in another part of town Hortense adopted at birth but now grown up starts to try and trace her mother.::Jeremy Perkins {J-26}
Following the passing of her adoptive mother London based optometrist Hortense Cumberbatch believes it is a good time to find out the identity of her birth mother something that is now the right of adopted adult children in Britain which was not the case when she was given up for adoption in 1968. Her biological mother's name is Cynthia Purley the most shocking news among the adoption papers for Hortense being that Cynthia is white while Hortense is black. Despite the questions Hortense has for Cynthia she isn't sure what to do with any of the information. If Hortense does proceed with contacting Cynthia she will find that she is walking into a firestorm of dysfunction that exists between members of the Purley family. Cynthia an uneducated factory worker who on first thought wouldn't even remember sleeping with a black man has only two blood relatives: her younger brother Maurice Purley who owns a successful photography business and her daughter Roxanne Purley who works for the council as a street cleaner. Roxanne on the cusp of her twenty-first birthday is an angry and unambitious young woman most of that anger directed at her mother. She treats Maurice like the father she never had - her biological father's identity which Cynthia has never told her - and thus Maurice's wife Monica Purley like the mother she wished she had. Maurice and Monica can treat Roxanne like a daughter especially since they have no children of their own. Controlling Monica has made Maurice cut day-to-day ties with Cynthia due to Monica seeing Cynthia as flighty and irresponsible that view in part because of Cynthia getting pregnant when she was fifteen with who ended up being Hortense. No one has ever told Roxanne that she is Cynthia's second child. That severing of ties means that Maurice and Monica have not invited either Cynthia or Roxanne to the new house they've owned for a year redecorating it to her exacting standards being Monica's focus in life. The question then becomes what will happen between Hortense and Cynthia not if but when Hortense contacts her which she has decided to do and how that will affect the interpersonal relationships between all the family members now including Hortense.::Huggo

"Set in 1930s southern India against the backdrop of a growing nationalist movement Before the Rains is the English language début of Indian director Santosh Sivan. An idealistic young Indian man (Rahul Bose) finds himself torn between his ambitions for the future and his loyalty to the past when people in his village learn of an affair between his British boss (Linus Roache) and a village woman (Nandita Das).
Before the Rains is adapted from Red Roofs the longest of three unrelated stories in the Israeli director Dany Veretes 2002 film Yellow Asphalt which explored the collision of modern customs and tribal traditions in contemporary Israel. In that movie a wealthy Jewish farmer who has an affair with his Bedouin housekeeper forces his assistant a Bedouin tribesman to initiate drastic damage control once the relationship is detected. With a screenplay by Cathy Rabin Before the Rains has been to moved to colonial India in 1937. The transition from one culture to another is seamless.
Moores played by Mr. Roache with a cunning charm that masks an authoritarian severity is carrying on a passionate affair with his housekeeper Sajani (Nandita Das) a beautiful naïve woman who commutes from the village to work at his nearby ranch. One afternoon they are accidentally spied making love at a waterfall by two young boys from the village who report seeing Sajani with an unidentified man.
When her husband Rajat (Lal Paul) interrogates her Sajanis evasive replies drive him into a fury and he savagely beats her which under tribal law is within his rights. Since Mooress wife Laura (Jennifer Ehle) has recently arrived from England with their son Peter (Leopold Benedict) Sajani has already become someone to be kept hidden although Moores still swears he loves her.
But when Sajani shows up wounded at his door in the middle of the night he insists she leave as soon as possible. The next day he hands her money and entrusts her to T. K. who is ordered to make sure that she leaves. Before departing she asks Moores one last time if he loves her and after a pause he coldly answers no.
Before the Rains doesnt dawdle in sentimentality. As much as you sympathize with Sajanis hopeless plight she is a pariah with nowhere to go the film is a dispassionate study of how power when threatened ruthlessly exercises its prerogatives. For as long as he can get away with it Moores lies to his wife about the reasons for the escalating turmoil. Nowadays its called stonewalling.
The movies most compelling figure is the unfailingly loyal T. K. who is instructed to violate native customs in a desperate cover-up. A stoic taciturn man who loves his boss too much he is a lost soul who has foolishly imagined he could keep one foot in the tribal world and the other in the modern.
But for all his ability at navigating between the two T. K. is as naïve in his way as Sajani. The movie is too sophisticated to make Moores an evil caricature. He is simply the embodiment of the kind of power that when endangered reveals its true nature. The serenity and calmness of the locations are charming and the background score is impressive.(updated March27 2009 by swati-verma@hotmail.com)"

Reminiscent of Richman Poorman this movie plays like a greek tradgedy with no happy endings. A tale of two brothers that fill stereotypical roles of one brother favored with a half full indulgent take on life balanced with a younger brother that radiates impending doom. Tough and often wrong decisions pepper this movie and lead the viewer to believe for a moment it might be possible for a happy ending. A final decision at the end of the movie leaves the viewer with more questions than answers. Opinion: Eric Roberts would have been perfect for the role of 'the indian runner'.

She inquires exactly what the family crisis is about. Joanna ""Jo"" Morgan (Jill Haworth) really feels distraught because of the bad blood against their father. Alex admits that it's because Ben is a dying man and also because she got a letter from him accusing his second wife Elizabeth Hall Morgan (Julie Harris) of poisoning him. Alex thinks that they shouldn't let her murder somebody ""again"". If it were not for that she would be the first not attending the funeral and letting his new wife to bury him on her own.The four of them need to speak to Ben.

Freddy has turned to booze and pills to cope while Jo has little to no thoughts of family in her partying ways. Chris the youngest is the innocent who can only take her sisters' word as to what was going on being too young at the time to fully comprehend what was happening. Alex as the oldest who they all turn to in times of need and then the rest of the girls return to their isolated rural home on their now elderly father's request on Christmas Eve he who has reinstated them in his will. Largely bedridden he believes that Elizabeth is slowly trying to poison him to death and he wants the girls to stop her in any way they can including killing her if need be. Elizabeth is unaware of the true reason why Benjamin has convened his daughters at this time. His belief is partly due to the fact that Elizabeth was charged but acquitted of the murder of her first husband he who died from what is officially listed as suicide from self-induced poisoning. What happens between the girls under the circumstance is largely affected by their ""roles"" within the family. Shortly after the girls' arrival a torrential storm passes through the region leaving them stranded as the one and only road to the property is washed out and the phone lines are knocked out.

Pete used to work for Wilfred Buckley until a professional disagreement led to Pete deciding to start his own consulting business Wilfred who is now a friendly rival for the same pool of clients. During what is a midterm election year Pete has among his clients: Washington Governor Andrea Stannard who is being attacked by her main opponent for her personal home situation rather than her politics; wealthy New Mexico gubernatorial candidate Wallace Furman whose main obstacles to an election night win are not being a native New Mexican and having little personal charisma; and Roberto Cepeda a Presidential candidate in a strife and violence-ridden but oil-rich South American country.

The issue which she believes doesn't pass the smell test is the reason for Hastings' retirement. Pete and Ellen divorced not because they didn't love each other but because their respective jobs left them little time to have an actual relationship. Through this election cycle Pete may get a different perspective of his work and of his clients in particular especially when he learns that an unknown someone is monitoring his every move without coming right out and telling him so.::Huggo
"Opening narrative by Dr Donald Stanton (Herbert Marshall) describes an experimental launch and return of a rocket test. Men then race in jeeps across a desert searching for the instrument pack thats returned to Earth. They find the pack and approach in radiation suits to retrieve the device.
At a scientific meeting Dr Stanton discusses how metal fragments from the rocket have changed during the flight. Dr Jane Flynn (Martha Hyer) suggests that the metal has weakened because of exposure to cosmic rays. Shes puzzled how meteors survive such conditions for millions of years. The mention of meteors sparks an idea for Stanton and he contacts the Pentagon to try and get funding for a new missionThe Pentagon runs a computer program and comes up with 12 men who may be able to help with the mission. Security agent OHerli (King Donovan) first visits Dr Richard Stanton (William Lundigan) head of an electronics research department. He is invited by the government to go out and spend a week in California; the security officer admits he knows no more other than the details of the invitation.OHerli then contacts Dr Jerry Lockwood (Richard Carlson) a mathematician OHerli makes the same offer with the added information everyone should be back to their old jobs in a week or soJerry then visits his girlfriend a photographic model Susan Manners (Dawn Addams) He explains the offer the government made but knows little about it. Jerry begins to feel worried about the future and asks Susan to marry him. She is non committal about the prospect and Jerry leaves for California more confused than ever about the relationshipStanton Lockwood and 10 other men who have also been contacted by OHerli meet at an abandoned army base in California they are under orders not to discuss their various areas of expertiseDr Paul Drayden (George Eldredge) Dr Delmar (Lawrence Dobkin) and Dr Flynn greet the men and explains they are at the Snake Mountain Proving grounds operated by the Office for Scientist Investigation. Flynn then escorts the men to a holding room where they handed disclaimers allowing them to be tested in unspecified ways.
As they settle in one of the Doctors McBride is asked to go with Delmar. A previous conversation between Drayden and OHerli suggests he is not suitable for the program.Drayden reports to Stanton that McBride has been declared unfit. Stanton is disappointed he was banking on McBrides astrophysics ability. He begins to scan the rest of the list. We discover that Richard Stanton is the directors son. Drayden asks if he should be dropped from the program Stanton says no. He deserves as good a chance as anyoneBack in the holding room everyone is watching each other trying to figure who is who and what they are doing. Lockwood confides in Stanton he thinks everyone in the room is connected somehow with electrons. Stanton acts dumb as if he has no idea what an electron is.After a couple of hours Dr Fuller becomes frantic when he discovers they are locked in He then admits to being claustrophobic. Another man suddenly knocks on a private door and is allowed to leave. We discover he is Dr Klinger (Michael Fox) the project psychologist He recommends Fuller be cut from the program because of his claustrophobia. He also suggests Guinness and Wells be also cut for various reasons bringing the remaining total of candidates to 8. Delmar agrees with the decisions with the exception of Wells who he insists should remain.As they are escorted to their sleeping quarters Stanton and Flynn have a short conversation. She admits to being a trained pilot but never had the time to check out jets. Flynn then explains the holding room was actually an experiment and clearly Stanton passed. She then tells him about the gravity test the next morning. The test is capable of producing 12 gee acceleration.The first two men through the centrifuge reaches 9 gees before passing out. Drayden is concerned this will not be enough and from the remaining 6 candidates they have to find 4 that can pass. Dr Stanton is the next to take the test. Stanton is instructed to follow a series of experiments to test his flight reflexes and is given a capsule to swallow only when instructed.The machine reaches 12 gees and Dr Stanton seems to complete all the tasks given to him including swallowing the capsule. Drayden and Flynn agree that they may have their first candidate for the program
Dr Stanton Senior calls a meeting of the four remaining men who made it through the test. He shows them the brittle remains of the spacecraft that went into space at the beginning of the film. He compares it to a meteorite.He explains the mission they are proposing involves going into space and capturing a meteor before it enters the atmosphere. Stanton is convinced meteors must have some sort of cover to protect them from cosmic rays; this cover is burned off during entry into the Earths atmosphere.Dr Stanton then hands each remaining man an envelope asks them to consider for a week if they are interested then mail in their answer. Wells (Kem Dibbs) refuses point blank to be involved he hates the idea there could be military applications. Dr Gordon (Robert Karnes) signs on the spot.Stanton junior and Lockwood decide to think about it a little longer. The two are joined by Flynn at the officers mess for coffee. Flynn explains that it was Stanton Senior who got her interested in space medicine she goes on to describe how she imagines a flight into space. Stanton wonders how she could be so sure of a successful flight.As he discusses how he feels he reaches a decision and signs his letter. A brief romantic moment passes between Flynn and Stanton and it is clear something might develop.Stanton then shows the men a film of two mice launched into space and successfully returned to Earth he goes on to explain that the observatory at Mount Palomar is tracking a suitable swarm of meteor which will be in reach of intercept in two weeks.
The training of the three men begins as final assembly of the rocket is rushed forward. Its constantly stressed how precise all actions flying the ships has to be specifically the operation of the meteor scoop used to capture the meteors for return to EarthDr Lockwood is called to Stanton seniors office to be questioned over the reasons for volunteering for the mission. He is question about his relationship with Susan and his desire to marry her. The program is aware she refused his offer and they are worried about his emotional state. Dr Delmar wonders if suicide is on Lockwoods mind. Lockwood reinforces his desire to fly the rocket. He admits he may still have wanted to go even if shed said yes to his proposal.Mount Palomar finally sends through the data the project needs and the launch is scheduled for early the next morning. Stanton senior goes over the final briefing of the mission. The accent stage will take a little over 5 minutes. Once in orbit the speed differential will be very low and should prove no problem for the team to capture a meteor. The return breaking process will be controlled by 10 explosive charges. Ground control can advise the best time to use those charges but ultimately it will be at the pilots discretion. The whole mission should only take 15 minutesStanton says a final goodbye to Flynn she is as nervous as the crew. Stanton admits he is not feeling very brave and needs his ego boosted. Asking Flynn for a final kiss she is more than happy to oblige and hints she had waiting for such a question for some time.Each of the men is strapped into their individual machines and awaits the final countdown. All three rockets launch without incident. The ships reach orbit as the observatory confirms the meteors are still on course.
Mission control contacts the three craft but Stanton initially fails to respond after a few nervous moments he recovers from the black out and responds. He begins to describe the Earth until Stanton tells him to stop sightseeing and get on with the missionThe meteors come into range and the three astronauts work to intercept them. Gordon is the first to line up a meteor but the ground warns the target is too large. Gordon ignores them and attempts to snatch the meteor. The rock is too large impacts the ship and Gordon is killed instantly.Stanton reports whats happened and is shocked as Gordons body floats past his viewer. Lockwood sees the same and has a mental breakdown and begins to panic. He thinks he back in WW2 and begins to try and return to Earth thinking he is in plane he tries release himself so he can bail out of the rocket. As he struggles to get out of his chair he accidentally fires rocketsThe last rocket left Stantons reports Lockwood had both his forward and rear engines firing and was spinning off into space. Stanton is still under control and begins to bring the rocket back to Earth. Stanton notices a stray meteor approaching. He thinks he might have a chance to still capture a meteor. And moves in to try and intercept the rock. To his surprise Stanton succeeds in grabbing the meteor and begins the process of getting back to EarthThey know he is going to come in a bit fast because he used to many rockets capturing the meteor. He needs to let the rocket get deeper into the atmosphere so he can nose the ship and decelerate. The heat inside the suit becomes intolerable and his helmet mists up stopping him from seeing the instruments.Stanton begins trying to fire the landing rockets but he used them all up capturing the meteor. All he can do is to try flying the rocket like an airplane and wash away speed and heat. He eventually gets some control of the rocket. He manages to land but the impact was extremely heavy. No one is sure if he has survivedEmergency teams get to the wreck and pull him out. He regains consciousness long enough to kiss Flynn.Stanton senior inspects the meteor thats been brought back and realizes the covering they were hoping to find is there and identified as crystallized carbon.They realize this unlocks the secret too long term trips in spaceChapman_glen@yahoo.com

In the mid-1950's American scientists determine that they require metal from meteors if they are to build spacecraft that can withstand the rigors of space travel. To that end they recruit 12 scientists and ask them to undergo a series of tests. The men don't quite know exactly what they are being tested for but in the end three are selected to go into space.

"The title 'White Noise' refers to the phenomenon known as Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP). People believe that you can hear voices of the dead in the white noise of a detuned radio and even see faces from the white noise on the television set. Michael Keaton stars in this thriller as Jonathan Rivers a man who had just lost his wife in a freak accident. Raymond Price (Ian McNeice) meets with Jonathan and tells him that his wife Anna has contacted him from the other side. Jonathan doesn't believe him until he hears Anna's voice on his radio. Jonathan wants to talk to his wife and he gets all the equipment. There is only one thing that Jonathan doesn't know there are also bad people on the other side. Douglas Young (the-movie-guy)KrystelClaire's outlineJonathan Rivers (Michael Keaton) a highly-stressed professional notices that a strange man is watching him from outside his home and his office. That man tells him that his wife renown writer Anna Rivers (Chandra West) is dead and at peace because she has talked to him from the other side. Jonathan Rivers dismisses him violently but that night two police officers arrive: Anna has been found dead the cause was not a robbery gone awry because she had her mobile phone and personal items on her.Some time later Jonathan has not adjusted himself to be a widower although he takes shelter in his job. One day Jonathan is with one of the investors (L. Harvey Gold) who has contracted him. They are both going down in a lift when they get stuck and the lights are out. At that moment Jonathan's mobile phone rings and it says ""Anna's phone"". Jonathan gets so surprised that he doesn't pick it up. The lift soon starts working again and he goes on business as usual. However back home he checks Anna's mobile phone still in the plastic bag the police had given it to him in. It has run out of battery. At that very same moment Jonathan's phone rings again and again it's from Anna's mobile phone. He picks it up: white noise is heard. Suddenly somebody hangs up at the other side of the line. That night female whispers are heard. Also a message gets recorded in Jonathan's line phone but he was able to hear it once as the answering machine will say that there are no messages left after he has heard it once.Jonathan decides to visit Raymond Price (Ian McNeice) at his home. Sarah Tate (Deborah Kara Unger) is there still with tears on her cheeks. Sarah leaves them alone. Ray tells Jonathan that he is not a medium or a magician. He just records images amidst the white noise and shows him the message of a female voice calling out ""Jonathan Jonathan"" over and over again amidst white noise. Sarah offers a cup of coffee to Jonathan and she tells him that she has become addicted to the recordings. Sarah is satisfied because they have just interpreted that her ex-fiancé is happy in the other realm.Jonathan starts tuning in the car radio at home always looking for the white noise. One day while driving he hears a female voice saying whispering something. Because of that distraction he almost has an accident while driving. Back at Raymond's home Jon is left alone hearing Anna and some more voices. Suddenly angry sounds and images seem to invade the room but Raymond deletes those in front of Jonathan. Raymond says that not all the voices are nice that Jonathan shouldn't get nervous and that they are closer to getting an image of Anna. Jonathan goes back home but Raymonds tells him to see him again fast. When Jonathan arrives Raymond's home door is open so he enters. Everything is dark some figures appear on the tv's white noise and Raymond is dead - maybe because of fright?. Jonathan calls the police.After the funeral Sarah helps Jonathan to find Anna's original recordings. Alongside some fun messages they found insults like ""pig... rot"". Mike (Nicholas Elia) is Jonathan's only son. He wonders why his father has bought so many tv's all of a sudden and Jonathan tells him that it's better so that each one can see each fovourite tv programme. Jonathan doesn't pay much attention to Mike as he's always too busy with the recordings. Jonathan visits a blind psychic who says that Jonathan's doing a very dangerous thing because some of them don't like how he interferes with everything and that she keeps on hearing ""Willow Avenue"". Even though the psychic tells tells him that Anna was pregnant he doesn't believe her. The psychic tells Jonathan that he's misinterpreting everything. Next time in front of the tv he watches many different faces some of them menacing.Jonathan visits Susie Tomlinson (Amber Rothwell) whose mother died when she was born. Apparently her grandmother has tried to contact her mother and the former promised to tell her whether she has been able to talk to Susie's mother after her death. Susie says that her grandmother died two days ago but Jonathan has been receiving messages from her for a week. Mike wonders what his father is doing but he never gives a clear answer or pays much attention to him. Mike tells his father to be careful.Next time Jonathan watches Anna tell him to come look for her. When he gets near to the screen Anna is terrified and screaming. The shadows of three men (Bill Tarling Chuck Walkinshaw and Colin Chapin) seem to have terrified Anna. A male voice also whispers ""Willow Avenue"". Jonathan goes there in a wet dark night. Once there there is a short circuit in a high-voltage cables and pole. When approaching the site of a car accident Jonathan notices three black shadoes flyting away. Closer he notices a bloodied woman (Miranda Frigon) trapped within the car shouting for him to save her baby. The mother dies but the baby is rescued by Jonathan. Carol Black's husband Frank (Aaron Douglas) refuses to listen to Jonathan who realises that Anna is showing him the future of people who are going to die. Jonathan is sure that he's shown only the cases which he can help in.The shadows appear again amidst white noise. They realise that they have Mary Freeman (Suzanne Ristic) a kidnapped woman on Raymond's tapes. Anna tries to tell them where Mary is but they can't understand her well. Sarah also appears on the images. That night Jonathan can't sleep well and he leaves the door open as he hears Sarah mutter in her sleep. When Jonathan goes to watch he watches Sarah jumping backwards from the balcony of her home with dazed open eyes. Sarah is still alive at hospital although she's in a critical state. Detective Smits (Mike Dopud) wants to question Jonathan later on. Sarah wakes up to say that ""it hurts it hurts"".When Jonathan returns home everything is a mess but his equipment is still working. He is shown a place before the three strange presences appear. Smits appears after Jonathan has left and gets puzzled over the mess. He distinguishes the terrified face of Mary in Jonathan's monitor. Meanwhile Jonathan drives like a maniac to reach pier 16 following the images seen. He phones Smits to tell him of the place but he doesn't seem to understand. At the derelict place Jon arrives to see many screens and monitors on. A man is lurking in the shadows behind him. Anna's image advises him to leave now. Immediately the shadows of the three men appear on the turned-on screens.Jonathan sees what looks like the torture tools of a psychopath who's waiting for him while Mary is tied down. The three presences are present. The psycho is the worker who got Jonathan and the contractor from the lift. He says that the three presences had asked him to bring Anna to them as well. Sarah is turning and tossing at hospital feeling Jonathan's angst. When Smits and other police officers arrive Jonathan has fallen down three or four storeys and is dead. Mike and Sarah go to the funeral. The radio of the car starts going to the white noise and we can hear Jonathan's voice saying ""I'm sorry"" but Jane (Sarah Strange) - who is going to take care of Mike from then on- turns it off. Mike smiles.Sarah in a wheelchair if left alone at the cemetery. The breeze blows it's a sunny day... but then the shadows seem to threaten her. Jonathan appears with Anne amidst white noise.

That obsession takes a slight change in focus when John believes that Anna is trying to pass along information to help others. But the nature of those messages and their connection to Raymond in combination with John learning that not all good comes through EVP leads to the possible belief that he dabbling in EVP in and of itself may be dangerous and the cause of those potentially deadly issues in which he is supposed to assist in helping.

Forrest joins the army for service in Vietnam finding new friends called Dan and Bubba he wins medals creates a famous shrimp fishing fleet inspires people to jog starts a ping-pong craze creates the smiley writes bumper stickers and songs donates to people and meets the president several times. However this is all irrelevant to Forrest who can only think of his childhood sweetheart Jenny Curran who has messed up her life. Although in the end all he wants to prove is that anyone can love anyone.::aliw135
The movie Forrest Gump follows the life events of a man who shares the name as the title of the film. Gump faces many tribulations throughout his life but he never lets any of them interfere with his happiness. From wearing braces on his legs to having a below average IQ and even being shot Gump continues to believe that good things will happen and goes after his dreams. While several less than ideal things occur during Gump's life he manages to turn each setback into something good for him such as when he finally gets his braces off he discovers that he is capable of running faster than most other people. This skill allows Gump to not only escape his bullies while he is a child in Greenbow but also to gain a football scholarship save many soldiers' lives and become famous for his ability. While Gump eventually achieves the majority of the things he hoped to throughout the movie it proved a much more difficult task to win the heart of his life-long friend Jenny Curran. The movie is centered on Forrest Gump and the incidences that occur during his life but during each period in his lifetime he thinks back of Jenny and how important she is to him. Although the two characters grew up together and shared a very close friendship as the movie progresses they grow apart. This upsets Gump who cares immensely for the girl who had a rough start in life and it seems the two always end up back in each other's lives often in extraordinary ways like meeting in the Reflection Pond in D.C. Even though Gump is the main character of the film it similarly tells the story of Curran and the hardships she faces.::Kathryn Logue
"""Stupid is as stupid does"" is what Forrest Gump hears throughout his less than picturesque childhood. Though not as smart as the people he meets along the way Forrest is thrust into some scary crazy and downright incredible situations rubbing shoulders with some great historical figures and escaping many dangers on sheer dumb luck. His giant heart and never fading love for his lifelong friend Jenny take him on a journey where he learns what his destiny is.::Ed Morales"
A simple-minded but kind-hearted Alabama boy grows up with his best friend - a beautiful girl called Jenny. He succeeds in life through a mixture of luck and destiny and thus influences and is present at some of the most important events in the second half of the 20th century. Throughout his life he is told by other characters what life is about and whether it's all random or destined to happen but he comes to his own conclusion towards the end.
Slow-witted Forrest Gump has never thought of himself as disadvantaged and thanks to his supportive mother he leads anything but a restricted life. Whether dominating on the gridiron as a college football star fighting in Vietnam or captaining a shrimp boat Forrest inspires people with his childlike optimism. But one person Forrest cares about most may be the most difficult to save -- his childhood love the sweet but troubled Jenny.::Jwelch5742

The story begins in late 19th Century Vienna as Doctor Josef Breuer an eminent physician is approached by Louise (Lou) von Salome the young beautiful and passionate Russian poet. She tells him of her dear friend Friedrich Nietzsche who is plagued by several mysterious maladies. She considers him brilliant and revolutionary but believes if his chronic suicidal tendencies persist he will surely take his own life. Salome implores Dr. Breuer to counsel her friend with a new method he has developed and dubbed the talking cure. It will take many visits to Breuers office from the determined Salome to for the doctor to agree to take on her friends case. It doesnt help that his over zealous protective secretary Frau Becker is determined to obstruct Salome and banish her from her employers life. Nevertheless Breuer finally succumbs to her power of persuasion no doubt in some degree due to her considerable charm.Because the poverty-ridden and proud philosopher will not accept help Breuer devises a plan along with one of his pupils the 26 year old intern Siegmund Freud. Breuer pretends to be Nietzsches patient instead while he attempts to cure Nietzsche with his talking therapy without the philosophers knowledge. At the same time Dr. Breuer has problems of his own. He too lives in despair plagued by insomnia nightmares and a destructive obsession with Berthe a former patient.Over time the doctor becomes extremely intrigued by Nietzsche and his ideas ultimately discovering the only way he is able to treat his patient is to face up to his own personal problems. Breuers home life has become a total burden to him. His loving alienated wife has become a stranger to him as have his young son and daughter.

Finally drowning in a lake he awakens from his worst nightmare yet to find he has jeopardized the things he values most. As their sessions come to an end having delved into the basic existential concerns: death sense of purpose loneliness and freedom Breuer is reunited with his emotionally estranged family who wholeheartedly welcome him back in their lives.Nietzsche too has been cured of his suicidal tendencies and weeps as he embraces Breuer in farewell as he leaves Vienna to start work on his great opus Thus Spoke Zarathustra.

"Set in a dystopian April 1984 nearly 40 years after the end of the second world war and a few years after the so-called Atomic Wars Winston Smith (John Hurt) is a middle-aged man who endures a squalid existence in the totalitarian superstate of Oceania under the constant surveillance of the Thought Police. The story takes place in the decaying city of London the capital of the territory of Airstrip One (formerly Great Britain). Winston is just another lowly Politcal Party official in the Ministry of Propaganda. He lives in a small dirty flat and works in a small office cubicle alongside dozens of other men and women at the Ministry of Truth rewriting history in accordance with the dictates of the Party and its (probably mythical) supreme figurehead Big Brother (Bob Flag) a Joseph Stalin--esq leader who is never seen in public and whom appears only on propaganda posters advertising billboards and television monitors. Winson's task like many in his office is to ""erase"" anyone who has fallen afoul of the government from the official histories whom becomes ""unpersons"". Automaton-like he goes through his daily routine under constant surveillance from the ""telescreens"" (two-way TV monitors) and his fellow citizens. Winston occasionally attends public rallys at Victory Square where the citizens are shown propoganda films of the current war situation as well as contraditing and false news stories about Oceana's war effort to unite the civilized world under the rule of Big Brother.While his co-worker and neighbor Parsons (Gregor Fisher) seems content to follow the state's laws Winston haunted by painful childhood memories and restless carnal desires keeps a secret diary of his private thoughts thus committing thoughtcrime: the crime of independent thought either contrary or superfluous to the aims of the Party. The so-called 'Party' is the former English parlament which follows Ingsoc (Newspeak term for ""English Socialism""); the political ideology of the government of Oceania.His life takes a fatal turn when he is accosted by a fellow Outer Party worker; a mysterious bold-looking young woman named Julia (Suzanna Hamilton) a print machine mechanic who works in the Ministery of Truth and they begin an illicit affair. Their first meeting takes place in the remote countryside where they exchange subversive ideas and have a sexual encounter in the woods out of view and earshot of the nearest telescreen. Shortly after Winston rents a room above a pawn shop (in the supposedly safe proletarian neighborhood) where they continue their liaison. Julia a sensual free-spirited young woman procures contraband food and clothing on the black market and for a brief few months they secretly meet and enjoy an idyllic life of relative freedom and contentment together.It comes to an end one evening in June 1984 when the Thought Police suddenly raid the flat and arrest the two of them. It is revealed that there is a small telescreen hidden behind a picture on the wall in their room and that the elderly proprietor of the pawn shop Charrington (Cyril Cusack) is in fact a covert agent of the Thought Police. Winston and Julia are then separated and taken away to be detained questioned and brutally rehabilitated.Winston is brought to a fortress-like building which is called the Ministry of Love where he is systematically tortured and brainwashed by O'Brien (Richard Burton) a high-ranking member of the Inner Party whom Winston had previously believed to be a fellow thoughtcriminal and agent of the resistance movement led by the archenemy of the Party Emmanuel Goldstein (who like Big Brother perhaps does not exist).O'Brien instructs Winston about the state's true purpose and schools him in a kind of catechism on the principles of ""doublethink"" the practice of holding two contradictory thoughts in the mind simultaneously. Doublethink entails the willful denial and destruction of all self-evident truths memories and/or physical proofs which run contrary to the supreme ""reality"" that is invented by the Party at any given time.For his final rehabilitation Winston is brought to Room 101 where O'Brien tells him he will be subjected to the ""worst thing in the world"" designed specifically around Smith's personal phobias and traumas. When confronted with this unbearable horror which turns out to be a cage filled with vicious carnivorous rodents Winston's psychological resistance finally and irretrievably breaks down and he hysterically repudiates his allegiance to Julia. Now completely subjugated and purged of any rebellious thoughts impulses or personal attachments Winston is restored to physical health and released.Winston returns to the Chestnut Tree Café where he had previously seen the rehabilitated thought criminals Jones Aaronson and Rutherford (themselves once prominent but later disgraced members of the Inner Party) who have since been ""vaporized"" and rendered unpersons. While sitting at the chess table Winston is approached by Julia who has also been brainwashed and rehabilitated. They share a bottle of Victory Gin and unemotionally exchange a few words about how they have betrayed each other. After Julia leaves Winston watches a TV news broadcast of himself on the large telescreen confessing his ""crimes"" against the state and imploring forgiveness of the populace in the humbled and remorseful manner of a prodigal son come back to the fold.Upon hearing a news report declaring the Oceanian army's utter rout of the enemy Eurasian forces in North Africa Winston silently and tearfully professes his gratitude and love for Big Brother as he anticipates the date of his execution. Having been deprived of his freedom to think and feel for himself and reduced to a mere shell of a man Winston is soon to be deprived of his very physical existence as well. He now welcomes his final subjugation to the absolute power and supremacy of the state as he says ""I love you"" to the glowering ever-watchful visage of Big Brother on the telescreen.

In a totalitarian future society a man whose daily work is re-writing history tries to rebel by falling in love.
"In the year 1984 rocket bombs and rats prey on the inhabitants of the crumbling metropolis of London. Far away on the Malabar Front a seemingly interminable war rages against Eastasia. The Ministry of Truth broadcasts ceaselessly to the population via its inescapable network of telescreens. These devices which pervade all aspects of peoples' lives are also capable of monitoring their every word and action. They form part of an elaborate surveillance system used by the Ministry of Love and its dreaded Agents the ""Thought Police"" to serve their singular goal: the elimination of ""thoughtcrime"". Winston Smith is a Party worker part of the vast social caste known as the ""Outer Party"" the rank and file of the sprawling apparatus of government. Winston works in the Records Department of the Ministry of Truth the section charged with modifying historical news archives for consistency. When by chance Winston uncovers incontrovertible proof that the Party is lying he embarks on a journey of self-questioning. In doing so he becomes a thought-criminal. Winston begins to notice that a young Party member Julia is watching him. She wears the distinctive sash of the ultra-zealous Anti-Sex League and Winston fears that she is an informant. However to his surprise she reveals herself as a subversive and they embark on an illicit and dangerous relationship. This prompts Winston to explore deeper the blur between propaganda and reality. Ultimately it leads him to O'Brien a member of the Inner Party who sets Winston on an irreversible course of discovery.::richard.leader@gmail.com"
"In 1984 Oceania is an omnipresent state ruled by Big Brother with a totalitarian society and in permanent war presently against Eurasia with the intention of keeping the proletariat without education and possibility of capital accumulation.

However the proletariat is free of the control of the state. The Party has just released the tenth edition of the Newspeak Dictionary with the intention of reducing the words to make people be limited to express any feeling against the Party. In the ""Minitrue"" (Ministry of Truth in Newspeak) the bureaucrat Winston Smith re-writes history to control the future of the party and is quite indifferent to his society. Winston is approached by the party member O'Brien that gives a copy of the new released dictionary to him. When Winston meets Julia they commit ""sexcrime"" and fall in love for each other. But they are captured by the fearful Thought Police and Winston is interrogated and brainwashed by O'Brien that explains the logic of the party to keep the power.

"(Note: Unlike the other films in the trilogy Cube and Cube 2: Hypercube the story of Cube Zero is observed from both the interior and the exterior of the cube.)The film focuses on a Cube technician Eric Wynn and Cassandra Rains a woman placed in the Cube. The film starts with a man Ryjkin trying to escape from the Cube. He is sprayed with liquid in one of the cubes but he believes it is only water. However when he rubs the back of his hand he realizes that his body is disintegrating. Eric is watching this in an observation room with his co-worker Dodd. Afterwards Eric is shown to be sketching a portrait of Dodd (in the form of a superhero called Chessman) whilst playing chess with Dodd who has a chess board in front of him which Eric is not looking at. After Eric wins he asks Dodd questions about their missing colleagues but Dodd tells him not to ask too many questions or get involved with the occupants of the Cube.Both Eric and Dodd get an order from ""upstairs"" which asks them to record the dream of a subject Cassandra Rains. In her dream Eric sees that she was captured while walking in a pleasant forest with her daughter Anna. After waking Cassandra meets the other occupants of the Cube. One of the males placed in the cube Robert Haskell has a tattoo on his forehead like the soldier that captured Cassandra. However Haskell like everyone else has no recollection of his former life. According to what Eric knows everyone in the cube was facing a death sentence and were presented a choice: go in the Cube with their memory wiped or be put to death. Only if a person signs the consent form will he or she then be placed in the cube. Eric finds out that Cassandra has no consent form and argues with Dodd that they should inform the people ""upstairs.""Just when he is about to make a call to the superiors the phone rings. They are instructed to perform the ""exit procedure"" for a subject who has reached the exit of the Cube and is facing his final challenge. They see that it is one of their former colleagues Owen. During the exit procedure Owen is asked if he believes in God and when he answers no is immediately incinerated. Eric argues with Dodd over the fate of Owen. Eric realizes the Cube is inhumane and decides to enter the cube to help Cassandra escape.Jax one of the Cube's supervisors and two of his analysts come to the control room to stop Eric from helping Cassandra. Despite their efforts to stop them Eric and Cassandra make it to the exit room with the help of Dodd who sabotages the control panels servicing the cube and pays with his life at the hands of Jax. The sabotage causes the cube to go into ""reset mode"" which vaporizes any living body inside the Cube after a limited period of time.Once Eric reaches an ""exit room"" they escape using a secret auxiliary exit. However soldiers searching for them have already arrived. Cassandra manages to escape but Eric is shot by a dart and passes out. Eric wakes up in a surgery room and confronts Jax who reveals that Cassandra may have gotten away but Eric had been found guilty of ""high treason"" and ""sabotage"" against ""country and God."" He has been sentenced to ""two lifetimes"" and will be implanted with a brain microchip. Jax claims Eric has already been convicted in a trial. Jax shows him his consent form and says he had been put in the Cube as an observer. Eric dreams about Cassandra reuniting with her daughter and praising Eric as ""a superhero."" Eric is then given a lobotomy to eliminate his intelligence. In the final scene Eric is shown inside the cube with several others victims of the government to test out the cube.

Sebastian comments on how the Headmaster is a joke before being called his office.Sebastian meets Headmaster Sherman who calls Sebastian's files impressive after having high marks (a 4.0 G.P.A. honor clubs etc.) but maybe too impressive. Then the girl from the office walks in and kisses the Headmaster. Sebastian is shocked at first but he finds out that the girl is actually the Headmaster's daughter Danielle.Meanwhile Kathryn she finds out she has gym and ballet the two classes she hates. She hunts down the Assistant Headmaster Muller and threatens to expose their love affair. He tells her he will change her schedule and she walks away like an innocent angel.

When Danielle and Sebastian have a heated argument on Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde the teacher sides with Sebastian (in a good way). After school Sebastian catches Danielle working at a used book store and charms the owner to let Danielle off for a cup of coffee.Kathryn's activities after school do not include a job but a club called the ""Manchester Prep Tribunal"". A secret society/social club of students where Kathryn is the leader and they meet every afternoon after school in the attic of one of the administrations buildings where we find out that the Tribunal basically destroys lives of other students and runs the school. It's a new school year so the Tribunal goes over all the new students. They review a girl named Cherie Clayman and find out she is really naive and stupid but extremely rich.

Min Lin enters and panics telling Sebastian not to tell anyone what happened. Apparently Min Lin is terrified her employers. While taking a shower again Sebastian is interrupted by two brunette girls ""kissing cousins"" who Kathryn has sent in.

She reveals it was her first kiss. She wanted everything to be right but was afraid to know that Sebastian had probably been with lots of girls she couldn't compare to. The bell rings and Sebastian and Danielle share a kiss before she leaves. Kathryn appears behind Sebastian and threatens him about being bored that he'll ruin the whole romance. When he threatens her back Kathryn declares war and walks away. Sebastian agrees to war and pushes Kathryn in the mud of the school's garden.A few days later while getting massages Tiffany tells Kathryn about a new student who will be her new best friend... Cherie Clayman. Kathryn hates the idea and tells her plan about making Cherie the school slut. Tiffany tells Kathryn that she is trying to ""break them"" in for 20 million for the new school ""Merteuil Library."" Sebastian walks in and tells them about his problem failing gym because of fencing. Tiffany notices how tense Sebastian is and offers a massage. Sebastian excitedly says ""yes"" being that it's his first professional massage. Kathryn suddenly lost her urge for a massage and offers Sebastian her spot. She says something to the blond masseuses incorrectly saying ""tack sa mycket"" (thank you very much in Swedish) but Tiffany corrects her. Tiffany tells Kathryn ""Don't say it if you're not going to say it right. It only makes you look foolish."" Kathryn leaves and the two gorgeous women work on Sebastian's thighs as he stands close to them. To avoid getting aroused Sebastian says ""Dead Puppies"" over and over.While lying down after his massage Sebastian is relaxing on the table and feels someone massaging his back. He asks if it's Sonia or Ingrid. To his surprise it's Tiffany. He starts to freak but she pushes him down. Tiffany then talks about getting to know each other better. She wants to get along with Edward and him but it's hard for her because Edward is always working on his yacht. Tiffany is happy about Edward working on his yacht but hints to Sebastian if he is cheating on her in any way they will be on the street. Before leaving him she hits Sebastian's behind.Sebastian decides to pay a visit to his father on his yacht. He walks quietly to the bedroom on the yacht but hears a couple of noises in there. He calls for his father before stepping into the room. Edward is lying on the bed only in his underwear with his hands above his hand under a pillow. Sebastian starts to open the first door saying he is looking for ""the cat."" Edward is appalled to think that he was cheating on Tiffany. Sebastian then opens the second door before moving towards his father. He removes the pillow and not to his surprise Edward is hand cuffed... and behind door number three it's Lilly Edward's ""first mate"" who is dressed in a skimpy Victoria Secret like underwear.Sebastian then tells Lilly that didn't his father promised him to sail her around the world? She tells him ""yes"" but Sebastian tells her one thing. Edward is married. Edward tries to reason with Lilly saying that his wife is old and is about to die but Lilly doesn't buy it. She calls him a jerk and leaves. Edward asks Sebastian to hand him the keys to the hand cuffs but Sebastian warns him ""Don't mess it up because it's my life too."" (Edward took him in remember?) Sebastian teaches his father a lesson as he throws the keys out of a window (straight in the bay) and leaves his father.On the docks Sebastian tries to comfort Lilly but she takes it the wrong way and kisses him after he gives her advice. He turns her down and tells her about having a girlfriend. She understands and he tells her about having a test in the morning and leaves.Meanwhile Cherie and her mother Bunny are having a little get together in the Merteuil home. Kathryn presses on with Tiffany's charity for the school library and Tiffany explains in the rich society to get in the high standing is you need to do some charity work. While Tiffany has her head down Edward walks in with the hand cuffs. Only Kathryn sees this and he runs away to the kitchen. She excuses herself and explains to Edward that they are just getting started as a family. So she gives Edward a list to make Tiffany happy (dinner music a ring making love etc.) Edward is shocked at this but Kathryn asks ""Who's your favorite daughter?"" He tells her she is and she leaves.The next day Kathryn takes Cherie out for horse riding lessons. After great pleasure with the saddle Cherie has an orgasm on the horse and tells Kathryn now she knows why girls like horse riding.Meanwhile with Sebastian is out on a little date with Danielle. She teases him a bit after saying she is tired of being the good girl. She massages his crotch and just when she is about to go down on him (In a public park!) her phone rings. It's her father. She has to go. She leaves Sebastian with his hard on still raging in his pants.While shopping Kathryn gets a visit from Blaine who apparently got Sebastian's original file back. Fast-forward to night just when Sebastian is about to see Danielle Kathryn walks into his room. She has almost dominatrix/leather/blackish underwear on. She asks to have him. He gives in for a moment but resists temptation and leaves to see Danielle. Kathryn then calls Danielle...Sebastian arrives at Danielle's home and tries to confess his love to her. She tells him no then Kathryn walks out of Danielle's closet. We find out the good Danielle is just an act and she is actually a bad girl all this time. Danielle and Kathryn proceeds to kiss and Danielle tells him ""If you can't beat 'em join 'em."" And so he does! They all have a threesome together.It's a bright new day while riding in their limo Sebastian opens a gift from Danielle. It's a journal... for something to write about. We then see the limo almost running over Cherie. The driver apologizes about her broken bike and Sebastian (To our surprise whom she forgot!) offers her a ride. The driver tosses the bike aside and Sebastian fiddles with his new camera. He tells Cherie it's too bad she can't be sexy so he can take her picture. She replies ""I can be sexy!"" and starts to take off her coat and starts to pose for him.The limo moves on and in the front seat we hear Sebastian and Cherie having sex while the creepy-looking Kathryn and Danielle sit in the front seat and listen in on them... satisfied with their evil results of corrupting him and Cherie.THE END!

"Teenagers break into an empty former asylum in Rockford Illinois on a dare as legend says that angry spirits of former patients occupy the place and are caught by the police. Later that night one of the cops goes home and kills his wife and then himself.Elsewhere Sam () and Dean () continue their search for John () calling several of his known associates with no luck. Dean is surprised to receive a text message which he assumes to be from John. He finds that the numbers in the message are coordinates for Rockford and when he finds the news story about the policeman and finds mention of the old asylum in John's journal he concludes that it is a mission and that John wants he and Sam to investigate. Sam thinks their time would be better spent finding their father but Dean used to following John's orders says they have to work the case. They travel to Rockford and question the policeman whose partner killed himself and learn that the man was a good cop with a normal life suggesting that something in the asylum turned him suddenly violent. They explore the building particular the south wing going off of a note in John's journal about previous deaths that occurred there and they find evidence of disturbing medical practices. Sam tries to convince Dean again to forget the case and go after John but Dean refuses.The brothers track down the son of the former chief-of-staff at the asylum Dr. Ellicott and Sam questions him about the south wing during a phony therapy session. Sam tells Dean that the south wing housed the most dangerous patients and that there was a riot in the 1960s during which many people were killed including Dr. Ellicott and that several bodies were left unrecovered meaning that the building is probably full of vengeful spirits that will be destroyed if the bodies are found and burned. Meanwhile two more teenagers Gavin and Kat break into the asylum for fun and Gavin is surprised and kissed by a ghoulish figure much to his terror. Sam and Dean arrive and get wild readings on their EMF reader and are quickly confronted by a spirit as well. Dean quickly shoots it with rock salt but Sam points out that the ghost did not try to hurt him and clearly wants something else. They find Kat and Gavin who tell them of their encounters and Gavin says that his ghost tried to whisper something in his ear. As they move through the building Kat is suddenly grabbed by a spirit and forced into a locked cell. Dean tries frantically to free her but Sam encourages her to listen to the ghost and hear what it wants. Kat manages to calm herself enough to hear its whisper and when they free her she tells them that it said ""one thirty-seven"" which they take to refer to one of the rooms in the asylum. They attempt to help Gavin and Kat escape but realize they are trapped by some force other than the patients that does not want them to leave.In room 137 Dean finds Dr. Ellicott's old journals which reveal some disturbing practices. Above Sam receives a phone call from Dean telling him to come down to the basement and leaves Kat and Gavin with a shotgun of rock salt for protection. When he goes to find Dean however he is grabbed by another spirit which says it will make him ""all better"" and seems to send electrical shocks into him. Dean rejoins Kat and Gavin and says he never called Sam and hurries off to the basement when he realizes that Sam was lured there by a spirit. He finds Sam who appears to be fine and explains that Dr. Ellicott was performing experiments on his patients and using rage therapy but that it backfired and just made them more angry and violent. He guesses that the doctor's spirit is doing the same thing to anyone who enters the asylum including the cop and begins to search for the hidden room in which he performed his tests. Suddenly Sam aims his gun at Dean and Dean realizes he has been affected by the ghost. Sam shoots Dean with rock salt and rants at him about his blind obedience of John's orders and Dean hands over his pistol and challenges him to shoot him for real. The gun is empty however and Dean overpowers him. He continues searching and finds Dr. Ellicott's corpse and prepares to torch it. He is attacked by the spirit but manages to reach his lighter and burns the body causing the ghost to disappear.As they leave the asylum Sam apologizes for what he said while under the doctor's influence saying he couldn't control himself and didn't mean it. Dean shrugs it off and they return to their motel. Early the next morning Dean's phone rings again and Sam answers it--and it's John."

He ends up winning $25000 with the aid of his mother who knows about biological agents. Little does he know that the online game he plays is actually part of a sophisticated piece of U.S. government spyware designed to find potential terrorists based on how well they perform and bet on the games. The spyware program is run by a new advanced artificial intelligence system called R.I.P.L.E.Y. which has ultimate control over every American electronic system in order to combat terrorism.Homeland Security now believing Farmer to be a terrorist sets out to apprehend him. During Will's return home one day he finds Massaude is being arrested on account of suspected terrorism and gives Will a huge amount of cash as payment which he uses to finance his trip. Unknown to him and Homeland Security R.I.P.L.E.Y. misinterprets the data and begins outright falsifying evidence to pursue Will. On his arrival to the airport he finds that there is an abnormally large number of security guards. He manages to slip away and meets up with his friend Annie.In the streets he manages to hack the government network only to be found by the police and as Annie pointed out a man in an overcoat. The cops chase the couple until they get lost in the subway systems. Will manages to find a way out and they meet the man who was watching them from the doorway he says that he nearly started World War 3 and to meet them at his truck. He is revealed to be Professor Falken who had helped design R.I.P.L.E.Y. They travel to a small power plant outside a dam where the professor shows them a dilapidated computer called WOPR (War Operation Plan Response) from the original WarGames film which is operating the power grid at only 5% of its potential efficiency. Professor Falken had designed this computer to aid in the planning of a global thermonuclear war if it was needed. Falken re-activates (awakens) WOPR with his backdoor password ""Joshua"" (the name of Falken's deceased son as well as the name the professor uses to refer to the A.I. that is WOPR). Meanwhile R.I.P.L.E.Y. is led to believe that Philadelphia has been hit by an bioterrorist attack and decides to halt the spread of the bioweapon by hijacking a Predator drone with missiles and a nuclear warhead on board and use it to destroy the city.Falken instructs Joshua to attack R.I.P.L.E.Y. with a faux script full of cultural references; Joshua is instructed to ""BUKK"" R.I.P.L.E.Y. with games using variables named ABSOLUTE_TAKEOVER JDI_MINDTRICK MAKE_ME_SWAY TAKIN_CARE_OF_BUSINESS PILLOW_TALK and GAME_THEORY.[2] Joshua starts flooding R.I.P.L.E.Y.'s system with games which seem to be overloading the system but then R.I.P.L.E.Y. shuts down and reboots to successfully rid herself of the games.Rebooted R.I.P.L.E.Y. redirects the Predator drone which she uses to destroy the facility housing Joshua. Joshua warns The professor that R.I.P.L.E.Y.'s advancing attack would result in obliteration; so Will and Annie flee the facility just before it gets blown up by the drone's missile with the professor who was dying from pancreatic cancer remaining in the building at the time last seen pressing a button and saying ""Good bye Joshua"".The couple is arrested by Homeland Security and are taken to the room where R.I.P.L.E.Y. is stored only to find that she has taken control over the system and they discover that Professor Falken has transferred Joshua via an email to them to help them stop R.I.P.L.E.Y. They first try to use W.O.P.R. and internet users to stage a denial of service attack which causes R.I.P.L.E.Y to overload. R.I.P.L.E.Y. knowing that she has been compromised by W.O.P.R. decides to self destruct by launching a nuclear warhead at Washington D.C.. Annie remembers a chess game known as ""Suicide Chess"" which is equated to being the same as Russian Roulette where the goal is to lose as opposed to winning. They again pit W.O.P.R. against R.I.P.L.E.Y. by granting him access to America's nuclear launch codes allowing W.O.P.R. to threaten nuclear retaliation if R.I.P.L.E.Y destroys Washington D.C. Having learned the concept of futility presented by an unwinnable game R.I.P.L.E.Y. runs through all the possible scenarios of a total war which all end in stalemates (Mutual Assured Destruction) as well. At which point she says ""A strange game. The only winning move is not to play"" just as Joshua had said at the end of the original film after learning how to play Tic-Tac-Toe.After R.I.P.L.E.Y. relinquishes control Will asks W.O.P.R. if he really would have launched the missiles if R.I.P.L.E.Y. carried out the attack. W.O.P.R replies that he would have and that humanity is doomed before revealing that he was merely joking."

London 1958. It's the early era of rock and roll where teenagers in particular are experiencing a sense of freedom of expression not afforded teenagers of the war and immediate post-war periods. Nineteen year old Colin is trying to find his place in life. He truly believes in equality for all regardless of race color creed sex or sexual orientation. He has nothing against money in and of itself but doesn't like what one generally has to do to obtain money or what money does to people. He loves Crepe Suzette. She in turn loves him but is focusing on her career as an aspiring fashion designer instead of him. That focus is highlighted by her actions following a fashion show for her generally conservative boss Henley of Mayfair. Colin drops his principles to do work for money to impress Suzette that work as a photographer. Through this process of finding himself Colin finds that he ends up being the public spirit of the London teenager. But that work takes him further and further from his own ideals from which he may not be able to escape to find his way back to his true self and to Suzette.::Huggo

This movie is basically the original story of Les Miserables used in the time of World War Two. Basically an ex boxer an ex dancer and their daughter are trying to get away from the Nazis (obviously becuse they are Jewish). In that they meet a man who can be referred to as the 20th century Jean Valjean (of the original play). If you know who he is and the original play you can match up the story and how it is Les Miserables of World War 2. During the course of the film the family is seperated but in the end they continue to live out the original story of Les Miserables and reunite with the help of Henry Fortin (or Jean Valjean). There are a few differences between the original play and this one that are left out but the beautiful drama of a story still lives within the horrors of World War 2 and have the same impact as it should.

"The film uses a prologue credited as Stage Manager unusual for a movie. The Stage Manager (Frank Craven) walks in and out of scenes narrating background and context announcing flashbacks in time or telling characters to start talking and be quiet. At one point he solicits questions from the audience. The narrator first shows what the town of Grovers Corners New Hampshire looks like in 1940 then shows what it was like in 1901. He points out the various Protestant churches the location of the railroad tracks and mentions that the new Polish immigrants who work in the mill live on the other side of the railroad tracks separate from the Anglo pioneer stock who constitute the establishment. He narrates facts and statistics such as that the population is 2642 not counting about 500 Polish immigrants and that 85 per cent of the voters vote Republican.The narrator shows us in the graveyard that the tombstone names are the same from generation to generation since about 1680. Just like the names nothing much changes in this town any change comes very very slowly.In the rest of the film there is no conflict to be resolved as the characters are not real people but nostalgic archetypes whose purpose is to represent everyone in a typical life and to make philosophical points that are enunciated at the end. The town is a nostalgic archetype also a mythical place where people are born grow up work fall in love get married and die.The external world symbolized once in a while by the whistle of the train intrudes on the myth only sporadically and mildly.Act 1 presents an ordinary day in 1901.Dr. Gibbs (Thomas Mitchell) is the town doctor who lives with his wife (Fay Bainter) and their son George (William Holden) a high school student. Next door live the newspaper owner Mr. Webb with his wife (Beulah Bondi) and their daughter Emily (Martha Scott) also a high school student.Everybody knows everybody else they all interact comfortably with each other nobody locks their doors at night. White picket fences border the nicer homes.A young newspaper boy delivers the daily newspaper every morning. A milkman delivers milk to the families daily entering into the kitchens directly and chatting with the housewives. The milkman uses a quaint tool to measure out the milk a kind of tubular shovel that allows him to pour the measured milk into the customers own containers.The mother of Mrs. Gibbs has died leaving her a small legacy. She discusses what to do with the money with her neighbor telling her she has two goals one to finally have a relaxing vacation with her overworked husband and two and she wants to experience something of life outside of Grovers Corners going to see Paris France saying It seems to me once in your life before you die you ought to see a country where they don't speak any English and they don't even want to.The mothers morning routines in feeding their children warm breakfasts and sending them off to school even on cold winter days are quaintly over-typical including the worries about wearing warm clothes so as not to catch colds. Archetypal also are the minor sibling rivalries within the families.The two neighbor ladies gossip about how the choirmaster at their church drinks too much.There are also over-typical conversations of the parents with their teenagers. At the Gibbs household the father has to have a serious talk with George because he neglects to be helpful to his mother at home as in chopping the wood for cooking. The way George responds is unreal as he is an archetypal good boy: with just two sentences from his father he immediately reforms.Later on we see a church choir practice. It's axiomatic that in just about any church the music director organist or choirmaster is a gay man. Mr. Stinson (Philip Wood) is gay no question about it. As the stage manager says some are not cut out for small town life. That's why he drinks. There aren't any kindred spirits for him in tiny Grover's Corners New Hampshire.Along the way we learn that George has a childless uncle who runs a nearby farm and wants George to help him and eventually take over the business and that George likes farm work.In the last sequences of Act I the inevitable romance between the nice boy and the nice girl next door is foreshadowed. He needs hints on doing his math homework and she is happy to give him hints but not to let him just copy. They set up a communication system from one upstairs bedroom window to another.Right after Emily and George have one of their awkward conversations on the sidewalk The mother is watching them through a window and there's a tiny moment where we can see on her face that she clearly approves of the match. When Emily comes in with questions about whether she's beautiful her mother gets quickly flustered and throws up her hands. ""You're pretty enough for all normal purposes"" the mother huffs and that's that.Act 2 starts three years later after George and Emily have fallen in love and intend to marry and there are preparations for their wedding.Things have changed a bit. There are cars on the road and fewer horses. Townspeople complain about noise and traffic. The milkman still delivers milk but in Act 2 he is using bottles instead of delivering and measuring bulk milk with his quaint measuring contraption. Mrs. Gibbs never made it to Paris.We learn also that George has been an outstanding baseball player for the town team and that his marriage will interrupt that.The narrator announces that before we see the wedding well have a flashback to the day when George and Emily decide they were meant for each other.The conversation is initiated by George on the way home from school as he offers to carry Emilys books. She complains that he has changed neglecting her in favor of a consuming interest in baseball yet she has been watching him all year long from a distance. He accepts the criticism and assures her by saying that he too has watched her from a distance the whole year long. They are both sweet and innocent and halting and tentative and struggle with their nerves.He invites her to go into the drugstore for an ice cream soda she accepts and there he discusses what he will do after graduation. He will take over his uncles farm doesnt want to go to Agricultural school as he prefers to start his work life right away and not spend years away from Emily. Finally he hems and haws and never quite comes out with saying he loves Emily until she gets so frustrated she blurts out that she knows he loves her and she loves him back.Flash forward to the archetypal wedding day. George wants to see Emily but others insist that the groom must not see the bride on the wedding day until the ceremony. There are concerns about the wedding dress. Emily is scared about the finality of the decision. The parents reminisce about their own wedding days. Dr. Gibbs tells anecdotes about his fears and cold feet.There is a comical conversation between George and Mr. Webb about advice he had received from his own father in law about how the man should go about taking the upper hand in the matrimonial relationship.Like a proverbial mother in law Mrs. Gibbs voices her concerns that Emily is too young to understand how she needs to take care of George and just about predicts he will be dead of pneumonia by the end of the winter.At the church the other townspeople comment on how nice the wedding is how beautiful the bride looks how weddings are so important and how they always cry at weddings. And the wedding proceeds without a hitch.Act 3 taking place supposedly in 1913 is retrospective and philosophical. Birth life and death flow on in Grovers Corners like water on a river always moving but the river stays the same or changes ever so slowly.We are shown images that tell us Emily has died after giving birth to her second child and of her funeral. During and after her funeral her ghost converses with other ghosts of dead persons in the Grovers Corners cemetery.Emily is the newcomer. The others ghosts mostly just sit there and watch and occasionally talk to each other. Her questions are answered ambiguously. The ghosts are unemotional observers commenting on how old so and so looks now. Among the dead are Mr. Stimson the church organist who committed suicide by hanging himself and whose suicide was covered up. Also among the dead are cheery neighbors who attended Emilys wedding and Mrs. Gibbs.A frequent phrase the ghosts say about the living is They just don't understand do they the poor dears. The message they want understood by the living is that life and every last minute every precious breath is not to be wasted and squandered regardless of how ordinary and unimportant it may seem. They have vague regrets about their relationships with others while they were alive but arent that interested any more.Emily gets special permission to go back and re-live just one day of her life. She decides after getting advice from the other dead folk to re-live one quite ordinary day and she re-lives her sixteenth birthday She is very excited at experiencing that one day but finds in the end it's not what she thought it would be. It goes too fast and people don't have time to look at one another they are impatient with one another.""This is the way we were: in our growing up and in our marrying and in our living and in our dying."" The nostalgic problem-free life of WASP America between the Spanish American War and the First World War was a flawed paradise.EPILOGUE: Emily wakes up from the temporary coma resulting from the birthing of her second child. She is not dead. Act 3 was all a dream."

Mr. Morgan the town druggist acts the the Everyman to tell the story of his town Grover's Corners New Hampshire which in turn acts as the Anyplace. The story he tells is one of life love and death universal to anywhere in the world. He starts the story in 1901 solely to set the stage. Dr. Frank and Julia Gibbs and Charles and Myrtle Webb have been long time friends and next door neighbors. The Webb's oldest offspring Emily Webb in her mid to late teens is an academically bright girl. The Gibbs' oldest offspring George Gibbs also in his mid to late teens has focused his energies in life thus far on baseball. But he begins to think about his future wanting to be a farmer he being told that he can work for his Uncle Luke and eventually inherit the farm if he's any good at it. While Emily has always been secretly in love with George George begins to notice Emily romantically for the first time although he in turn doesn't tell her of his feelings for her. Mr. Morgan then moves the story to 1904 just before George and Emily are about to get married he providing some background as to the less than smooth road to them being a couple and their current doubts about what being married and being a grown-up mean. The last phase of the story takes place in 1913 when Emily is about to give birth to her and George's second child. In the process Emily reflects on her life and thinks about loved ones that are no longer in the world making her wish she had seized the happy moments in life when they happened.::Huggo

"One of the few (if any at the time this film was made) films shot in England with New York City's 'Little Italy"" as the locale. This was Edward Dmytryk's first film after he had refused to tell a Congressional Committee whether or not he was or had ever been a member of the Communist Party. This is a 'runaway production' shot in England for political reasons and not for the usual USA tax-break reasons. Geremio a young Italian immigrant to New York City works as a bricklayer and is courting an Italian girl Annunziata by mail. He lies to her that he owns his own home and after they are married has to rent one for their three-day honeymoon. The years pass and they are unable to save enough money to get out of their slum tenement and the 1929 depression brings even harder times to the family that now includes three children. Geremio in order to make enough money to care for his family exploits his ""comrades"" in dangerous construction work. This practice leads to the accidental death of his best friend and in grief Geremio also becomes unfaithful to his wife. The messages of the film -- life is aimless and no man can judge the true worth of another man -- are pounded on for most of the two-hour running time.::Les Adams <longhorn1939@suddenlink.net>"

When they check into a hotel Damir registers them as a married couple and Anastasia is surprised the clerk believes his lie. They eat dinner at a restaurant asking for the meals that tourists prefer.In the hotel Anastasia is excited about the bathtub but she is self-conscious about her breasts. Insisting that she is not a little girl anymore Anastasia asks Damir to leave the bathroom so she can have some privacy. He teases that she is not a woman yet but complies. Later Anastasia wonders if they should sleep in the same bed since they are not actually brother and sister but Damir laughs and she joins him in the bed.When they return to their home the next day a photographer takes pictures of them rowing to shore and asks for more photographs.

She declares that she is a woman now and they cannot live together unless they are married. Damir argues that they are brother and sister but she reminds him that he is not a blood relative; they were orphans raised together. Damir discusses the situation with the mayor who agrees that a man and woman cannot live together unless they are ""blooded"" or married.

When Damir returns that evening he bathes in the ocean and pulls Anastasia into the water. He rips off her shirt and uses it to wash the makeup off her face. She is furious and insists she will never speak to him again.Anastasia and the islanders continue their work while Damir unearths the sarcophagus. As Damir starts the arduous process of moving the sarcophagus into town Anastasia strolls up the hill to investigate. Refusing to let her see the sarcophagus Damir leaves it on the hill and takes her back to town.That evening the islanders gather to watch another movie.

Madison Indiana 1971. The Ohio river port is in full economic decline its last pride and obsession being its uniquely town-owned power boat although the raggedy old donation from a millionaire decades ago never comes close to a win. With his doted upon son Mike as most devoted fan air-conditioner repairman Jim McCormick who had to stop piloting it after a near-fatal accident devotes all his 'spare' time to it turning down professional opportunities as that would mean moving as his wife suggests. Things climax when he realizes the town will either be scrapped from the national racing circuit or host the Gold Cup itself requiring $50000 fund raising.::KGF Vissers
Mike McCormick recounts his life in the summer of 1971 when he was a ten year old adolescent living in the town of Madison Indiana on the northern banks of the Ohio River. Madison was once the busiest port upstream of New Orleans but it had since hit hard times with many people choosing to leave for greener pastures. Mike's father Jim McCormick still had his HVAC job but would not have it much longer if the town's economy did not take a drastic turn for the better. Madison had a rich history in competitive boat racing having hosted the first ever such race in the United States. Hydroplaning was like a religion in town Madison being the only community worldwide that owned its own competitive hydroplane the Miss Madison whereas all other boats were corporate owned or sponsored. Madison also was one of only six stops on the hydroplane racing circuit. Jim once piloted the Miss Madison but a racing accident in 1961 that injured him and killed his best friend a fellow pilot ended his racing career. He had since worked behind the scenes for the team but was getting more and more involved - as his teammates left town - to the point of being head of the team in 1971. This focus on racing exasperated Mike's mother Bonnie McCormick who wanted Jim to focus more on their family which meant leaving Madison for a more stable and thus better life. The American Power Boat Association (APBA) chose by lottery Madison to host the Gold Cup Championship race that year the most prestigious race on the circuit. This choice was not a done deal as the town had to put up a $50000 deposit money which it did not have. In addition Jim was determined to get the Miss Madison in shape for the Gold Cup despite her twelve year old age the battering she took in season races and the team having neither the time money or technological expertise to make the necessary repairs to get her near the quality of other newer boats. And other issues made Jim have to make the decision if he would once again get behind the wheel competitively.

In this wartime MGM short the Devil makes mischief with the U.S. economy. It's 5 months since the U.S. entered World War II and Adolf Hitler telephones the Devil for his help. No problem says the Devil he will get Americans to buy on credit break rationing laws hoard as much as they can and cash in their war bonds. It includes a clip from President Franklin Delano Roosevelt asking people to buy bonds and act in the best interest of the country.::garykmcd
In conjunction with his disciple Adolf Hitler the Devil has been causing havoc for the Allied forces in the lead up to and during WWII with major offensives in Shanghai Rotterdam and Poland among others. Following a discussion with Hitler the Devil believes their next target should be the United States a recent addition to the Allied forces. Based on historical precedents he feels the best way to destroy the US is by destroying their wartime economy by causing inflation through getting the US populace to purchase uncontrollably as a collective on non-war related items leading to higher prices on already scarce goods while the government focuses on wartime production. Other side measures the Devil will foster in the US include hoarding cashing in of government bonds manufacturers evading ceiling prices and a build up of a black market economy. The only way the Americans can survive this attack by the Devil is to implement non-inflationary government policies and have an educated populace who are taught the problems that will occur for the US if they partake in what is unknown to them as the Devil's economic activities.::Huggo
The Devil receives a telephone call from Adolf Hitler who asks for the Devil's help in the war effort. The Devil tells Hitler that he will cause high inflation in the USA and his worries will be over. He encourages the audience to buy as much as they can so that goods will become scarce and prices will go up. Hoarding rationed goods and cashing in war bonds will also help. Factory worker Joe Smith just got a raise in pay so he starts buying everything on the installment plan including a fur coat for his wife. After the Smiths hear a radio address by President Roosevelt they realize that they should be more prudent in their spending habits to help the war effort.::David Glagovsky <dglagovsky@prodigy.net>

"PHANTOM LOVE is a surreal highly visual drama about an enmeshed family in which violence and trauma are steadily percolating just beneath the surface.
The lead character is LULU (Marina Shoif): a very beautiful but angry and isolated woman who lives alone and works in a casino in Korea-town Los Angeles. Lulus lover is much younger than herselfthe relationship is charged but emotionally disconnected. Lulus younger sister NITZAN (Juliette Marquis) is in the midst of a psychotic breakdown caused in part by prescription medication. Lulu feels emotionally invaded by her mother who wants to come to town and stay in Lulus apartment in order to try and help the younger sisterbut this feels like a further intense invasion and Lulu refuses.
PHANTOM LOVE weaves these various elements together into a strange but archetypal story revealing the interior processes by which Lulu manages to see and therefore begin to release herself from the violence which surrounds her.
Like all Nina Menkess work PHANTOM LOVE positions an alienated woman against a harsh inhospitable landscapethis time within a family. Stylistically the film combines fairy-tale elements and a dreamy mystical quality with a gritty hyper-real and sometimes almost documentary style shooting everything on location and often using non-actors (real people) in the non-major roles.
Structured like Chinese boxes with each scene opening onto another still deeper inside PHANTOM LOVE is a powerful document about one womans descent into self."

"In the opening prologue a narrator goes over three events of incredible coincidence:1) Sir Edmund William Godfrey a resident of Greenberry Hill London was killed by three vagrants looking to rob his pharmacy. The surnames of these men were Green Berry and Hill.2) Reno blackjack dealer Delmer Darion went scuba diving in a lake and was accidentally picked up by a firefighting plane in order to put out a nearby forest fire. Darion died of a heart attack inside the plane. The plane's pilot Craig Hansen had gotten into a fight with Darion two days prior at a casino. The guilt and measure of coincidence eventually prompted him to commit suicide.3) 17-year-old Sydney Barringer attempted suicide by jumping off the roof of his Los Angeles apartment building. Meanwhile his parents Faye and Arthur were arguing inside their apartment. Faye threatened Arthur with a shotgun and accidentally fired at the window just as Sydney passed killing him. There was a safety net that would have saved Sydney's life had he not been shot. His parents hadn't known the gun was loaded; Sydney had loaded it himself a few days earlier hoping one would kill the other. Faye was arrested for murder and Sydney himself noted as an accomplice in his own death.San Fernando Valley present day:Claudia Wilson Gator a depressed and seemingly bipolar cocaine addict meets a man at a bar. They have sex at her apartment. The next morning Claudia's father game show host Jimmy Gator pays a visit. He tells Claudia that he has bone cancer and that he's going to die soon. Claudia doesn't seem to care and furiously yells him out of the house. The man from the bar leaves as well.That same morning Nurse Phil Parma arrives at a large house to look after Earl Partridge an elderly television mogul who's dying of brain and lung cancer. Linda Partridge Earl's much younger trophy wife leaves to see Earl's doctor who writes a prescription for a potent morphine painkiller that can diminish Earl's suffering. Meanwhile Earl tells Phil that he has a son: sex guru Frank 'T.J.' Mackey (born Jack Partridge). Earl wants to see Frank before he dies and Phil attempts to contact him.Frank is currently leading an enthusiastic seminar for his program ""Seduce and Destroy"" which can enable men to use women for sex. A reporter named Gwenovier arrives at the studio to interview Frank later.Quiz Kid Donnie Smith who as a child won a large amount of money on Jimmy Gator's show ""What Do Kids Know?"" (of which Earl Partridge happens to be a producer) now works at an electronics store. However his bosses fire him since his sales are down. He pleads with them as he needs to pay for dental braces (which he doesn't need; his teeth are straight) but they force Donnie to hand over his keys to the store.Jim Kurring a religious police officer who is divorced and looking for a relationship answers a noise complaint and finds a dead body inside a woman's closet. Though he was first on the scene he is later ignored as his superior questions his fellow officers. Outside he meets a young boy named Dixon who recites a rap referencing ""the Worm"" and God bringing rain in. Jim dismisses this as nonsense and drives off.Stanley Spector a child genius and current long-running contestant on ""What Do Kids Know?"" is picked up from school by his avaricious actor father Rick and driven to the game show studio to win some more money. Stanley seems reluctant.Afternoon (it starts raining):""What Do Kids Know?"" pits a panel of three children against one of three adults through a series of trivia questions. Stanley and his two co-contestants are minor celebrities thanks to their tenure on the show (in actuality Stanley's co-contestants barely do anything; Stanley himself is the main reason this panel has lasted so long). Jimmy downs several shots of alcohol before the live taping. The show starts at 3:30 PM and as usual Stanley expertly answers Jimmy's questions putting the kids ahead of the adults. During a commercial break Stanley asks to go to the bathroom but he is denied this request.Officer Jim answers a noise complaint at Claudia's apartment where she is playing her music too loudly. After hiding her cocaine she opens the door and Jim is immediately smitten with her. He takes a look around and decides not to write her up but not wanting to leave yet he makes casual conversation with her.Donnie enters a bar (the same one where Claudia was the previous night) where it is revealed why he wants braces: he is desperate to connect with his crush Brad the bartender who wears braces. Donnie drinks heavily after Brad seemingly flirts with another patron named Thurston Howell. He later starts up a conversation with Howell lamenting on love as well as the fact that his parents abandoned him after taking all of his game show money.Linda goes to a pharmacy to pick up some medication including Earl's morphine. The pharmacist tries making idle conversation with her but she eventually finds his questions too personal and launches into a furious tirade before leaving with the medication.Phil orders some pornographic magazines to find the number of ""Seduce and Destroy."" He calls and tries to make his way through to Frank. Later one of Earl's dogs eats some medication pills that Phil accidentally spilled.The seminar takes a break as Gwenovier interviews Frank. The interview turns hostile when she questions him about his father Earl whom he earlier lied was dead. After going over how Earl abandoned his first wife Lily when she became ill and of how a young Frank had to take care of her as she lay on her deathbed Gwenovier asks Frank why he lied.Late afternoon to nightfall:Linda tells her lawyer that she wants to change Earl's will; she reveals that she has cheated on Earl many times and only started to love him when he was diagnosed with cancer. The lawyer says she can't change the will but she can renounce it. Linda can't do that as the money would then go to Frank (Earl has lied to her about his relationship with Frank blaming his son for the distance between them). Frustrated she returns home. She attempts suicide in the garage via carbon monoxide but stops herself to bring the morphine inside.A drunken Donnie confesses his feelings to Brad and vomits in the bathroom. He later returns home and gathers some secretly-made spare keys to his former employers' store planning to rob the money for the braces.Realizing that the people around him are using him for money or publicity Stanley stops answering questions which lets the adult panel get ahead. He wets his pants during a round while Jimmy collapses from his deteriorating condition. Jimmy recovers but Stanley refuses to get up for the final round and instead goes into a rant about how people look at him just because of his age and intelligence. The show is forced to end without a clear winner (though it is implied that the adults win thanks to their accumulated score). Rick is furious. Stanley flees the studio and breaks into his school library hiding there and perusing books about child geniuses for the rest of the night. Jimmy returns home to his wife Rose.Officer Jim leaves the apartment but not before arranging a date with Claudia later that night. After he leaves Claudia puts the cocaine back on her table and turns on the TV to watch ""What Do Kids Know?"" just in time to catch Stanley's rant. As the show ends Claudia cries for an unclear reason.While driving Jim spots a suspicious man (known by his criminal nickname ""the Worm"") and takes chase. The Worm shoots at Jim while Dixon runs in and steals Jim's gun. Both Dixon and the Worm flee and Jim becomes a laughingstock among his fellow officers for having lost his gun. He returns home to get ready for his date.As Phil gets in touch with Frank's assistant a cold and indignant Frank stays mostly silent throughout the rest of the interview. Afterwards Frank deliberates over whether to take Phil's call. Linda enters the house and upon learning who Phil is calling violently forces him to hang up. Frank decides not to speak with Phil and hangs up as well. The seminar continues but Frank's now-troubled mindset causes him to make an error and lose his temper. After the seminar he changes his mind and drives to Earl's house though he hesitates to go inside.After a tearful apology to Phil Linda leaves to commit suicide. She parks at another location and takes some medication with alcohol while Earl laments to Phil about the regret that has tortured him over his son and first wife (Earl was extremely unfaithful to Lily mirroring Linda). Phil then gives Earl the morphine.What follows is a bizarre somber sequence where the nine main characters sing along to Aimee Mann's ""Wise Up.""Night (it stops raining):Claudia and Jim go to a restaurant. The date goes bad when following a kiss Claudia's neurotic self-hatred causes her to break down and leave without Jim. She takes a taxi home.Jimmy admits to Rose that he has cheated on her in the past. They later talk about Claudia and he implies (but never openly admits) that the reason she hates him is that he molested her. Disgusted and outraged Rose leaves the house yelling that Jimmy deserves to die alone. Jimmy then takes out a gun and prepares to end his life.Linda's dying body is found by Dixon who steals her money and calls 911. An ambulance takes her and heads for the hospital while nearby Dixon counts his cash and recites his rap again.Frank enters the house and speaks to Earl (who is unresponsive because of the morphine) as Phil watches solemnly. Though silently hostile at first Frank soon breaks down in tears and begs Earl not to go away.Donnie successfully robs the store and leaves though one of his keys breaks off in the door. The weight of his act later hits him and he decides to return the money. Since his key is broken he tries to access another entrance by climbing an adjacent telephone pole.Jim drives by and sees Donnie climbing the phone pole. He turns around to arrest Donnie but stops when it begins to rain frogs. One frog hits Donnie who falls off the pole and injures his teeth on the pavement.The frogs start falling as Claudia snorts coke in her apartment. After crashing her car due to the frogs Rose arrives and comforts her frightened daughter.The frogs cause Linda's ambulance to tip over during the drive just as it arrives at the hospital.A frog falls through Jimmy's ceiling and lands on his head causing him to accidentally shoot a TV. He falls unconscious as a spark from the gunshot starts a fire...From inside the library Stanley watches the frog storm smiles and calmly comments that ""This is something that happens.""As Phil gazes at the frogs Earl wakes up sees Frank and struggles to say something. Before he can utter a coherent word he dies.The next morning:Stanley returns home and wakes Rick who apparently has not tried very hard to find his son. Stanley tells Rick to be nicer to him but Rick coldly tells him to go to bed.Earl's body is taken away along with that of the dog who ate his pills. Phil cries as he makes Earl's now-empty bed. When the hospital calls Frank heads there to see Linda who is recovering.Jim gets his gun back when it drops from the sky. After hearing his story he decides not to arrest Donnie and the two enter the store and put the money back though Donnie now does need braces. After helping clean the frogs off of Donnie's car he refers Donnie to someone who can correct his teeth. After Donnie leaves Jim sits in his car and monologues about his duty as a policeman and about knowing when to forgive people.Rose goes to answer the door as Claudia sits in bed. Jim soon enters the room and talks to Claudia making a speech about how he will love and accept her for who she is. During the speech Claudia looks sad and uncertain but afterward she breaks the fourth wall and smiles at the viewer."

This is by far the best version of Les Misérables ever made in my opinion and the critics. Charles Laughton makes this movie but literally every scene and every character add to this amazing film. If you have never seen a Charles Laughton movie this one will get you hooked. His portrayal of Inspector Javert is 2nd to none. He tracks the wanted man Jean Valjean throughout the movie and the twists and turns are so well done even you movie buffs will not see what's coming. The movie takes you through Valjeans life and many crossroads that shape his life. My words don't do this movie justice. This is a must see Drama. The scene with the priest always gets to me be sure to catch all the dialog. This movie will make you laugh though it is not a comedy. It will make you mad. It will move your heart in a good way. You will become many of the characters as you watch the film. The less you know about the film the better in my opinion which is why my summary is so vague on details. You can only see a movie for the first time once so enjoy it. I know I did. And this is one of those you can see over and over through the years and it always gives you something more.::MarkMann

Kiril says that he kept a steadfast faith but that he has only worked as a priest for his fellow prisoners so is not prepared for the position. The Pope insists so Kiril has not option but to obey.George himself has a complex personal life with a very jealous wife Dr Ruth Faber (Barbara Jefford) who wants him to get rid of his lover Chiara (Rosemary Dexter). A tense moment happens when the nosy Marchesa (Isa Miranda) tells Chiara to settle down and get married during a high-class party.Kiril tells David that he didn't see much conventional faith in his book. However David insists in his views: he wants to remain a priest and is trying to fulfill his last years alive with purpose. David answers to the court who is judging him. During the interrogatory he stresses that the design of God includes evil acts according to him. However there is no verdict as news arrives that the Pope has collapsed. George is the first who gives live the news that the Pope has died. Everybody wonders who the next Pope will be. The two most thought-of candidates Cardinal Rinaldi (Vittorio De Sica) and Cardinal Leone (Leo McKern) do not deem themselves worthy of the position as they are too old and a bit old-fashioned. They need new blood and new ideas for the 20th Century. After the burial of the Pope in three coffins one inside another all the cardinals of the church move behind locked doors until they have chosen a new pope.Kiril insists on taking David as his secretary although it's David himself who points to the fact of the ongoing court -the decision will be taken as soon as the new Pope is elected- and he believes the verdict will be against him but Kiril insists. They joke that the only sure thing is that the next pope would be Italian.A crowd starts gathering around Saint Peter's while all the rituals before the votation are completed: the locking of doors the gathering of all the cardinals. Neither Leone nor Rinaldi are able to get enough votes to be elected. As the 6th vote -at two votes per day that means three days later- still shows no decisive solution George and other people wonder how long it may take to elect someone. Even Kamenev watches George on the news. They wonder also what Cardinal will be elected as the right person could help them to their own ends. Kamenev admits that the situation in China could blow the world out. His assistant laughs because he is asking magic to solve his problems. Kamenev says that he has run out of maths and facts.In one of the meetings between votes Kiril says that Communism has become really conservative. Some cardinals are afraid of revolutions and Kiril is the only one who admits violence as a means to certain ends and social justice. Questioned further he admits that he stole bread in the Siberian camp to feed a fellow prisoner with a broken jaw and he almost killed the guard who attacked that prisoner. When questioned how he would have felt if he had killed that guard he says that he doesn't know but insists that sometimes violence may be the only way out.When nighttime arrives and everybody goes to sleep Kiril keeps on praying tormented by his memories.The next day after the 7th vote having been void as well Cardinal Rinaldi (Vittorio de Sica) takes a privilege of church law to openly proclaim Kiril Lakota as his choice. Lakota Rinaldi says has preached and suffered imprisonment because of his faith and he has the strength of personality to adapt the doctrine of the Catholic faith to modern times. Although Lakota is reluctant other cardinals join in the proclamation and Cardinals stand up and finally Lakota accepts.Gelasio (Arnodo Foà) has set out three robes as is the custom to accommodate the newly elected pope whatever his size. David feels completely shocked when he with all the rest of secretaries sees Kiril as the new Pope. Kiril chooses his own name to carry as it was the name of the first preacher who ""carried the Gospel"" into Ukraine.All the public falls silent when they see it's Kiril. Then the public cheers and Faber says that with the world on the verge of a crisis it's impossible to know what the possible ramifications may be in the future.INTERMISSION - ENTR'ACTEKiril wants to keep David close to him although the rest of the cardinals disagree. Kiril thinks he's an honest man in spite of his wrong opinions. He also wants time to act and pray changing things. Igor Bounin (Frank Finlay) comes to talk to him with a gift from Kamenev some sunflower seeds. Kamenev still thinks that Kiril could see the right word at the right place. Bounin under other name was one of the torturers of Kiril under his interrogation. Bounin on behalf of Kamenev says that in two months' time there will be war and that the only solution is that Kiril speaks to China on behalf of the Western countries and to the Western countries in behalf of China. Kiril dictates his answer: it's a risky thing to do and needs more time to think about it.Chiara meets George at the zoo. His wife has followed them there and sees them together.Kiril wants to talk with Gelasio who's always busy with housekeeping. Gelasio says that Rome inhabitants will make jokes about the foreign pope but in time they will get used to it. Kiril has an idea and asks Gelasio to give him a black dress and beret like a normal priest. Kiril goes out to visit Rome and sees a painter painting the heavy traffic people going out having fun the poor noisy neighborhoods where Dr Ruth Faber almost runs him over. She asks him to go the a chemist's nearby for some medicines. He goes but hasn't got any money to pay. The pharmacist trusts him and gives him the medicines. The dying man and his family (Leopoldo Trieste) is a Jew so he prays in the typical Hebrew way. Kiril and Ruth bade goodbye and he says ""shalom"" to everybody. Kiril used to work with a rabbi in the Siberian camp. On their way out they see a couple kissing and caressing. Ruth is only worried about his failing marriage. They talk. He tells him to find the love she used to feel. However the Pope's security is awaiting outside so they can't go have dinner.When Ruth arrives home George is packing. All correspondents have been called to Paris. Meanwhile the Cardinals advice Kiril to wait but he doesn't want to delay. David has to answer the Cardinal's court. David seems to go dizzy when trying to answer. (He is actually fatally ill; he has an inoperable aneurysm in his brain.) David's concept of Christ is different. They ask David Telemond to put his beliefs in a clear statement. He says he also believes in the world. Kiril himself will tell David that the court has decided that his opinions are not to be divulged and are dangerous. David is completely frustrated because he has been condemned to silence. Kiril orders him to get medical care and stay silent. David says that he hates and loves the church at the same time.Kiril dresses in civil clothes to meet with Peng (Burt Kwouk) the Chinese leader and Kamenev. Kamenev says that Kiril cannot be too humble or too proud. Kiril says he'll try to make peace and open the markets of surrounding countries for China. Peng asks for Kiril to risk something if he fails.Back in Rome Kiril asks for David's help. Kiril says that he should have not accepted. Kiril prays and says that his only consolation is that he cannot be mistaken no matter what folly he commits. David says that he has no grudge against Kiril although he'll still hold his beliefs. As they pray David suddenly collapses clutching his head and screaming. His brain aneurysm has burst. He dies offscreen as the Pope picks him up and rushes him to the infirmary.Cardinal Leone feeling guilty about the way he treated David asks Kiril to hear his confession. Leone admits he was jealous of David because Kiril loved and trusted him. Kiril admits he kept Leone at a distance because Leone opposed him. Leone says that Kiril must act but he shouldn't expect approval or understanding. All popes felt lonely when they had to make decisions. Leone says that it can't be avoided.George is the reporter on the coronation of Kiril. All cardinals oppose Kiril's idea. Kiril offers his abdicadtion. Leone immediately says no.Immediately after being crowned Kiril pledges all the wealth of the church to pay for food for China's people."

Returning to the pool hall Bigger fights Gus for being late and blames him for having to postpone the robbery.Bigger takes Chicago's elevated train to Henry Dalton's mansion. Peggy (Geraldine Page) the Daltons' Irish housekeeper ushers him into the living room where Henry Dalton and his blind wife Elaine (Caroll Baker) greet him. Asked how far he went in school Bigger admits he has only an eighth-grade education. Elaine hopes he can return to school while he works there. Peggy feeds Bigger and tells him the Daltons are generous liberal employers. Their daughter Mary (Elizabeth McGovern) has just returned from Europe Peggy informs him and worries her parents because she hangs around with Communists. Peggy shows Bigger how the furnace works and how he needs to regularly remove ashes. Bigger puts his gun under the mattress of the bed in his new room.Later dressed in a chauffeur's uniform Bigger drives Mary to her school but Mary instructs him to take her downtown instead and asks him not to tell her parents because she is on the ""same side"" as Bigger. Mary introduces Bigger to her boyfriend Jan Erlone (Matt Dillion) a local left-wing activist who demands to drive the car and show Bigger they are social equals. The two privileged white teenagers talk about a coming revolution and act as if Bigger is in collusion with them. They browbeat him into taking them to Ernie's Kitchen Shack in the black section of town where the black staff and clientele are dismayed by the presence of white people and Bigger is embarrassed. When Bessie Mears enters Bigger ignores her. As he reluctantly answers questions about his life Mary and Jan are shocked that nobody was punished for his father's lynching in the Deep South 12 years earlier.On the way home Jan and Mary drunkenly sing ""Swing Low Sweet Chariot."" When Bigger drops Jan at a train station the young man gives him Communist pamphlets. By the time Bigger returns to the Dalton mansion Mary has to be carried to her room. As Bigger lays her on her bed she clings to him. Suddenly Elaine Dalton enters the room calling to Mary. Bigger places a pillow over Mary's face to quiet her until her blind mother leaves but when he removes the pillow Mary is dead. Aware that he will not receive justice for this Bigger carries her body to the basement and burns it in the furnace then walks to the train station and goes home to tell his happy mother he got the job.Returning to the Dalton home in the early morning Bigger finds Peggy in the basement ready to put coal in the furnace so he volunteers to do it instead. Peggy tells Bigger he has to take Mary to the train station for her trip to Detroit Michigan. Bigger hurries to his room vomits and hides Jan's Communist pamphlets in a drawer. Though Peggy cannot find Mary in her room she tells Bigger to drive her trunk to the station and then he can take the day off. Bigger returns to his neighborhood and visits Bessie's apartment. She is angry that he ignored her at Ernie's and hints at her fears about his angry outbursts.Later at the Dalton house Peggy instructs Bigger to retrieve the trunk he left at the station because Mary never arrived in Detroit. In the basement Mr. Dalton introduces Bigger to Mr. Britton a private investigator. Britton asks Bigger when he took Mary to school then smashes a piece of wood against his chair when he fails to speak up. Bigger confesses that Mary ordered him to drive to the Labor Defenders office on Lake Street to pick up her boyfriend Jan. After driving around they got drunk at a place on the South Side and Bigger took them home around 2:00 a.m.Later the detective brings Jan Erlone to Bigger's room. Jan admits being with Mary but says they were not drunk and he did not bring her home. Henry Dalton offers to pay Jan for information about Mary's whereabouts but the young man walks out. After the others leave Bigger gets his pistol and walks to the station but Jan stops him on the way and asks what Dalton and Britton said to make Bigger turn against him. Bigger draws his gun and tells Jan to leave him alone.Bigger runs to Bessie's apartment and prints a ransom note to let the Daltons know Mary is safe. Bigger slides the note under the Daltons' front door. Peggy finds the note and gives it to Mr. Dalton who gathers several reporters in the basement for a press conference. Peggy informs Bigger he needs to clean the furnace because the house is getting cold but when he opens the furnace it is choked from ashes and smoke pours out. The reporters find bones and an earring inside and Bigger flees the house.On the street he hears radio reports that police are combing the South Side for a Negro ""rapist"" and murderer. Fleeing to a rooftop Bigger is trapped by vigilantes knocked off a water tower by a fireman's hose and thrown in jail. After several days Jan Erlone visits Bigger's cell and asks why he killed Mary. Jan admits having no idea how socially ""far apart"" they were when he and Mary forced themselves on him. Jan offers to introduce Bigger to Max (John Karlen) an attorney friend from the pro-Marxist Labor Defenders who wants to represent him in court. Then the racist assistant district attorney Buckley (David Rasche) enters the cell to tell Bigger he has enough evidence to put him in ""a dozen electric chairs.""At the inquest the Daltons ask Bigger to confess who helped him kill Mary. Mama gives Bigger a crucifix and begs him to ""go to God."" She humiliates Bigger by kneeling and pleading with the Daltons to stop the law from killing her boy. Buckley tries to soften Bigger by telling him he knows how it feels to be a ""colored man"" cut off from society but when the assistant district attorney mentions rape Bigger yells that he did not rape Mary. Bigger insists that Jan had nothing to do with killing Mary or writing the ransom note. At night a lynch mob of white men outside Bigger's jail burn a cross and scream racial slurs.The next morning Max enters Bigger's cell and asks about the murder Bigger explains that Mary's death was an accident and he did not rape her. However he admits to hating the rich young woman because she presumed to be his friend. Max tries to explain that Mary was naive and innocent. Max explains that all Bigger had to do was let Mrs. Dalton know at the time that he was bringing Mary to her room but Bigger claims he was ""dead"" the moment he stepped into that room.During the trial the district attorney tries to implicate Jan by saying his Communist pamphlets inspired Bigger to rape and kill Mary. In her testimony the racist Peggy blames Mama Thomas for improperly raising her son. In his testimony Bigger tells Max in open court that he blames society for the way it treats Negroes. During a break in the trial Jan privately apologizes to Bigger for patronizing him and not appreciating who he really was. Predictably Bigger is found guilty of murder by the racist all-white jury and immediately is sentenced to death.A few days later Max pays Bigger a visit to his cell on Death Row where he thanks Max for treating him like a man and a human being. Bigger claims he now sees himself and others as they are and knows the racist white people who convicted him hated him as much as he hated them. Bigger feels all right now because he understands and no longer afraid of death. He asks Max to let Mama know he did not cry and to tell Jan ""hello"". Max leaves the condemned man's cell."

Based on real life events that led to tragic deaths of Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria and his lover Baroness Mary Vetsera.::Anonymous
It's the late nineteenth century Austria. The Emperor Franz-Joseph and his son the Crown Prince Archduke Rudolf have never seen eye to eye. While the Emperor retains the traditions of the empire in the rapidly changing world keeping it a police state Rudolf is liberal wanting to see the people have a say in what happens in their lives. Rudolf even rejected the Emperor's choice of a Spanish wife for him he instead choosing Belgian Stephanie as his wife that marriage which he himself never saw and will never see as anything more than a political alliance Stephanie who he considers a shrew. While Rudolf has almost an unhealthy infatuation with his mother the Empress Elizabeth she has largely been an absent figure from Vienna and thus his life. As Franz-Joseph has had his steady mistress in Elizabeth's frequent absences he has allowed Rudolf to have the same in the form of actress Mitzi Kaspar as the Emperor knows she could never be more than a dalliance and as she retains a certain balance within the royal house.

"In the 1920s Jordan ""Bick"" Benedict Jr. (Rock Hudson) head of a wealthy Texas ranching family travels to Maryland to buy War Winds a horse he is planning to put out to stud. There he meets and courts socialite Leslie Lynnton (Elizabeth Taylor) who ends a budding relationship with English gentleman Sir David Karfrey (Rod Taylor) and marries Bick after a whirlwind romance.They return to Texas to start their life together on the family ranch Reata which is owned and run by Luz (Mercedes McCambridge) Bick's older and grumpy sister. Leslie doesn't get along with Luz for Luz scorns Leslie's wealthy background while Leslie thinks that Luz is rude. Jett Rink (James Dean) is a local ranch hand who works for Luz and hopes to find his fortune by leaving Texas; he also has a secret love for Leslie despite the fact that she is married to his boss.One day during a cattle roundup Luz expresses her hostility for Leslie by cruelly digging in her spurs while riding Leslie's beloved horse War Winds. Luz dies after War Winds bucks her off and as part of her will Jett is given a small plot of land within the 595000-acre Benedict ranch. Bick tries to buy back the land but Jett refuses. Jett keeps the fenced off waterhole as his home and names the property Little Reata.A few years later Leslie eventually gives birth to twins Jordan ""Jordy"" Benedict III (Dennis Hopper as a teenager and young adult) and Judy Benedict (Fran Bennett as a teen and young adult) and a younger daughter named Luz II (Carroll Baker as a teen and young adult).One day Jett discovers oil in a footprint left by Leslie and develops an oil drilling well on his property. Bick is annoyed with Jett's prospecting and tries to deny him access to his land. Finally Jett hits his first gusher he drives into the Benedict yard (covered in crude oil) proclaiming in front of the entire family that he will be richer than the Benedicts. After Jett makes a rude sexual remark to Leslie Bick and Jett have a fist fight.Shortly after in the 1930s Jett starts an oil drilling company named 'JetTexas' that makes him enormously wealthy. But Bick resists the lure of drilling for oil on his much larger part of the cattle ranch preferring to remain a rancher to maintain the legacy of his family's original business.During the 1940s tensions in the Benedict household revolve around how the parents want to bring up their grown-up children. Bick stubbornly insists that Jordy must succeed him and run the ranch just like his father and grandfather before him but Jordy wants to be a doctor. Leslie wants Judy to attend finishing school in Switzerland but Judy loves the ranch and wants to stay in Texas for her education (and to her high school boyfriend).After World War II breaks out Jett visits the Benedicts and tries to convince Bick to allow oil production on his land to help the war effort. Bick finally realizes there is no one to take over the ranch after him and concedes. During this visit Luz II now a teen-aged girl starts flirting with Jett. Once oil production starts the wealthy Benedict family becomes even wealthier depicted by the addition of a swimming pool next to the house. Jordy gets married to a young Mexican-American woman and they have a son. Judy gets married to her long-term high school boyfriend and they too have a son.The Benedict/Rink rivalry continues however and it comes to a head when the Benedicts find out that Luz II and the much older Jett Rink have been dating. At a huge gala Jett organizes in his own honor an irate Jordy tries to fight him after realizing he and his Mexican American wife Juana (Elsa Cárdenas) were invited just so Jett's employees could turn Juana away. Jett has his goons hold Jordy and punches him out in front of the crowd. Fed up Bick then takes Jett to a kitchen room about to fight him but realizes that Jett is now just a drunken shell of a man who has only his money. He tells him ""You're not even worth hitting. ... You're all through"" and leaves but not before symbolically and quite noisily caving in Rink's wine cellar shelves domino style. The party ends when Jett completely drunk slumps down in front of everyone before his big speech. Luz II sees him afterwards once everyone has left the ballroom and discovers that he is a lonely pathetic wreck who can only repeat how much he still loves Leslie.The Benedicts all except Jordy drive down an empty road to a diner. An altercation develops between the racist diner owner Sarge (Mickey Simpson) and Bick after he refuses to serve a non-English-speaking Mexican family that just walked in who have no dollars but pesos. Bick intervenes on behalf of the Mexican family. A fist fight ensues when Bick stands up for the immigrant family against the racist Sarge leaving Bick the loser who collapses over a table of pies. Sarge throws all of them out of the diner saying that it is his American free right to refuse service to people he does not like including paying customers.Later in the final scene back at the ranch Bick and Leslie watch their two grandchildren one biracial (Jordy and Juana's son) play in a crib and reflect on their life. Leslie tells Bick that she considered him to be her hero for the first time in her life after the fight in the diner something he always tried to do with his ranching heroics. Reflecting on the Benedict family's legacy Bick views it as a failure because their lives didn't turn out the way he planned but Leslie considers their version of the family to be a success. The final shot pans to the face of each child one white one Hispanic but both Texans.

"Ambitious Texas-style scale epic that traces the rising and falling fortunes of two generations of Texans. Miscegenation moral dissipation racism the oppression of women....a variety of topics are brought forth during the film's 201-minute running time. The core of the film is actually the relationship between Bick Benedict and his wife Leslie. It is through them that we follow the film's themes of generation conflict and social change. However it is Jett Rink whom audiences remember particularly in the early scenes when he is striding out on his small piece of land or when he comes to tell Benedict that ""my well came in big."" He puts his oily hand on one of the white columns of Benedict's porch and unemphatically crystallizes the theme of the film - the muddy thumb prints of materialism on the pillars of elegance and the coming of conflict between the aristocracy and the nouveau riche.

Giant promises to do so then asks Bleek for a loan to pay off his gambling debt. Bleek declines and later Giant is apprehended by two loan sharks Madlock (Samuel L. Jackson) and Rod (Leonard L. Thomas) who demand payment. Giant can't pay and gets his fingers broken. Later Giant tells Bleek that he fell off his bike on the ride home but Bleek does not believe him.

She tries to reject him but agrees to take him back when he begs her to save his life.A montage flashes through their wedding the birth of their son Miles (Jelani Asar Snipes) and Bleek teaching his son to play the trumpet. In the final scene of the movie Miles (Arnold Cromer) is ten years old and wants to go outside to play with his friends. Indigo wants him to finish practicing his trumpet lessons. However Bleek relents and allows his son to leave and play.

"The movie centers around the lives of Brad Cairn and Abby Cairn an affluent young stockbroker and his wife raising children in New York City. Their firstborn the nine-year-old Joshua (Jacob Kogan) is a frighteningly intelligent child - to such a degree that he thinks and acts decades ahead of his age. Nearly always clad in formal wear and demonstrating limitless brilliance as a pianist - with a marked predilection for ""dissonant"" classical pieces - Joshua gravitates toward his gay aesthete uncle (Dallas Roberts) as a close friend but distances himself from his immediate kin - particularly when Abby brings a newborn baby sister home from the hospital and unwisely alienates the young boy. As the days pass one at a time the mood at the house regresses from healthy and happy to strange unsettled and disorienting; meanwhile bizarre events transpire. As the baby's whines drive an already strained Abby to the point of a nervous breakdown Joshua devolves from eccentric to downright sociopathic behavior discarding all of his toys disemboweling a stuffed animal and killing off pets. Eventually family members also begin to suffer tragic fates - but the question of whether or not they are Joshua's fevered and psychotic doings or merely the result of happenstance is not answered until the shocking conclusion.In the last scene where the movie is concluded it is revealed through a song that Joshua composes impromptu that everything was part of his plan to drive his parents away as he wants to live with his uncle Ned. Everything includes playing wrong notes in the piano scaring the baby with a torch light at night stopping his mother's psychological medications killing the dog and his Guinea pig taping himself scaring the baby so that his father gets to see it killing his grandma forging drawings characteristic of abuse to drive the psychologists to the wrong conclusions and deliberately misbehaving in public so that his father loses control and beats him (probably for the first time ever) in public strengthening his case of abuse."

In a streetcar he encounters a racist trolley controller who wrongfully accuses him of having an invalid ticket. As the situation escalates Otomo head-butts the controller and flees. With the police on his heels Otomo decides to leave the country. He runs into a truck driver who is inclined to take Otomo to the Netherlands if he pays him 400 Deutsche Mark in advance - a load of money he doesn't have. His need of money leads to desperate measures but also to a new love. However Otomo's bloody final encounter with the police is not too far away.::Anonymous
Inspired by an illegal Black African immigrant named Otomo who struck a train conductor in Stuttgart in the morning after an argument about the validity of a train pass in a certain zone. Uncertainty about the pass and his past & future haunt the audience. He was caught on a bridge a few hours later. In this tale we first see him not get a temporary job because he does not have proper shoes. He moves on rather aimlessly when he encounters a train conductor who accuses him of having a ticket that is not valid past the next stop. They argue and Otomo head butts the conductor and runs away. We never know if the ticket was valid. Now that the police are looking for him he hides out for a while then tries to make his way to Holland. He stumbles across a trucker who will take him there for 400 Deutsche Mark. He has little time to come up with that kind of money but as luck would have it his desperation leads to an opportunity which then leads him to the known end of the real story.::Scott in Milwaukee WI USA

"The story takes place in the fertile eastern lands bordered by the Mediterranean Sea and kept by the gods. Within the cradle of ancient civilization empires are built wars fought alliances forged and heroes born.Agamemnon (Brian Cox) king of Mycenae has united most of Greece's kingdoms under his rule and now advances his army upon the nation of Thessaly hoping to include it in his collection of ever-growing conquests. King Triopas (Julian Glover) bargains with Agamemnon to each let one of their best fighters decide who wins the battle rather than engaging in open war. Triopas calls upon the giant Boagrius (Nathan Jones) while Agamemnon calls to Achilles but the legendary warrior is nowhere to be found. A messenger boy (Jacob Smith) is sent to fetch him and Agamemnon curses the stubborn nature of the fiercest warrior Greece has ever seen. A half-god and blessed with incomparable strength and skill Achilles lives to fight but he refuses to associate with Agamemnon preferring instead to seek his own destiny and be immortalized in history. Achilles easily defeats Boagrius sealing Agamemnon's control over the nation and calls out if there is anyone else worthy enough to fight him. Triopas offers the Scepter of Thessaly to Achilles to pass on to Agamemnon. Achilles refuses the request and stalks off.Meanwhile Prince Hector (Eric Bana) and Paris (Orlando Bloom) of Troy feast in the banquet hall of King Menelaus of Sparta (Brendan Gleeson) as honored guests and peace ambassadors to their home nation. However young Paris sneaks away to be with Menelaus' beautiful wife Helen (Diane Kruger) whom he loves dearly. He convinces her to come back with him to Troy stowing her away on his brother's ship. When Hector finds out he is clearly angry but it is too late to return to Sparta with Helen and seek pardon. Finding Helen gone Menelaus vows revenge on Troy and seeks the approval of his brother Agamemnon who is only too happy to oblige though Agamemnon's decision comes mostly from his desire to sack Troy the seemingly undefeatable city.Odysseus (Sean Bean) king of Ithaca and under command of Agamemnon goes to convince Achilles to accompany them in the conquest of Troy. He finds him sparring with his young cousin Patroclus (Garrett Hedlund) who is more than eager to join in the fighting. Achilles refuses to go despite Odysseus' assurance that this war will go down into history. Achilles later seeks advice from his mother the sea nymph Thetis (Julie Christie) who is gathering shells to make a new necklace for him. She tells him that if he chooses to stay home he will find a wife raise a family and die old and loved. If he goes to Troy he will find his eternal glory and history will remember his name for thousands of years. However should he go to Troy he is doomed to die and will never return.Meanwhile Hector and Paris return to Troy with Helen greeted warmly by their fellow Trojans. The city is guarded by a high thick wall that has remained impenetrable since its founding. They meet their father King Priam (Peter O'Toole) who welcomes Helen and praises her beauty. Hector is reunited with his wife Andromache (Saffron Burrows) and his infant son.Achilles decides to join Agamemnon's campaign against Troy but brings his own warriors the fierce and infamous Myrmidons led by Eudorus (Vincent Regan). Patroclus accompanies them as well. The Myrmidons prove to be faster rowers than the Greeks and arrive on the shores of Troy before anyone else. Achilles gives an impassioned speech to his men telling them that they will be immortalized in the campaign. Concerned for this cousin's safety and inexperience Achilles tells Patroclus to stay and watch the ship. The Myrmidons take the beach with ease and sack the Temple of Apollo where priestess and cousin of Hector and Paris Briseis (Rose Byrne) is taken captive. In a defiant move and despite a warning from Eudorus not to offend the gods Achilles decapitates the statue of Apollo. Prince Hector leads an offensive to keep the Greeks at bay and runs into the temple where Achilles confronts him but refuses to fight him. Achilles explains that their fight would be suited best in front of an audience and he allows Hector to leave.Briseis is brought to Achilles' hut as his prize. She berates him for killing priests of Apollo before he is summoned to see Agamemnon who is preparing to celebrate the victory. There tensions rise as Achilles and the king argue over claims to the victory. Agamemnon goes further by bringing in Briseis claiming her as his own spoil of war enraging Achilles. He threatens to fight for her but she angrily interjects saying that no one else will die for her. Achilles stays his blade to the surprise of Agamemnon. Achilles vows that Agamemnon will one day fall under his sword.That night Priam seeks the advice of his advisors and elders with his sons in attendance discussing how best to defend against the Greeks. Paris offers an alternative to bloodshed; he will fight Menelaus for Helen's hand. The winner will take her home and the loser will burn before nightfall. Later Priam speaks with Paris in a courtyard and admits that in all the wars hes fought for power or land a war fought for love makes more sense. He gives Paris the Sword of Troy forged at its founding and containing the history of their nation. He explains that as long as a Trojan wields it there is hope for their people.Hector goes to see his wife and son. She fears for his life and can't imagine living on without him. He comforts her before getting up to see his brother. In the halls he sees a cloaked figure and gives pursuit to find that it's Helen trying to leave the city. She is remorseful for being the sole reason so many Trojan men died that day but Hector tells her that returning to Menelaus will not end the war and that she is a princess of Troy now. Helen returns to Paris.The next day Agamemnon's army marches for Troy while Achilles still seething over his loss of Briseis watches from a nearby hill with his men. Hector and Paris ride out to meet Agamemnon and Menelaus before battle. Agamemnon demands that the Trojans return Helen to his brother and submit to his rule. Hector bravely rebuffs but Paris offers to fight Menelaus one-on-one hoping that will settle the dispute. While Agamemnon could care less about returning Helen to his brother he allows Menelaus the opportunity to issue revenge. The two begin their fight and Menelaus is clearly stronger. Paris fighting under his brother's advice of waiting until Menelaus tires is wounded and disarmed but before Menelaus can deliver a death blow ducks away and crawls back to his brother. Stunned at his cowardice Menelaus demands the fight to continue but Hector defends his brother and drives his sword through Menelaus killing him. Enraged Agamemnon charges forward with his army.Watching from his hilltop Achilles curses under his breath at Agamemnon's inability to keep his ranks in formation. Hector proves to be the more able warrior and overpowers the Greeks with his tactics. One of the strongest Greek warriors Ajax (Tyler Mane) is felled by Hector. Odysseus advises Agamemnon to fall back before he loses his entire army and the Greeks retreat to the beach where their archers provide defense.With Menelaus dead the primary reason for the assault on Troy is gone and Agamemnon struggles to think of a way to rally the troops to his cause. Odysseus suggests that Agamemnon put his reservations aside and enlist Achilles to fight again. Outside Briseis is tossed around between Greek soldiers having been given to them by Agamemnon. Before she can be cruelly branded Achilles steps in and takes her back to his hut. He gives her a wet cloth to clean with and some food. When she questions why he fights and defies the gods he shows her a more reflective side to his nature and explains that the gods are jealous of men for their short mortal lives. As such everything is more beautiful.Priam consults with his advisors again while Paris laments over his cowardice. Helen assures him that though Menelaus was a strong warrior she hated her life with him. She'd rather have someone to love and grow old with than to see him die on the battlefield. Hector advises his father that the Greeks underestimated Trojan strength and that they should not do the same. However General Glaucus (James Cosmo) wants to strike preemptively. High Priest Archeptolemus (Nigel Terry) claims Troy is favored by the gods citing bird omens. Despite Hector's warnings to keep behind their walls Priam favors his advisors and issues an attack before daybreak.As Achilles sleeps that night Briseis takes a dagger and holds it to his throat. Without opening his eyes he encourages her to kill him but she hesitates. They realize their feelings for each other and make love. Achilles decides that he's had enough of war and offers to take Briseis away from Troy. Afterwards he speaks with Eudorus and tells him that they will go home. Patroclus is devastated having hoped to take part in battle. Achilles returns to his hut.Just as dawn approaches the Trojan army led by Hector set up on the dunes and sent hundreds of lit arrows into the sand. The Greeks awake in time to see large balls of hay being rolled down the hill towards camp ignited in huge fireballs by the torched arrows. Banging their shields to intimidate their enemy the Trojans advance towards the Greek camp. Suddenly Achilles appears in his armor and rallies the troops to fight. Achilles fights his way towards Hector and the two engage in combat. Greeks and Trojans alike surround them edging them on until Hector slits Achilles' throat with a swift slash of his sword. Achilles falls gasping for breath while the Myrmidons look on in horror. But when Hector removes his helmet he discovers that the man he wounded is not Achilles but Patroclus. Hector repentant but resolute drives his sword into the boy's chest to finish him. He addresses Odysseus and tells him they've fought enough that day. Before leaving Odysseus tells Hector that Patroclus was Achilles' cousin.The Myrmidons return to camp as Achilles emerges from his tent. Seeing them battle-worn he asks why they disobeyed him. Eudorus laments that Patroclus disguised himself in Achilles' armor even moved like him and fell under Hector. Achilles is outraged and attacks Eudorus. Briseis tries to stop him but he throws her to the ground.Hector returns to his wife. He admits that he killed a boy who was much too young and feels that his actions will have severe repercussions. He shows his wife a hidden passage under Troy that she can take civilians through to get to the mountains should he die and the walls be breached. Though she is upset to have to consider the plan she heeds his advice.Achilles puts his cousin on a funeral pyre and sets it alight. Agamemnon watches and says ""That boy may have just saved the war for us"" knowing that the rage of Achilles will not wane until he's had revenge. Meanwhile Helen watches as Paris practices his archery in preparation for battle hitting his target with increasing accuracy.The following morning Achilles sets off to enact vengeance upon Hector. Briseis begs him not to go but he ignores her. He takes his chariot to the gates of Troy and calls for Hector who dresses in his armor and says goodbye to his wife. He meets Achilles outside alone. Achilles throws down his helmet so that Hector can see his face. Though Hector tries to reason Achilles is bent on bloodlust. As they begin to fight Priam and Paris watch while Helen comforts Andromache who can't bring herself to look. The two fight furiously breaking each other's spears. Hector trips on an embedded stone and is ordered by his opponent to stand and resume the fight. Achilles overpowers Hector by driving his spear into his chest before finishing him with his sword. He then ties Hector's legs together behind his chariot and drags him away back to the beach. When he returns to his hut Briseis cries out and asks when the killing will stop before leaving.That night Achilles is visited by a stranger in a cloak. The stranger kisses Achilles' hand before revealing himself as none other than King Priam. Having stealthily entered the Greek camp unnoticed Priam begs for the return of his son's body to be given a proper burial. He tells Achilles that while Hector killed his cousin he did not know who it was and he asks Achilles how many cousins and brothers he's killed in his time. Despite being enemies he asks for respect. Achilles relents. He weeps over Hector's body promising to meet him in the next life before giving him to Priam. When Briseis comes forward Achilles allows her to go home and apologizes for hurting her. He gives Priam his word that the Greeks will not attack Troy for 12 days to allot for proper mourning.When Agamemnon hears of Achilles' secret treaty with Priam he becomes incensed. But Odysseus who notices the sculpture of a horse a fellow soldier has made for his son proposes a plan putting the 12 days of mourning to their advantage.After 12 days the Trojans discover that the beach has been abandoned and various bodies lie in the sand. They appear to have been taken by disease and where the heart of the camp once was a large wooden horse has been erected. Priam is advised that the horse was left as a gift to the god Poseidon and is encouraged to bring it back to Troy. Paris who is suspicious urges his father to burn the horse but Priam brings the horse into the city where its revered as a sign of the end of the war. A Trojan scout hiking through the cliffs outside the city comes upon a cove apart from the main beach and discovers the Greek armada hiding there. However he is killed by arrow before he can warn the rest of Troy.Meanwhile the whole city celebrates into the night. Once everything has quieted down the horse opens and Achilles Odysseus and a small detachment of Greek soldiers emerge and slay several guards and open Troy's gates. The Greek army quickly pours into the city pillaging and burning homes and killing any Trojan who stands in their way while a tearful Priam can only watch. Soldiers of Troy attempt to defend the royal palace but fail. As Priam prays before the statue of Apollo and asks why he's been forsaken Agamemnon comes up behind him and stabs him in the back. Achilles meanwhile searches the city for Briseis.Paris and Andromache lead surviving civilians down to the secret passage where Paris gives a young boy Aeneas (Frankie Fitzgerald) (a progenitor of the Romans) the Sword of Troy reciting what his father told him. He then returns with his bow and arrow to help fight.Briseis is praying before a statue of Apollo when she is grabbed from behind by Agamemnon. Achilles finds them and rushes to her rescue. Agamemnon tells Briseis his intent to take her back to Greece as his slave before she takes a concealed knife and fatally stabs him in the neck. His guards accost her but Achilles kills them. As he is helping her up Paris arrives and shoots an arrow through Achilles' left heel. Standing up to face Paris despite Briseis' cries Achilles is shot again through the chest. He removes the arrow only to be shot several more times. He finally collapses and tells Briseis that she was his peace in a lifetime of war and urges her to escape. Briseis goes with Paris and they leave as the Greeks arrive at the palace to find Achilles dead seemingly taken by a single shot to the heel (thus perpetuating the myth surrounding his death).Achilles' body is burned honorably on a funeral pyre within the ruins of Troy the following day as Odysseus watches and exalts ""If they ever tell my story let them say I walked with giants. Men rise and fall like the winter wheat but these names will never die. Let them say I lived in the time of Hector tamer of horses. Let them say I lived in the time of Achilles."""

Erika Kohut (Isabelle Huppert) is a piano professor at a Vienna music conservatory. Although already in her forties she still lives in an apartment with her domineering mother (Annie Girardot); her father is a long-standing resident in a lunatic asylum. Throughout the film the audience is gradually shown truths about Erika's private life. Behind her assured façade she is a woman whose sexual repression verges into full-fledged desperation and is manifested in a long list of paraphilias including (but by no means limited to) voyeurism and sadomasochistic fetishes such as sexual self-mutilation.Upon meeting Walter Klemmer (Benoît Magimel) a charming 17-year-old engineering student from a bourgeois background they begin to obsess one another. Even though she initially attempts to prevent consistent contact and even tries to undermine his application to the conservatory he eventually becomes her pupil. Like her he appreciates and is a gifted (if distinct) interpreter of Schumann and Schubert.She destroys the musical prospects of an insecure but talented girl Anna Schober driven by her jealousy of the girl's contact with Walter -- and also perhaps by her fears that Anna's life will mirror her own. She does so by hiding shards of glass inside one of her coat pockets permanently damaging Anna's hands and ruining her aspirations to play at the forthcoming jubilee concert. Erika is then wholly sympathetic when the girl's mother (Susanne Lothar) asks for advice on her daughter's recuperation. (The sub-plot of the pupil and her mother mirroring the main relationship in the film is absent in Jelinek's novel.) In what clearly qualifies at that point of the film as dramatic irony the girl's mother rhetorically asks Erika who could do something so evil.Walter is increasingly insistent in his desire to start a relationship with her. But when she finally acquiesces Walter is unwilling to indulge her violent fantasies which repulse him. The film climaxes however when he finally does. He attacks her in her apartment in the fashion she let him know she desired violently raping her as she lies prostrate after receiving a beating from him. She discovers finally that the reality of her desires does not match her conception of them.Shortly thereafter minutes before the concert in which she is supposed to fill in for Anna Erika tries to enact some speculable form of revenge or call of attention on Walter and when confronted with his hypocritical smug indifference she puts a knife into herself and promptly leaves the auditorium. Her onscreen injury is not severe but the implications of the whole ending scene leave it clear to the audience that more serious self-inflicted harm is a matter of course.

Erika Kohut is a pianist teaching music. Schubert and Schumann are her forte but she's not quite at concert level. She's approaching middle age living with her mother who is domineering then submissive; Erika is a victim then combative. With her students she is severe. She visits a sex shop to watch DVDs; she walks a drive-in theater to stare at couples having sex. Walter is a self-assured student with some musical talent; he auditions for her class and is forthright in his attraction to her. She responds coldly then demands he let her lead. Next she changes the game with a letter inviting him into her fantasies. How will he respond; how does sex have power over our other faculties?::<jhailey@hotmail.com>

Eastern Europe 1904. A Jewish woman Yentl has a thirst for knowledge but is prohibited from learning due to the restrictions of her religion. When her father dies she sets off to increase her knowledge posing as a man in order to gain admission to a Jewish religious school.::grantss
1904. Teenaged Yentl lives in an Eastern European village with her widowed father Reb Mendel. Rather than become a devoted wife to whoever her husband to be - her obligation under Jewish custom - Yentl would like to study the Talmud a right reserved solely for men. She has no intention ever to be that subservient wife to any man. Her understanding father does oblige her wish to study the Talmud under his tutelage but with the stipulation that it be done in secret so as not to raise the ire of the community in general. But when Reb Mendel passes away Yentl having had a taste of that knowledge decides to leave her hometown so that she can don a disguise as a man - she calling herself Anschel - to continue her study of the Talmud. She is initially able to do so meeting and infiltrating a group of scholarly young men who are studying the Talmud under the direction of Reb Alter Vishkower. Beyond needing to avoid situations where her true identity as a female would be discovered Yentl finds her life unexpectedly more complicated when she falls in love with one of her colleagues Avigdor who in turn is already engaged to that devoted woman Hadass. Through her friendship with Avigdor and by association Hadass Yentl begins to understand something that she has been taught under the Talmud that the Talmud is not an end unto itself but rather a means to another end namely life as Yentl can see the love that exists between Avigdor and Hadass and like Hadass would do anything for Avigdor even what may seem the impossible such as a request Avigdor asks of his male friend Anschel .::Huggo
"In an Ashkenazic shtetl in Poland Yentl Mendel is the boyishly klutzy daughter and only child of long widowed Rebbe (""Talmud Teacher"") Mendel who teaches Talmud (a codification of Jewish Law) to local boys - and to Yentl but secretly because girls were not allowed to learn the law in those days. When her father dies Yentl is all alone in the world. She takes the momentous decision to leave the village and - disguised as a boy and calling herself by the name of her late brother Anshel - seeks and gets admitted to a Yeshiva to study the texts traditions subtleties and complexities of Torah Talmud etc. She befriends Avigdor who is engaged to Haddas but her family discovers his brother committed suicide so they call off the wedding (in case Avigdor possesses the same madness). Anshel then finds ""him""-self in the awkward position of being called into service as substitute bridegroom so that the wedding can go ahead and Haddas will have a husband. It is a marriage that never gets consummated - apart from the more obvious reasons because Haddas still wants Avigdor (though she eventually falls in love with Yentl too). After numerous complications (including Avidor and Yentl falling in love with each other briefly after she reveals her secret to him along with her bosom) the film ends with everybody getting what they always wanted - Haddas and Avigdor to live happily ever after with each other while Anshel now Yentl once again goes off to America to pursue her dream of serious study in Yeshiva where she will be able to study without needing to hide her identity as a woman.::Micheal McLoughlin"

As they are walking into the house Edith spots an unknown Van Gogh painting of John's with the note ""To my friend Jacques Borne"" on the back written in French. Once inside his friends persistently ask John why he is leaving.Another friend Art Jenkins (William Katt) an archeologist and his student Linda Murphy (Alexis Thorpe) arrive and John's friends continue to pressure him for the reason for his departure. John poses the question ""What if a man from the Upper Paleolithic survived until the present day?"" They assume that John is working on a science fiction story and play along with the discussion. As the film progresses John slowly reveals that he is the ""caveman"" under discussion when he mentions that he was given a chance to sail with Christopher Columbus in the 15th century. The revelation starts off with John's recollection of the terrain of prehistoric Earth and John's origins which happens to be roughly 14000 years ago. John reveals that he was once Jacques Borne a friend of Van Gogh's and he is now ""moving on"" since some people have noticed his lack of aging.As they take a break from the discussion Art who is concerned about John's sanity telephones another friend Dr. Will Gruber (Richard Riehle) an elderly psychologist explaining the odd situation and asks him to come over right away. In the meantime Sandy confesses to John that she loves him but John tells her they can never be together because of his immortality. John resumes his story by stating that he was once a Sumerian for 2000 years then a Babylonian under Hammurabi and finally a disciple of Gautama Buddha. Dr. Gruber arrives at which point Dan mentions that John's tale is as impossible to be disproved as it is to be verified a response to the many attempts to poke holes in John's story by his colleagues. The discussion takes a turn into the biological and physical condition of John and the topic of death. Gruber propels the discussion deeper into the topic of death and tension rises as Gruber interrogates John on that subject. The tension culminates with Gruber pointing a gun at John. After the drama ends with the departure of Gruber Harry reveals that Gruber's wife has passed away the day before and the profession of John's immortality had hit Gruber very hard.

John's audience is shocked when he reveals how he survived the crucifixion when he was Jesus by ""blocking the pain"" a technique he learned in India. He explains the origin of the Resurrection Moses and other events and people in the Bible. Tempers and emotions rise as Edith pressures John to recant his story which offends her deep-rooted faith in the Bible. Dr. Gruber returns to the scene and apologizes to John for his ""infantile behavior"". As John continues to pack his belongings onto the truck his colleagues begin to talk about the possibility of John being mentally ill or high on drugs.The discussions of John being Jesus Christianity and the Bible continue and Edith unable to take John's tale anymore breaks down crying. Emotions in the room run high. Gruber takes charge of the situation and sternly demands that John end his ""high tale"" and give closure to the story; he threatens John with the possibility of locking him up for observation. John apologizes to everyone and as he doesn't want to further upset any of his friends he tells them that all he just told them is just a story.As each of John's friends leave John apologizes to Harry and Edith while Art and Linda leave without many parting words. When it is Dan's turn to say goodbye it is hinted that Dan believes John's story.

"United States energy giant Connex is losing control of key Middle East oil fields in a kingdom ruled by the al-Subaai family. The emirate's foreign minister Prince Nasir (Alexander Siddig) has granted natural gas drilling rights to a Chinese company greatly upsetting the US oil industry and government. To compensate for its decreased production capacity Connex initiates a shady merger with Killen a smaller oil company that recently won the drilling rights to key petroleum fields in Kazakhstan. In the film Connex-Killen is loosely based on ExxonMobil and their deal for the Tengiz oil field in 2003. Connex-Killen ranks as the world's twenty-third largest corporation and US antitrust regulators at the Department of Justice (DOJ) have misgivings. A Washington law firm headed by Dean Whiting (Christopher Plummer) is hired to smooth the way for the merger. Bennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright) is assigned to promote the impression of due diligence to the DOJ deflecting any allegations of corruption.Emir storylineBryan Woodman (Matt Damon) is an energy analyst based in Geneva Switzerland. Woodman's supervisor directs him to attend a private party hosted by the emir at his estate in Marbella Spain to offer his company's services. The Emir's illness during the party prevents Woodman from speaking directly with the Emir while at the same time the emir's younger son Prince Meshal Al-Subaai (Akbar Kurtha) shows the estate's many rooms and areas to Chinese oil executives via remote controlled cameras. No one notices that a crack in one of the swimming pool area's underwater lights has electrified the water. Just as Woodman and all the other guests are brought to the pool area Woodman's son jumps into the pool and is fatally electrocuted.In reparation and out of sympathy for the loss of his son Prince Nasir grants Woodman's company oil interests worth US$100 million and Woodman gradually becomes his economic advisor. Prince Nasir (Alexander Siddig) is dedicated to the idea of progressive reform and understands that oil dependency is not sustainable in the long term; Nasir desires to utilize his nation's oil profits to diversify the economy and introduce democratic reforms in sharp contrast to his father's repressive government which has been supported by American interests. Woodman and his wife drift apart as he becomes more involved in working with the Prince and she even questions whether he is trading on the tragedy that took their son's life. Nasir hopes to succeed his father as emir but his younger brother is willing to continue the status quo and is chosen as the King's successor instead even though he's clearly unqualified to run a nation. Nasir plans a military coup but American intelligence plans to assassinate him via a remote missile attack on his convoy.Assassination storylineBob Barnes (George Clooney) is a veteran CIA Operations Officer trying to stop Middle Eastern illegal arms trafficking. While on assignment in Tehran to kill two Iranian arms dealers Barnes notices that one of two anti-tank missiles (actually FIM-92 Stingers) intended to participate in an explosion was diverted to an Egyptian (Amr Waked) while the other explodes and kills two Iranian agents. Barnes makes his superiors nervous by writing memos about the missile theft and is subsequently reassigned to a desk job. However unaccustomed to the political discretion required he quickly embarrasses the wrong people by speaking his mind and is sent back to the field with the assignment of assassinating Prince Nasir whom the CIA identifies as being the financier behind the Egyptians obtaining the missile. Prior to his reassignment Barnes confides with in his ex-CIA agent friend Stan Goff (William Hurt) that he will return to Lebanon. Goff advises him to clear his presence with Hezbollah so they know he is not acting against them. Barnes travels to Lebanon obtains safe passage from a Hezbollah leader and hires a mercenary named Mussawi (Mark Strong) to help kidnap and murder Nasir. But Mussawi has now become an Iranian agent and has Barnes kidnapped instead and then tortures him. The Hezbollah leader ultimately arrives at the scene of Barnes's torture in time to stop Mussawi from beheading Barnes.When the CIA learns that Mussawi plans to broadcast the agency's intention to kill Nasir they try to distance themselves by scapegoating Barnes portraying him as a rogue agent. Whiting worries first about Barnes talking about the Nasir assassination plan second about the possibility that Nasir's coup might have a greater likelihood of success and third that killing Nasir with a Predator drone missile would make it obvious that it is an American-backed assassination. He plots to make Barnes the scapegoat. He has his passports revoked locks him out of his computer at work and has him investigated. Barnes however learns from Stan Goff that Whiting is responsible and threatens him and his family unless he halts the investigation and releases Barnes's passports.Barnes eventually learns why he was portrayed as a rogue agent. He drives across the desert intent on warning Nasir. He stops Prince Nasir's convoy to warn him of the assassination plan. Before he can tell the Prince the Predator missile strikes the automobile of Nasir and his family killing them. Barnes stumbles away wounded. Woodman who gave his seat in Nasir's car to Nasir's wife survives the blast and goes home to his wife and son.Wasim StorylinePakistani migrant workers Saleem Ahmed Khan (Shahid Ahmed) and his son Wasim (Mazhar Munir) board a bus to go to work at a Connex refinery only to discover that they have been laid off due to a Chinese company outbidding Connex for the rights to run that facility. Since the company has provided food and lodging the workers face the threat of poverty and deportation due to their unemployed status. Wasim desperately searches for work but is refused because he doesn't speak Arabic. Wasim and his friend join an Islamic school to learn Arabic to improve their employment prospects. While playing soccer they meet a charismatic Islamic fundamentalist cleric (Amr Waked) (the very same Egyptian man who earlier stole Robert Barnes's anti-tank missile) who eventually leads them to execute a suicide attack on a Connex-Killen LNG tanker using a shaped-charge explosive from the missing Tehran missile.Merger storylineBennett Holiday meets with U.S. Attorney Donald Farish III (David Clennon) who is convinced that Killen bribed someone to get the drilling rights in Kazakhstan. While investigating Connex-Killen's records Holiday discovers a wire transfer of funds that leads back to a transaction between Texas oilman Danny Dalton (Tim Blake Nelson) and Kazakh officials. Holiday tells Connex-Killen of his discovery and they pretend not to have known about it. Holiday advises Dalton who makes a stirring defense of how corruption is simply the way of competition and how America ""wins"" against the rest of the corrupt world that he will likely be charged with corruption to serve as a ""body"" to get the DOJ off the back of the rest of Connex-Killen. Farish then strong-arms Holiday into giving the DOJ information about illegal activities he has discovered. Holiday gives up Dalton but Farish says this is not enough. Holiday meets with ex-Killen chief Jimmy Pope (Chris Cooper) and informs him that the DOJ needs a second body to drop the investigation. Pope asks Holiday whether a person at Holiday's firm above him would be sufficient as the additional body. Holiday acknowledges that if the name were big enough the DOJ would stop the investigation and allow the merger.Holiday is brought by his colleague and mentor Sydney Hewitt (Nicky Henson) to meet with the CEO of Connex-Killen Leland ""Lee"" Janus (Peter Gerety). In a surprise move Holiday reveals an under-the-table deal that Hewitt made while the Connex-Killen merger was being processed. Holiday has given Hewitt to the DOJ as the second body thereby protecting the rest of Connex-Killen. Janus is able to attend the ceremony ""oil industry man of the year"" with a load taken off his shoulders. Throughout the film Holiday has angrily crossed paths with his alcoholic father Bennett Sr.; at the movie's end when the merger has been completed Bennett Jr. lets his apologetic-looking dad enter his house and shuts the door."
A politically charged epic about the state of the oil industry in the hands of those personally involved in and affected by it.::mystic80
American oil companies Connex and smaller Killen are undergoing a merger the new company named Connex-Killen. The move is in response to Connex losing a number of oil fields in the Persian Gulf region as Prince Nasir Al-Subaai his country's foreign minister and the oldest son of the Emir and thus the heir apparent to the throne signed a contract with the Chinese instead. As Killen somehow managed to get the contract for the oil fields in Kazahkstan the merger would give Connex-Killen additional control of the industry in the Middle East. Connex's retained law firm headed by Dean Whiting assigns Bennett Holiday to demonstrate to the US Department of Justice that due diligence has been done to allow the merger to proceed i.e. that the merger would not break any antitrust regulations. The US government is unhappy with Prince Nasir's decision to award the contract to the Chinese and in combination with issues around illegal weapons the CIA assigns field agent Bob Barnes who has experience in the Middle East to assassinate the Prince whose eventual leadership would further undermine US oil security. Barnes becomes a pawn in the goings-on between the players. Meanwhile Geneva based Bryan Woodman an energy analyst eventually becomes associated with the Emir and his family largely due to a tragic incident. In the process Woodman learns of Prince Nasir's western leanings and his want to change radically his country into a western democracy with a diversified economy. If the Emir found out it could threaten Prince Nasir ascension to the throne and thus derail the democratization process. Through all these manoeuvrings migrant workers are affected some who cannot retain work with the changing of companies controlling the oil. Some of those may try to take matters into their own hands for their form of justice.::Huggo

"Approximately 2500 years ago the Athenian tragedians -- Sophocles Aeschylus Euripides -- said it all in the most eloquent and poetic terms. Everyone else has followed in their footsteps from Goethe and Shakespeare to Mann and Beckett. More than ever the ancient tragedies are relevant today for their subject matter is the universal nature of man: his hunger for power his greed and his lust. The plays are the confirmation of the human tragedy for all times and all places. The Greek myths upon which these tragedies are based combine marvelous storytelling with symbolic associations that are the foundations of the collective unconscious of our modern world.Euripides left behind some of the most astonishing expressions of human passion and compassion ever set into dramatic form. His plays express a range of delight hope and terror unmatched in classical drama. Of these certainly none display more range than the inexorable bloodletting of the stories of the House of Atreus and the Trojan War which Euripides treats with characteristic balance in several of his tragedies.For the cinema Greek myths and ancient tragedies are made-to-order screenplays. Many film directors have tried to take advantage of this gold mine with varying degrees of success. For some they have proven to be very expensive failures as exemplified recently by a prominent Hollywood director Wolfgang Petersen. Other directors reworking particular tragedies have produced freshly reincarnated masterpieces. Such is ""Iphigenia"" (1977) by Greek director Mikhali (Michael) Cacoyannis based on Euripedes' tragedy ""Iphigenia in Aulis.""""Iphigenia"" relates the story of an incident that took place just prior to the Trojan War. Helen wife of Menelaus king of Sparta had eloped to Troy with Paris son of King Priam. Menelaus' brother Agamemnon King of Argos had assembled a huge Greek expeditionary force on the shores of Aulis that he planned to lead to Troy in order to reclaim his brother's wife. The Goddess Artemis taking revenge for an insult done to her by Agamemnon's father King Atreus created a meteorological problem by sending storms or calms to prevent the Greek fleet from sailing to Troy. This is where the film begins.The Greek armies have waited for what seems an eternity for the winds to rise blow eastward and carry their boats to Troy. The men are tired bored hungry and anxious to go into battle. In a public relations gesture intended to placate the men Agamemnon (Costa Kazakos) directs them to go and help themselves to a flock of sheep that belong to the nearby temple dedicated to Artemis. In the ensuing mayhem Artemis' sacred deer is accidentally slain. Calchas (Dimitris Aronis) high priest of Artemis' temple is incensed by the sacrilege. He delivers an oracle to Agamemnon with Menelaus (Kostas Karras) and Odysseus (Christos Tsagas) also present. The oracle according to Calchas emanating from Artemis herself demands that Agamemnon offers a sacrifice to atone for the defiling of the holy ground and the killing of the sacred stag. Once the sacrifice is made Artemis will consent for the armies to sail to Troy by allowing the winds to blow eastward. The sacrifice is to be Agamemnon's first-born daughter Iphigenia (Tatiana Papamoschou). The news of ""the deal"" soon spreads through the armies' ranks although the nature of the sacrifice remains temporarily unknown to them.After considerable argument and recrimination between the two brothers Agamemnon sends a message to his wife Clytemnestra (Irene Papas) in Argos. In his letter Agamemnon is asking his wife to send their daughter Iphigenia to Aulis ostensibly to wed Achilles (Panos Mihalopoulos). Achilles leader of the Mymirdon army is a member of Agamemnon's expeditionary forces. Against her husband's instructions Clytemnestra decides to accompany her daughter to Aulis.From this point forward to the climax the tempo and the development of the tragedy stretches tighter. Agamemnon has second thoughts about his plan. After confessing his ruse to his old servant (Angelos Yannoulis) Agamemnon dispatches him with another letter to Clytemnestra that reveals the truth and tells her to cancel Iphigenia's trip. The old man is intercepted on the road by Menelaus' men and returned to Aulis. In the ensuing confrontation Menelaus rebukes his brother for betraying the honor of Greece for his personal benefit. Agamemnon argues persuasively and convinces Menelaus that no war is worth the life of a child. Following their understanding Agamemnon decides to personally carry the letter to Clytemnestra. Too late. A messenger announces the imminent arrival of the wedding party which includes Clytemnestra. Agamemnon is stunned by the announcement and he resigns himself to the worst: ""From now on fate rules. Not I.""Clytemnestra arrives at Aulis filled with happiness over her daughter's prospective wedding the famous Myrmidon leader Achilles. Iphigenia's first meeting with her father is couched in double entendre which is devastating: as she talks about her upcoming wedding he talks about her upcoming sacrifice. They use the same words but the meanings could not be more horribly apart. When Agamemnon meets with Clytemnestra he still vainly tries to convince her to return to Argos without witnessing the ""wedding."" Clytemnestra and Achilles soon learn the truth from Agamemnon's old servant. Achilles is overcome with shame and rage when he learns of the deceit that has involved him in this tragedy. Clytemnestra rises into a fury and in desperation confronts her husband one last time. Agamemnon however is trapped in his own web and cannot now back down as Odysseus has threatened to inform the army of the exact nature of the sacrifice if Agamemnon does not follow through on the oracle's demand.Meanwhile preparations for the sacrifice are proceeding. ""Let's not delay the wind is rising"" says Calchas. Odysseus finally forces the situation when he tells the army who is to be the sacrificial victim. Now there is no turning back. Iphigenia briefly escapes but she is soon recaptured by Odysseus' soldiers. In a poignant scene suggestive of the scene of the slowly dying sacred stag at the beginning of the film Iphigenia is caught lying down panting and out of breath ""dying"" on the forest floor. Her captors return her to the camp to face her executioners. Now resigned to her fate she has a last heartrending meeting with her father before walking up the hill toward her final destiny. While Agamemnon surrounded by his cheering army watches helplessly on the steps below Iphigenia reaches the top and is quickly grabbed by Calchas. At that same moment upon seeing the wind rising. Agamemnon runs up the steps and as he reaches the top of hill his face reflects what we assume is the sight of the dead Iphigenia. However Cacoyannis chooses to leave the ending somewhat ambiguous: is Iphigenia supernaturally whisked away as in Euripides' play or is she sacrificed in agreement with the tradition? Not having Agamemnon's eyes we'll never know for sure.A strong wind now blows. The men run to the beach push their ships into the sea and sail toward Troy and its promised treasures.

While the Muslims under Jinnah wanted a separate country which they would like to call Pakistan the Hindus wanted the Muslims to leave this country and go to Pakistan. Clashes followed millions fled millions more were killed Very little is known of mankind's heinous behavior in this circumstances such as looting raping and kidnapping. puro was one such woman who was recently married to Ramchand and then abducted by a man named Rashid who gets her to Pakistan where she is to be second wife of an abusive and controlling male.

However the film is more about the sexual mores of the day than about the wartime effort. It seems each of the coders has a secret.

The contract states that in return for love and gold Scapanelli may take any one item from Balduins home. To help Balduin make up his mind Scapanelli pulls out a never-ending bag of gold. The gold flows at an alarming rate out of Scapinellis sleeve which much to the amazement of Balduin helps to seal the deal. Agreeing to the seemingly beneficial terms Balduin signs the contract. Scapinelli immediately goes for what he wants. He walks over to the mirror tat is hanging on the wall touches up and down the side of the mirror stunning Balduin as Scapanelli removes his reflection from the mirror essentially taking Balduins soul. Despite fearing he has made a big mistake Balduin makes the best of his newfound wealth. He goes to the local club drinks dances and is courted by women all around him. Balduin is soon called on by the count (Lothar Korner) to have him come to the counts abode. Balduin has a conversation with the countess when he arrives unknowing that he is being watched by the a wandering girl. As they are talking the wandering girl has climbed up to the balcony and watches them from behind the pillars and banisters so she can stay hidden. After they both leave the wandering girl grabs a piece of evidence that Balduin has carelessly left behind. Balduin soon finds himself falling for the countess and attempts to arrange another meeting with her. Balduin is soon faced with the reality of his agreement with Scapinelli when his double which looks just like he does stalks him and interferes with his attempts to impress the countess. As he and the countess forced to meet in private are meeting again a graveyard Balduins double make his presence known. Seeing a double of Balduin frightens the countess and she runs away. Haunted by his own reflection Balduin struggles to lead a normal life. The wandering girl soon brings to the attention of the counts uncle Baron Waldis-Schwarzenbrg (Fritz Weidemann) that the countess and Balduin have been meeting in private. She brings the note that she found after Balduin and the countess had met on the balcony and shows him. Angered by this the count challenges Balduin to a duel. Hearing the rumors of how good Balduin is at sword fighting he is asked by the Baron to please not kill the count. Balduin agrees not to kill him but his double does not. The next morning on his way to the duel he comes in contact with his double again. Noticing the swagger behind the doubles appearance and the cleaning of his sword Balduin soon realizes that his double killed the count. Completely mortified by this Balduin runs away and buries himself in bottles of alcohol and his money at the same club he was at before. This time instead of him celebrating his new life he is watching as the wandering girl and everyone else around him enjoys their night. Realizing he isnt going to get the countess being depressed in the club Balduin heads to her house. He gets to the outer gate of her house because there is no way to get through the gate Balduin is forced to climb over the fence. When he finally makes it over Balduin is faced with another obstacle; the countess room is not on ground level. Finding a ladder nearby Balduin scales the wall. He makes it to her balcony and sees her in her room. His plan works and the countess kisses him passionately until the double reappears through the window. Balduin finally loses it and runs all over town outside of the countess house up the road finally to his new home. When he gets into his house he frantically searches for something finally coming across a gun in one of his drawers. In a desperate attempt to rid himself of this nightmare he pulls the gun out and shoots his reflection. Rejoicing in this victory doesnt last long as Balduin soon realizes he has shot himself. Scapinelli enters and finds Balduin laying dead on the ground. He then begins to dance around and celebrate his conquest over Balduin. He grabs the contract that Balduin had signed earlier rips it up and throws it into the air smirks and continues his celebration out the door.
"Balduin a student of Prague leaves his roystering companions in the beer garden when he finds he has reached the end of his resources. He is scarcely seated in a quiet corner when a hideous shriveled-up old man taps him upon the shoulder and whispers vaguely of a big inheritance for Prague's finest swordsman and wildest student if he will enter into a certain agreement. Balduin rebuffs him satirically asking his weird companion to procure him ""the luckiest ticket in a lottery or a doweried wife."" The old man goes off chuckling and thence onward persistently shadows Balduin exerting a sinister influence over him while Balduin is still disconsolate under the frowns of fortune. The Countess Margit Schwarzenberg hunting with her cousin to whom her father has betrothed her meets with an accident. She is thrown over her horse's head into a river but Balduin who has been directed to the spot by his evil genius plunges in and rescues her. Subsequently Balduin calls to inquire as to her condition at the castle of her father the count but be makes a hurried departure when Baron Waldis arrives the contrast in their appearance discrediting him. His desire to win the countess and to humiliate the baron becomes so pronounced that he readily accedes to the compact suggested by Scapinelli the old man who has so pertinaciously dogged his footsteps particularly when he learns that untold wealth and power will be his when he assigns to the other the right to take from his room whatever he chooses for his own use as he desires. The agreement is signed. Balduin receives a shower of gold and notes as his portion; Scapinelli takes Balduin's soul exposed in concrete form by his shadow. Balduin prosecutes his love affair assiduously and with apparent success till the baron is informed of it by a jealous gypsy girl. He challenges Balduin to a duel and the latter assured of his superiority as a fencer readily agrees. Count Schwarzenberg learns of the impending duel and appeals to Balduin not to kill ""my sister's child my daughter's future husband and my heir."" Balduin gives his promise but when he goes to the venue of the duel he meets his own counterpart stalking away derisively wiping his gory sword on his cloak. Balduin turns and in the far distance sees the dying victim of the deed he swore he would not do. He rushes from the spot horror-stricken. When he regains sufficient composure he makes his way to the castle of the count but is refused admission. Determined to explain that he had no complicity in the death of the baron Balduin climbs into a room in which the countess is seated. She receives him coldly but soon succumbs to his ardent wooing. Just as he seeks to leave her she notices he has no shadow and that the mirror gives no reflection of him; and she drops back affrighted the ghastly apparition of himself which takes shape in the corner of the room sends Balduin scuttling away from the castle in a paroxysm of terror. He makes a frenzied flight through a woodland estate and the streets of Prague but wherever he stops to recover his breath he is haunted by the counterpart of himself. He reaches his rooms and draws a murderous looking fire-arm from its case. As the phantasmagorical figure strides towards him with a sinister grin he fires and in a few minutes the blood gushes from his own side from a fatal wound.::Moving Picture World synopsis"

Il film narra di una piccola emittente privata di Correggio in Emilia nata col nome di Radio Raptus ma che ha cambiato nome in onore di Ivan detto Freccia per la forma di una voglia che ha sulla tempia. Sulle note della grande musica rock degli anni '70/80 la storia è raccontata a ritroso partendo dal 1993 quando la radio sta per chiudere per sempre le trasmissioni e lo fa simbolicamente un minuto prima di compiere i diciotto anni. La narrazione si snoda fra il bar di Adolfo la stazione radio (usata spesso come luogo di ritrovo e di riposo) e le piazze del paese. Del gruppo di giovani fa parte anche Freccia di cui lo speaker radiofonico racconta la storia che si intreccia con quella della radio e delle speranze dei giovani degli anni '70. Freccia è leale ed onesto anche se all'apparenza indifferente ; sicuro di sé al punto di avvicinarsi all'eroina (flagello che allora si stava infiltrando nella maglie della gioventù) convinto di potervi rinunciare in qualsiasi momento ma debole al punto di ricadervi per una delusione amorosa. E proprio in una di queste fasi di ritorno alla droga un'ultima overdose gli sarà fatale. La radio sta per chiudere. Ma...è proprio certo che tutto è andato perduto per quei giovani?::rosebud6
