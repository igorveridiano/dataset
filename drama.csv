"""The Dresser"" opens with a performance of ""Othello"" at a regional theater in England during the last days of World War Two. In the title role is an ageing, once-famous Shakespearean actor identified to us only as ""Sir"" (Albert Finney). He is of the old. bombastic school of British acting, full of grand gestures and fine oratory. As the curtain comes down on the last act, and as the actors line up for their curtain call, Sir lectures them on the mistakes they've made during the performance, showing us that he is the leader of this traveling band of actors bringing Shakespeare to the provinces during wartime.Waiting backstage is Norman (Tom Courtenay), who has been Sir's dresser for decades. Norman is an efficient, somewhat effeminate little man who knows Sir's every whim and fancy, is used to his tirades and temperamental rants and is, for all intents and purposes, Sir's servant. As Norman waits for Sir to come offstage after a typically florid closing address to the audience, we see one way he copes with his job as he takes a nip from a handy little bottle of brandy always in his back pocket.Next we see the company hurrying to its next venue, a theater in the industrial town of Bradford where Sir is to give his renowned portrayal of King Lear. The train nearly leaves without them, as Sir makes his stately progress through the train station to the platform, Norman scurrying ahead to plead with the train guard the even the conductor to hold the train for Sir's arrival. But the train begins to pull out of the station, until Sir delivers a loud, commanding ""STOP....THAT....TRAIN!"" from the platform steps. The conductor, taken aback, does just that and Sir placidly leads his company aboard.Arriving in Bradford, however, we soon learn another source of Norman's anxiety, for it becomes obvious that Sir's mental capacities are rapidly fading. Norman rescues him from a confused, almost violent rant in the town square that lands Sir in the hospital. As the company tries to decide what to do, Sir unexpectedly arrives at the theater, disoriented and exhausted, saying he's checked himself out of the hospital. Norman ushers Sir theater's dressing room, fiercely resisting the stage manager's insistence that the show be canceled and insisting Sir will be ready to go on.The middle section of the film takes place nearly entirely in the dressing room, as Norman struggles to prepare Sir for the curtain. Sir's wandering mind and nearly incoherent ramblings gradually become more focused as Norman gets him to concentrate on applying his makeup, remembering his lines; and we see how dependent the two men are on each other. Sir would have no career left without Norman; Norman, even worse, would have no life without Sir, to whom he has so long dedicated all his time and energy. By the time Sir's wife, referred to only as ""Her Ladyship"" and who is playing Cordelia to her husband's Lear, arrives in the dressing room for the five-minute call, Sir is ready for the role we learn he has performed 227 times.The curtain rises for the opening dialogue among Lear's courtiers, but Sir seems to mentally drift away while waiting for his cue, much to Norman's distress, forcing the hapless actors on stage to improvise speeches while Norman struggles to convince Sir of his entrance. Air raid sirens sound, signaling the possibility of an airstrike; and, indeed, distant bombs that can be heard falling seem to rouse Sir and he strides on stage to deliver what all agree is his finest portrayal of Lear in his long career.After the triumphant performance, however, Sir collapses from exhaustion and Norman helps him to his dressing room to lie down. Sir requests Norman to read from an autobiography he claims to have been writing. Although all Sir has written is the opening dedication, Norman reads aloud Sir's gracious thank yous to his audiences, his fellow actors, to Shakespeare, to stage technicians...but not a word about his dresser who has served him so long and loyally. About to protest, Norman discovers that Sir has died while he's been reading. Norman, by now slightly drunk from the evening's brandy nips, flies into a rage, accusing Sir of being a thankless old sod, and in his anger even madly scribbles an addition to Sir's writing thanking himself. But Norman's anger only temporarily covers his disorientation at losing the only life he has known for so many years and, as Norman tearfully admits, the only man he has ever loved. The film closes with Norman sprawled across Sir's body, unwilling to let go of his life and his love."

"In a touring Shakespearean theater group, a backstage hand, the dresser, Norman (Sir Tom Courtenay), is devoted to the brilliant but tyrannical head of the company. He struggles to support deteriorating star Sir (Albert Finney) as the company struggles to carry on during the London blitz. The pathos of his backstage efforts rival the pathos in the story of Lear and the Fool that is being presented on-stage, as the situation comes to a crisis.::xenophil"
"It's the early 1940s Britain. Norman (Sir Tom Courtenay), a slight, timid man, has worked for sixteen years as the dresser for the lead actor in a Shakespearean theater troupe, his boss, who is referred to solely as Sir (Albert Finney). Beyond his official dressing duties, Norman, dedicated to Sir and his work, also unofficially acts as Sir's personal assistant/gopher, ego and morale booster, caregiver and confidante, all of these duties, despite Sir being married to the troupe's lead actress, he who ensures that Sir is ready to go on stage each night. Norman relieves the stress of his job by taking the frequent nip from a mickey always on his person, and always when he doesn't think anyone notices. The troupe is currently on a tour, performing a different Shakespearean play at each one night stop, but always with Sir in the lead, he who planned the schedule and plays to be performed. Sir dominates the troupe, wanting to place himself at the best light in comparison to the supporting players. Some of his fellow actors dislike Sir's attitude and behavior, especially Oxenby (Edward Fox), but they will all band together to ensure the best show is left on stage each night. Sir's ego has not diminished in relation to his declining abilities, he well past his prime. Those declining abilities are demonstrated at their latest stop in Bradford to perform King Lear, there where early in the day Sir suffers a nervous breakdown leading to him being checked into the local hospital. Sir checks himself out for the show to go on. Beyond the added fact of the troupe being down one cast or crew member since their last performance, Norman has an especially difficult task this evening in ensuring not only that Sir is ready by curtain time, but that he holds it together over the course of the performance. By the end of the evening, Norman will get a clearer picture of just where he stands in Sir's life.::Huggo"

"The film's prologue takes place in a field of flowers. Radha (Karishma Jhalani), a young girl, relaxes with her mother (Ramanjeet Kaur) and her father (Dilip Mehta). Radha's mother tells a story of a group of people living in mountains who'd never seen the sea. They were sad, and then an old woman told them that they had to see without looking. Radha's mother asks her if she understands. Radha says no.In the present, Sita (Nandita Das) stands with a bunch of visitors in front of a tour guide, looking at the Taj Mahal. The tour guide explains how Shah Jahan's wife made him promise to build this monument as a symbol of their love. Sita's husband Jatin (Javed Jaffrey) joins the group. He and Sita are in an arranged marriage and they don't get along. Sita asks Jatin, ""Don't you like me?"" He responds that they've only been married for three days.In her home, the now-adult Radha (Shabana Azmi) cares for her mother-in-law, Biji (Kushal Rekhi), who's suffered a stroke, cannot talk and barely moves around. Radha powders her back, clothes her, and gives her a bell, which she uses to communicate with. Radha lives here with Biji and her husband Ashok (Kulbhushan Kharbanda), and the family operates a restaurant downstairs with a video store next to it.Jatin and Sita arrive at the house. Jatin and Ashok are brothers. The family talks. Jatin leaves for an appointment. Radha takes Sita to her room, explaining that when Biji rings her bell, she needs something. In her room, Sita puts on a pair of jeans and dances to music. Radha opens Sita's door, taking her by surprise. The two women go into the main room where Biji is. Biji rings her bell, disturbed by the sight of Sita in the jeans. Sita goes back to her room to change clothes.Meanwhile, Jatin paints his Chinese girlfriend Julie's (Alice Poon) toenails. He tells her that he cannot live without her.Ashok sits with a group of followers of his religious leader/swami, Swamiji (Ram Gopal Bajaj), who talks to them. Ashok says one should test oneself against temptation until desire leaves the body.Ashok and Radha work at the restaurant with Sita helping. Mundu (Ranjit Chowdhry), the family's manservant, carries Biji, who likes watching them work, upstairs. Ashok tells Sita that when she has a baby, caring for it will become her full-time job. Sita wonders why this subject matter came up. Radha explains to her that she cannot have a baby.Upstairs, Mundu jerks off in front of the reposed Biji to a porno movie. Biji moans in disturbance. Mundu tells her to shut up. Sita comes in and Mundu manages to compose himself, not getting caught. Sita sees that Biji's disturbed. Mundu talks about the program he has on the TV, wherein the goddess Sita's purity is being tested.Jatin tells Ashok that he felt he had no choice in marrying Sita, due to Ashok's nagging. Jatin accuses Ashok of doing everything he does for Swamiji. Ashok hits Jatin. A few moments later, Ashok tells Radha to forgive him, saying to her, ""My choices have made life difficult for you."" Radha responds, ""What is there to forgive?""That night, Jatin and Sita have sex for the first time - a loveless, mechanical act. Jatin lies back and goes to sleep. Sita cleans her blood off of the bed's sheet.The next day or so, Jatin and Sita talk. He suggests that she find something to do. They argue. Sita tells him that he should not leave his picture of Julie laying around.The family is about to clean up downstairs. Ashok gives Radha and Jatin some money. Jatin asks how long Ashok will support Swamiji. Ashok says Swamiji doesn't ask for money; he gives to the swami willingly.That night, Ashok lies in a bed next to Radha, testing himself to see if he will be tempted by her sexually. She gets up and asks him if she could have children, would he need her? He says, probably not. Ashok tells Radha that by helping him with his tests, she's doing her duty as his wife.Sita and Radha meet on the roof of the building that Ashok's family lives in. Sita says Jatin has gone to meet his girlfriend. In the street below, a marriage ceremony takes place.Later, Radha finds Sita crying in her room. Sita says she wants to go home. Radha comforts Sita. Sita kisses her on the mouth and Radha leaves.In the field from the prologue, Radha's mom cries. She tells young Radha to look at the fields and what they've become. Radha says they look the same. Radha's mom says, ""Close your eyes."" Young Radha answers, ""I still can't see.""That night, Radha gets up and looks at the sleeping Ashok in his separate bed. Elsewhere, Jatin and Julie talk for awhile, then they kiss passionately.Radha and Sita have tea together and talk. Sita says that someone can push a button on her back marked tradition, and she will respond.Radha and Sita fast together. Radha tells a story of a king, a queen and a maidservant to Sita and Mundu that ends with the queen fasting in order to win back her husband's love. Radha explains that the women fast to prove how much they love their husbands. Sita says the queen was a wimp and the king was a jerk. Radha summarizes that the queen didn't have many choices.Radha and Sita finish the ceremony on the roof of the building they live in. Biji sleeps in her bed. A bit later, Sita gets up, goes to Radha's bedroom and wakes her up. Sita kisses Radha and the two make love. The next morning, Sita asks, ""Did we do anything wrong?"" Radha answers ""no."" Sita exits Radha's bedroom under Biji's watchful eye.The next day, Radha and Sita bestow jewelry upon each other while Mundu looks at them. Later, the two couples sit outside, having eaten some food. Sita massages Radha's foot while Ashok watches, thinking nothing of it.In the family's house, Jatin prepares to go out amid his relatives. Ashok tells him that he's not going. Sita tells Ashok to let him go. Radha asks Ashok if he's going to Swamiji's and he says after Biji finishes dinner, he will. Biji rings her bell at length, and Ashok assumes that she doesn't want him to leave.That night, before a crowd in public, some men act out a part of the Ramayana wherein Lord Ram tests the goddess Sita's purity by having her go into a fire. Ashok and Swamiji watch them.Radha and Sita kiss outside on the roof of the building. Ashok calls Radha and after awhile, she comes to him. He asks her, ""Why didn't you come?"" She says that Sita says the concept of duty is overrated. Ashok tells Radha to prepare for him to test himself with her, and she says not tonight.In their bedroom, Jatin starts to mount Sita, but she doesn't want to have sex, so he lays off.The next day, Radha and Sita dance together in front of Biji to jubilant Indian music. Biji looks on disapprovingly as the two women sink to the floor together. Mundu watches in the next room.Later in the video store, Jatin convinces some young boys to buy a porno movie from him. Mundu takes one of the porno movies upstairs to jerk off to, while Biji watches in horror. Radha walks in and catches him. She slaps him, asking him where he got the movie. He says that Jatin rents them to special customers. She tells him to get out, and he says that the ""hanky panky"" between her and Sita isn't good for the family name.Radha asks Ashok to get rid of Mundu, but Ashok insists that he stays. On the roof, she and Sita meet and talk. Sita says that even if Mundu mentions what he's seen, no one will believe him. Radha admits she is not so different from Mundu in his selfishness.Jatin recites some of Swamiji's words to Sita in their room. He tells her that he cannot stop seeing Julie, mentioning some of Julie's good traits. He says Sita can leave him, but that life can be difficult for a divorced woman. The other option, he says, is for Sita to have a baby with him. She calls him a ""pompous fool."" They slap each other. He says he likes her new feistiness and kisses her on the mouth. She looks at him with displeasure, so he knocks her down and leaves.On the roof, Radha sees a bruise on Sita's face and asks her if it hurts. Sita says she's treated ""like a household pet,"" and ""that's what hurts."" The women hug each other.In the restaurant later, Ashok carries Biji upstairs, leaving Radha with a singing Mundu. Radha's gaze is contemptuous. Jatin announces to everyone that he won't be back tonight and leaves. Mundu sits down and stares at a photo of Biji, Jatin, Radha and Sita, with everyone crossed out except for Radha, who has a heart drawn around her head.Alone together, Radha tells Sita that a long time ago, Ashok took a vow of celibacy. She explains what he does with her to prove he's beyond temptation and therefore closer to God. Radha tells her that he's done this for 13 years. Radha and Sita hug each other. Mundu listens at the door outside. Sita says they're not going to stay there any longer.Mundu pulls Ashok away from Swamiji, but then says nothing. Later, the two men go upstairs to the house. Ashok tells Mundu to pack his bags and get out of the house before he calls the police.Inside the house, Ashok listens at the door outside the room where Radha and Sita make love. He slams open the door, startling them and catching them in the act. He walks away, then exits the house.The women decide to leave, with Sita saying that there's no word in their language for what they are. Radha says she has to talk to Ashok one last time, to tell him that her leaving is about her. Radha tells Sita that she should leave and they will meet later tonight. Sita packs her belongings to leave. In the main room, Biji rings her bell as Sita leaves. Radha steps close to Biji, who sits up and spits in her face. Downstairs, Ashok freaks out, thinking about his wife in intimacy with Sita.Ashok goes to Radha in the kitchen and tells her to come to the bedroom, so that he can test himself again. She refuses, saying that she's going to leave him. Ashok says that what he saw in their bedroom is a sin in the eyes of God and man. She openly repudiates his thinking that desire is wrong. Ashok snaps, throwing himself upon her. She rejects his touch. He says, ""Touch my feet,"" then pushes her aside. Her sari catches fire on the stove.Ashok stares at Radha for a moment, then picks up Biji and goes to the door.Back at the field from the prologue, young Radha closes her eyes and then says she can see the ocean.At the agreed-upon meeting place, Sita stands in the rain. She sees Radha shuffle over to her, looking shaken. Radha leans against a wall for support. Sita goes over to her and comforts her."
"Two women who are abandoned by their husbands, find love and solace in each other.::IDream"
"Ashok runs a family business that sells takeout food that also has a video rental store at the side. Ashok's extended family includes his wife Radha, his brother Jatin, their ailing mother Biji and their manservant Mundu, all living under the same roof. Jatin, at the insistence of Ashok and their mother, Biji, agrees to marry the beautiful Sita in an arranged marriage, although he is actually in love with Julie, a Chinese-Indian. At first glance, you see a happy middle-class family going through the normal paces of everyday life. However, as the layers are slowly peeled back, we find a simmering cauldron of discontent within the family, with almost every family member living a lie. Both marriages in the family turn out to be emotionally empty, without love or passion. While Ashok is an ascetic who has taken a vow of celibacy, Jatin is a handsome ladies' man who is still openly seeing Julie even after his marriage to Sita. Ashok has pledged his total devotion to a religious holy man, a swami, in order to purge his life of worldly desires and temptations. Radha, bound by her sense of duty to her husband, agrees to go along with his wishes. As you can imagine, with both husbands ignoring their spouses' emotional and sexual needs (albeit with reasons that are totally opposite from each other), it is only a matter of time before Radha and Sita look to one another for comfort and to satisfy their own passions. In this environment, it is only natural that Sita and Radha become fast friends, and, in time, much more than that. But their love is not without its share of painful obstacles.::Hariharan"
"Aged Biji is a widow, who is unable to walk, talk and look after herself, communicates with a bell, lives with two sons, Ashok and his barren wife, Radha, and Jatin, who is in love with a Chinese-Indian, Julie, and a male servant, Mundu. When Julie refuses to marry him as she dislikes joint family life, he is more or less brow-beaten to marry Sita so that she bear a male child to carry on the family name. Ashok has given up on marriage and is now leading a celibate life, has become a follower of a religious leader, Swamiji, and spends all his free time with him. Jatin has not given up on Julie and continues to meet her in his free time. Thus Radha and Sita are left alone most of the time. While Ashok, Radha and Sita run a take-out Punjabi food business, Jatin runs a video store where he rents out porno movies also on the sly. Mundu passes his free time watching some of these porno movies and masturbating, much to Biji's dislike. Then one day Radha surprises Mundu and tells Ashok to fire him. But Mundu knows Radha's secret - a secret that if revealed, will tear the lives of the entire family apart.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"

"A twenty-something innocent-looking woman is taken by force to an interrogation by a single male who is seemingly a government investigator. Her children's book, CLOSET LAND, is accused to contain subversive messages from some unnamed underground working against the government. The rooster character in the book is posited as the leader of a terrorist cell, for example. She maintains her innocence as the irony mounts from the questioner's continued belief that she has given hidden signals to fellow insurgents inside what she says is a simple children's story. Her questioning gets more brutal as she is strapped to a torture table, given drugs, and otherwise molested. During her torture, she reverts to her childhood-learned ability to withdraw mentally to an imagined world of fictional animal characters which assist her to cope with --in her childhood-- being locked in a closet and --in her torture-- she uses the same technique to survive with her sanity and her consistent denial of guilt. The interrogator, who may or may not be the man who molested her when she was a child, appears to eventually believe in her innocence but her refusal to sign a confession will apparently result in a chemically-induced lobotomy.Direction, writing, and acting are all brilliant.

But he finds no peace there, for he soon develops a troubling attraction to an adolescent boy, Tadzio (Björn Andrésen), on vacation with his family. The boy embodies an ideal of beauty that Aschenbach has long sought and he becomes infatuated.

"It's the early twentieth century. Gustav von Aschenbach (Sir Dirk Bogarde), once married with a daughter, is a Munich-based composer of experimental music. Now a frail middle-aged man in ill health, he is advised by his doctor to get complete rest. As such, he is alone at the Grand Hotel, on the Lido in Venice, to convalesce. He and his friend Alfred (Mark Burns) have had many a philosophical discussion about the concept of beauty, not only as it applies to his oft not appreciated music, but as it applies to the arts and life in general. It is in Gustav's belief in how the nature of beauty can dominate one on a scientific as opposed to emotional level that he becomes obsessed with a Polish teenager named Tadzio (Björn Andrésen), who looks to be staying at the hotel with his sisters and their mother. Most of Gustav's interactions with Tadzio are furtive yet still intense gazes from afar. As time progresses, Gustav admits to himself that that obsession turns into love, with nary a word spoken between the two of them. On an emotional level, he is torn by his feelings, he at first trying to escape physically, then changing to doing anything to remain within view of Tadzio.

"The story opens with a rock musician and singer, Chris Cole, being interviewed. He recalls his early days in music, when he lived in Pittsburgh and was the lead singer of a band called Blood Pollution, a cover/tribute act that performed songs by an infamous heavy metal band called Steel Dragon. While a member of Blood Pollution, Chris was also a singer in a local church choir and had a pretty girlfriend, Emily Poule, who managed his band. Chris also worked as a photocopier technician.Chris and his compatriots go to a Steel Dragon concert. In the parking lot they paper every car in sight with flyers for their next gig. At the show, Chris and his friends have stage-side seats. They are refused backstage passes by the bands live manager, Mats. During the performance, Chris mildly annoys Dragon's lead singer, Bobby Beers, by singing along with the songs as well or better and louder than Beers himself.Following the show, Chris and his bandmates return to their car and find a flyer for their rivals, another Steel Dragon tribute band called Black Babylon. The members of Black Babylon have callously replaced Blood Pollution's flyers on every car. The two bands face off in the parking lot and fight after trading insults.At a Blood Pollution practice session (which they hold in the basement of a porn theatre), Chris and his guitarist, Rob Malcolm, argue over the manner with which they'll play a Steel Dragon song live. Chris obsesses over a specific guitar riff and Rob can't understand why.The band plays a gig in a steel foundry. The show goes well until Chris notices that Rob is once again defying the singer's wishes and reinterprets a guitar part. After an initial warning from Chris, Rob begins to solo wildly in defiance. Chris casually picks up a microphone stand and smashes Rob's amplifier head, disabling it. Rob tackles Chris onstage and the two fight. Emily, at the soundboard, calls it a night and encourages the audience to buy the band's merchandise on the way out.A few nights later Chris shows up for band practice and sees that his fellow members have invited Bradley, lead vocalist for Black Babylon, to the session. Bradley has also brought updated equipment. Rob tries to explain his side, saying that Chris has become impossible to work with due to his obsession with playing only Steel Dragon songs and his demanding perfectionism while playing them live. Chris also refuses to write his own material and accept any of the band's original compositions as well. Chris becomes furious and leaves, saying he'll never return to the band. When Rob asks Emily to stay on as their manager, she refuses and leaves as well. In the car outside, Chris discusses the incident with Emily, who tells him something better will come along.The next day Chris receives a phone call from Kirk Cuddy, guitarist and founding member of Steel Dragon. Chris is incredulous at first, even hanging up on Kirk. Kirk patiently calls back and is able to convince Chris of his identity and even plays a clip of Chris singing at a recent gig over the phone. The video of the gig was given to Cuddy by two of Blood Pollution's groupies. Kirk tells Chris to come to Los Angeles and meet him.Chris goes to LA with Emily. They are met by Kirk's personal assistant, Tania, who takes them to Kirk's mansion. Chris and Emily meet the band and Kirk offers Chris a chance to audition for the lead singer spot in the band. At that moment, Bobby Beers bursts into the studio and begins an argument with Cuddy. Cuddy points out that Beers missed most of the shows on the last tour and has missed several recording sessions. Beers, in a moment of dramatic revelation that shocks Chris, argues that he's being thrown out of the band for being gay. Eventually, Beers storms out of the studio after removing a wig revealing his real hair is short. Chris sings one of Dragon's songs, has a few false starts and watches the band confer inside the control room. After a few moments, he's offered the position. He adopts the stage name ""Izzy.""During his first show with the band, Chris quickly wins the respect of the crowd, opening with ""Blood Pollution"" one of Chris' favorites & a song the band hasn't played in a decade. Chris takes a nasty spill while descending the stage's elaborate staircase, however, he continues to perform admirably. At the wild party thrown after the show, Tania seduces both Chris and Emily. Chris discovers the next morning that Tania is a transvestite.When the band packs up to travel to their next gig, Emily isn't allowed to travel with Chris on the tour bus and is relegated to riding with the band members' girlfriends and wives in a limousine. As they trail the bus, the girls tell Emily that the band often cavorts with groupies on the bus. Emily holds her opinion that Chris would never betray her and the girls scoff. One goes to so far as to say that she has a special relationship with her husband's accountant.The tour goes on for the larger part of a year. Chris, newly introduced to the rock icon lifestyle, spends a large amount of money on drugs, cars and other excesses. Tired of following Chris all over America, Emily leaves and heads home, upset that Chris spends too much time partying with the band and not as much time devoted to their relationship. She agrees to meet him in Seattle. When she arrives there, she meets Chris, who is too drunk to know where he is. Emily tells him she's going to stay in Seattle and open a cafe with a friend of hers and that her relationship with Chris is over. When the tour finally ends, the band goes on hiatus.Six months later Chris shows up for a new recording session at Kirk's house. When he shows the band a concept sketch for their next album cover as well as some new songs, Kirk takes an arrogant stance, telling Chris that he and their other guitarist, A.C., are the only songwriters. Chris is puzzled and Kirk goes further, saying that they'd hired Chris merely to sing, not to be a part of the creative force of the band. Chris is stunned and during the vocal recording of a new song, defiantly sings it as if it were a rap tune. Kirk admonishes him and the recording session goes on with Chris singing the song properly. Chris later meets Mats in a bar and reflects on how the same manner of obsessive behavior he'd shown toward Rob and Blood Pollution was now being visited upon himself.Steel Dragon goes out on tour again to support the new album. Chris, feeling he's been duped, only puts out a half-hearted effort at most shows. One night, while performing, Chris notices a fan singing along with him, a reflection on how he'd sang along with Bobby Beers. Chris invites the fan to join him on stage and asks him if he'd like to finish the show; the young man enthusiastically accepts and Chris walks off stage, the rest of the band and the crowd hardly noticing. He says goodbye to Mats and leaves.A few years later, Chris has traveled to Seattle and has reinvented himself as an alternative rock musician. He reunites with Rob and the two form a new group, playing smaller shows in bars and coffeehouses. Emily has also moved to Seattle and opened the coffeehouse she'd talked about with an old friend. While walking in the street, she spots a flyer for one of Chris shows. She goes to it and he spots her from the stage. He walks over to her and kisses her and the two reconcile.Over the closing credits, we see that Steel Dragon's popularity has dropped off considerably with the advent of the Seattle Sound in music. Bobby Beers has also reinvented himself; as a Celtic dancer."

"""Punishment Park"" is a pseudo-documentary purporting to be a film crews's news coverage of the team of soldiers escorting a group of hippies, draft dodgers, and anti-establishment types across the desert in a type of capture the flag game. The soldiers vow not to interfere with the rebels' progress and merely shepherd them along to their destination. At that point, having obtained their goal, they will be released. The film crew's coverage is meant to insure that the military's intentions are honorable. As the representatives of the 60's counter-culture get nearer to passing this arbitrary test, the soldiers become increasingly hostile, attempting to force the hippies out of their pacifist behavior. A lot of this film appears improvised and in several scenes real tempers seem to flare as some of the ""acting"" got overaggressive. This is a interesting exercise in situational ethics. The cinéma vérité style, hand-held camera, and ambiguous demands of the director - would the actors be able to maintain their roles given the hazing they were taking - pushed some to the brink. The cast's emotions are clearly on the surface. Unfortunately this film has gone completely underground and is next to impossible to find. It would offer a captivating document of the distrust that existed between soldiers willfully serving in the military and those persons who opposed the war peacefully.::Dick Rockwell <dr1orok@atlas.moa.net>"

"White Pat Conroy was born and raised in Beaufort, South Carolina. In March 1969 under the Beaufort School District, he starts a job teaching at a small poor school located on Daufuskie Island, an island in a South Carolina river delta, the island accessible only by boat. The island is inhabited exclusively by blacks. He quickly learns that his students, who have never left the island, lack not only a basic understanding of academic items such as the alphabet and simple arithmetic, but also of other basic necessities of life such as personal hygiene. They can't even pronounce his name, they who call him Conrack. The teachers before him, including the school principal Mrs. Scott, have always treated the students as being slow and basically unteachable of academics. Conrack, a free thinking man, decides to expose his students not only to the academic subjects, but also to the gamut of life skills from brushing one's teeth to human anatomy, and some of the fun things in life like classical music, art, baseball, movies, swimming (despite living on an island, the islanders live in fear of the river because they don't know how to swim), and Halloween. He does so with compassion and without being patronizing. His teaching methods come under question by both Mrs. Scott and the Beaufort School District administration led by its superintendent, Mr. Skeffington.

Real scenes of his physical and emotional breakdown, which were captured during filming, act as a thread between fiction and reality.

The film deliberately utilizes the feel of sweeping epic, independent drama, historic newsreel and gritty verite' to tell the story. Evocative visuals, masterful sound, and poetry create a sublime sense of simplicity. Unique and diverse speeches that catalyzed the destruction of nations, provoked the assassination of their speakers, expressed the deep sorrow of leaders, and manipulated the emotions of the people, are woven within the story.

Later, Catherine sees him with a young woman and assumes they are a couple.The next day, Catherine is depressed because rain keeps them indoors.

John's mother was a schoolmate of Mrs. Allen's. Catherine and Mrs. Allen accept John's invitation to meet his family. But the Thorpes do not make a good impression. John and his sisters are loud and vulgar. Their mother comes across as greedy. His sister Isabella attaches herself to Catherine and predicts they will become the best of friends.Catherine is currently reading ""The Mysteries of Udolpho"" by Mrs. Radcliffe. She often dreams that she is the heroine of the novel. Isabella comes to call and announces that she and James are in love. He has ridden home to ask his father for permission to marry. Catherine is startled but approves of the match, reassuring Isabella that her father will no doubt give them his blessing.John takes Catherine riding in an open carriage. She doesn't realize that this is not proper. When she returns to the hotel, Mrs. Allen reprimands her. As it turns out, Mrs. Allen has just been introduced to the young man she and Catherine saw on the night of the dance. He is Henry Tilney, son of General Tilney who owns Northanger Abbey. The young woman with him that night was his sister, Eleanor.Mrs. Allen, the Thorpes, and Catherine visit the pump room. Mrs. Allen makes a disparaging remark about Isabella. Catherine is introduced to Eleanor Tilney and accepts an invitation to go walking with her and Henry the next day. Isabella and John Thorpe overhear the conversation. He wants Catherine for himself because he believes she is the Allens' heiress.As Catherine is leaving to meet Eleanor, John and Isabella show up and invite her to accompany them. Catherine refuses, explaining that she has a prior commitment with the Tilneys. John lies and says he just met the Tilneys and they asked him to tell her that they cannot go walking after all. But Catherine soon learns the truth and hurries to the Tilneys' lodgings. Breathlessly she explains what happened and her apology is graciously accepted. They arrange to go walking the next day.Catherine enjoys getting acquainted with the Tilneys. She is delighted that Henry and Eleanor have both read ""The Mysteries of Udolpho."" They go rowing and are caught in a rainstorm. General Tilney appears with his carriage to rescue them.At the next dance, Catherine is partnered by Henry. John is angry and Catherine tries to avoid him. General Tilney seems to be watching her with intense scrutiny. Catherine sees him talking with an odd-looking woman who she later learns is a Marchioness.Since Isabella is now engaged, Catherine expects her to sit out the dances. To her horror, Isabella flirts with several men and dances with Henry's older brother Frederick, an army officer. She demands that Henry tell his brother at once that Isabella is engaged, but Henry refuses. He insists that Frederick knows what he is doing. Isabella is distraught when a letter arrives from James, announcing that they cannot marry for two years. At that time James will receive a living (pastorate) from his father, worth about four hundred pounds a year. It will be very difficult to live on such a small income. Isabella declares that she doesn't mind but it is obvious that she does. The Tilneys are returning to Northanger Abbey and Eleanor asks her father's permission for Catherine to accompany them. She is often lonely, since Henry has an estate of his own and the General is frequently away. The Allens agree that Catherine may go even though it will mean cutting short her visit to Bath.Northanger Abbey reminds Catherine of the castles in Gothic novels. She is eager to explore but it is nearly time for dinner. Eleanor asks Catherine to hurry and get ready, as her father insists on promptness. Catherine gets lost on her way to the dining room and incurs the General's displeasure. During dinner, he asks Catherine several questions about the Allens.The next morning, Eleanor and Catherine meet in the gardens. Eleanor points out the walk which was her late mother's favorite. Catherine is curious about Mrs. Tilney's death and asks Eleanor. She learns that her friend was not at home at the time and that since his wife's death, General Tilney won't allow anyone to enter her bedroom. The General has not made a good impression on Catherine and she wonders if he had anything to do with his wife's death. She asks to see the room and Eleanor agrees, telling her where it is located. But the General's sudden appearance thwarts their plans.The Tilneys invite several guests to dinner, including the Marchioness. Catherine learns that she is a very good friend of General Tilney's. Feeling left out when Henry sings a duet with an attractive young woman, Catherine allows herself to be drawn outside by the little boy who is the Marchioness's servant. To impress her, he turns a series of cartwheels.At bedtime, Catherine explores a large chest in her room and retrieves several papers. Before she can examine them, she hears someone coming. Frightened, she drops the candle and jumps into bed. She has troubling dreams about the General and is relieved to awaken. The maid scolds her for dropping the candle and tries to take the papers away. Catherine demands to keep them but discovers they are old laundry lists. All except for one, which has brief directions for a meeting in the garden.One of the dinner guests has arranged for them all to go riding. Catherine is forced to wear a habit belonging to the late Mrs. Tilney. She pleads a headache and stays behind, determined to visit Mrs. Tilney's bedroom. But Henry catches her there. He returned because he was worried that Catherine might be ill. She realizes he is angry and tries to explain. Henry is even angrier when he hears that Catherine suspects his father of murder. He agrees that the General married his wife for her money; indeed she had often joked about it. But he loved her in his own way and was sincerely sorry when she died. He tells Catherine she reads too many novels. Catherine bursts into tears and runs to her room. Grabbing ""The Mysteries of Udolpho"", she rips it to pieces and tosses it into the fireplace. Then she cries herself to sleep.Eleanor awakens her with a letter from James. Isabella has called off the engagement and proven herself to be two-faced. James learned of her flirtations with other men. He warns Catherine to be careful when giving her heart.Catherine tells Eleanor that she is afraid Henry will never speak to her again. Eleanor reassures her that it isn't true. Then she confides her own romance. She is in love with a man of whom her father doesn't approve because he is poor. He and Eleanor often meet in a secluded part of the garden, which is what the message meant that Catherine saw. She is surprised to learn that the Tilneys have lost a great deal of their money. The Marchioness is addicted to gambling and General Tilney often joins her. Only Henry is still wealthy because he inherited his mother's money and property.To Catherine's relief, Henry does not mention the incident in his mother's room. The General suddenly leaves for London and Henry goes to check on his own estate. Before he returns, the General comes back. The next scene shows Catherine climbing into the carriage, dressed for travel. The General has apparently ordered that she be sent home. Henry is furious at his father and demands an explanation. The Marchioness had heard rumors about Catherine that warranted an investigation. It is likely that John Thorpe started the rumors to get back at Catherine for rejecting him. General Tilney learned that Catherine was not an heiress as she claimed, but a penniless vicar's daughter. Henry points out that Catherine never claimed to be an heiress and although her father was a vicar, he was not as poor as all that. When Catherine married she would receive four hundred pounds. That doesn't pacify the General but Henry is not about to let his father interfere in his relationship with Catherine. Back at Fullerton, Mrs. Allen and Catherine's parents discuss the situation. Mrs. Morland is proud of Catherine for being able to shift for herself. Bored with the conversation, Catherine goes outside. Suddenly Henry Tilney rides up. They embrace and kiss."

Arlington hands Norma a $100 bill from the brief case of money, and says she gets to keep it if the button is pushed or not. Arlington leaves and tells her she has 24 hours. Arthur returns and Norma tells him what has happened.After much discussion about whether or not they should press the button, and some tinkering with the box (Arthur finds nothing inside it), Norma suddenly jerks forward and hits it. The button rises slightly.Arlington returns and presents Norma and Arthur with the million, without asking whether they pressed the button or not. He informs that they will not know who will receive the offer next, and implies that Arthur, Norma, or their son will be the ones to die. Arthur storms after Arlington and attempts to return the million, but Arlington drives off. Arthur gets his license plate number.A 911 call is shown, where someone has been shot. The police enter the house and find a woman shot through the heart, and a little girl locked in the bathroom upstairs.Arthur and Norma then attend a wedding rehearsal dinner, where Arthur is instructed to select a present from a table (secret Santa). A waiter (who happens to be the student of Norma's who prompted her to reveal her disfigurement), holds up two fingers to Arthur. Arthur then sees a box much like the one left on their doorstep, with the button in it. This time, there a photograph of Arlington inside.Norma's sister tells Arthur that the student Arthur saw was the one who made fun of his wife's foot. Arthur meets and asks Norma's dad (who is a police officer) to run the license plate number of Arlington's car. Norma receives a phone call (she is informed by a waiter whose nose begins to bleed as he's leading her to the phone). It is Arlington, who scolds her for allowing her husband to make contact with the police, as Arlington somehow knows Arthur has spoken to Norma's father. Arthur angrily approaches the student from Norma's class and yells at him for making fun of Norma. He then storms out of the party, with Norma following him. As they start their car, they see ""No Exit"" (the title of the Sartre play they went to see earlier) written into the frost on their windshield.When they get home, Arthur takes their babysitter, Dana, home. Dana had earlier gone down into the basement with their son Walter, to see Arthur's Mars collection. She notices the picture of everyone who worked on the development of the camera. As they are driving, Dana acts strangely, asking Arthur strange questions such as ""Whats pushing your buttons?"" and comments like ""Look into the light."" Her nose begins to bleed and she passes out. Arthur attempts to wake her up and finds her driver's license, which shows her name is not Dana, but Sara, and she is from Boston. He reaches the motel, where ""Dana"" has been staying and she wakes up with a start. She tells Arthur it's not safe for him there, and to look in the mirror because that's the only place with the answer. She then hurries away. In the motel, every door she passes opens and a startled looking person stares her down. She reaches her room, where she has a large map and pictures of Arthur, Norma, and Walter.At home Arthur looks at the large picture in the basement, and sees that Arlington (prior to his injury) is in the photo.At a supermarket, Norma is approached by a panicked woman who tells her to look up a certain call number in the library, and not to trust her husband, before passing out with a bloody nose. Arthur finds out that Arlington's license plate is registered to the NSA. He asks Norma's father if he can go with him to see the house where the shooting mentioned earlier took place. Once there, he finds pictures of Arlington and a picture of a Human Resources book, and a library call number. Arthur learns that the woman was shot at 4:45 PM, the same time Norma pushed the button.Norma and Arthur both visit the library, separately. Norma avoids Arthur, as instructed by the woman in the supermarket. Norma finds a film reel, which shows Arlington prior to his disfigurement. Arthur is followed by a crowd of startled looking people. He finds himself in a large hall filled with more scared looking people. He approaches a woman he learns is Arlington's wife, and she tells him to follow her. He is presented with three ""gateways,"" made of hovering water. Two lead to eternal damnation, one to salvation. Remembering the student who held up two fingers, Arthur picks gate two. He enters the water and finds himself whirling through whiteness.Norma is also led by two hollow looking women to Arlington. He asks her how she felt when she saw his disfigurement, and she says she felt love, because of her foot. She says that she felt bad for herself because of her foot, and seeing someone with a face disfigurement made her realize she would never feel sorry for herself ever again. Many years ago, her brother had dropped a barbell on her foot and when she went to the doctor he put it in an X-ray machine and forgot about her, destroying the tissue in four of her toes. Arlington informs Norma that he was struck by lightning, and can now communicate with ""those who control the lightning."" Norma begins to cry and Arlington takes her hand.Norma is suddenly lying on her bed, with Arthur suspended above her in the same hovering water he stepped into earlier. Norma moves away just before Arthur falls out of the water. The water falls too, going all the way down their stairs. When cleaning up, Walter demands to know what is going on. Norma and Arthur do not answer him.More drama occurs and eventually, at the wedding of Norma's sister, their son Walter is kidnapped. Arthur is taken away by a gun-toting former employee of NASA. He is the same man who shot his wife, as earlier seen in the 911 call. He reveals to Arthur that he had to choose between his wife or his daughter. He asks if it was him or Norma that pushed the button and he replies that his wife also pushed the button. He shows Arthur the book seen earlier in the picture, and the water portals or ""triptychs."" The book is some sort of manual. They are then stopped by a man in a Santa Claus uniform, ringing a bell. As the two men are trying to figure out what is going on, they are hit by a large truck.We then see Arthur emerge from a NASA warehouse, which has been surrounded by military. He is taken away and told by his NASA friend that everything that happens next will have great ramifications. Arthur and Norma return home and see Arlington in their kitchen. He informs them they face two final options. Their son, Walter, is now deaf and blind. They can either live on with their million dollars, and their disabled son, or Arthur can shoot Norma through the heart, at which point Walter's sight and hearing will be restored and the million will be placed in a high interest bank account for Walter to be held in trust until his eighteenth birthday.We learned earlier in a warehouse full of startled people, when Arlington's minion questioned him, that Arlington's employers are testing the human race to see if they are worth keeping.Arlington leaves, telling Norma and Arthur on his way out that their son is in the bathroom, locked upstairs. The two of them run upstairs and try to get him out, but cannot because he can't hear them pounding on the door. They decide that they must make a choice, and Norma leads Arthur downstairs.Another couple is sitting at a table with a box unit, staring at it with contempt, wondering whether they should push it. The wife pushes the button. Arthur and Norma are crying and hugging each other, and say goodbye.Arthur shoots Norma, and the police arrive. He runs upstairs and sees his son is back to normal. It is implied that this process will go on and on.Arlington arrives at the other couple's house and hands them the million.Arthur's NASA friend informs him he and his son will be taken care of, as Arthur is escorted away by men in uniforms, who put him into a black car before driving off. Arthur's son looks down at Arthur leaving in that black car. Arlington then comes out of the house of other couple to whom he had given the $1 million, and the film ends."

"The movie opens with an oblique aerial view of The Maze of hedges and a pond to mark its center at Craven Castle in Scotland. A simple wooden door, marked ""Keep Out,"" swings open and title and credits roll over the bushes that make up the entry to The Maze. A light, high up in a single window of the castle shines. A man, William (Michael Pate) opens the window and calls to his co-worker, Robert (Stanley Fraser) who runs back into the castle. They discuss their master and walk back up to the tower room. As they discuss the options over the dead body of Sir Samuel MacTeam we hear a shuffling sound. Much of the story is told as a flashback by Edith Murray (Katherine Emery). Aunt Edith tells us it happened in a remote castle in Scotland. It started a year before when she and her niece gathered in the south of France at Cannes for an engagement party. Seated in the restaurant was Richard Roblar (Robin Hughes), the soon to be best man. To his right is Kitty Murray (Veronica Hurst), then Aunt Edith and finally Gerald MacTeam (Richard Carlson) on the far right. Richard and Kitty dance, this leaves Gerald and Aunt Edith alone to discuss the castle. Gerald explains that no improvements or modern conveniences have been installed in hundreds of years: no electricity, no phones, and no central heating. He also discloses that his uncle locked him in his room every night and the outdoor maze was off limits. The wedding is to take place in two weeks. Gerald and Kitty dance, leaving Edith at the table alone. Edith recounts that none of the Baronets lived but a few years after inheriting the title and Gerald was the next in line. The next day Kitty and Gerald are enjoying the pool at the hotel. A waiter brings Edith an Express Letter for Gerald from Craven Castle. She hands Gerald the letter after he and Kitty exit the pool. The letter provides few details, but it is from William and he says it is urgent he return to the castle immediately. Gerald decides to take the noon plane for London and return as soon as possible.A week has passed and Kitty and Edith check the hotel mail for any word from Gerald. Kitty expresses her concern, ""I'm worried about him. Something's wrong, I'm sure of it."" She decides to telephone, but Edith tells her niece that there are no telephones at the castle. Kitty decides to send a cable. Kitty shows her aunt a newspaper story, ""Scottish Baronet Passes."" It further explains, ""Sir Samuel MacTeam, Bart., died at Craven Castle, Scotland of a heart ailment this past weekend. He was forty-five years of age. Sir Gerald MacTeam, his nephew and successor as Baronet, has announced that the burial services will be private."" Edith and Kitty are relieved now that they know the reason for Gerald's silence. Kitty learns that all her cables were received at the castle, but none answered. Edith is convinced that Gerald is no longer interested in her niece, and advises, ""Forget him, Kitty."" Kitty convinces herself that Gerald must be in trouble and unable to reply. Six weeks later Edith, not Kitty, gets a letter from Craven Castle. She opens it with Kitty present. Gerald is vague as to the reasons, but makes it clear he will not marry Kitty: Only a death could make him reconsider. Kitty decides to visit the castle and confront Gerald and invites Edith to accompany her.A driver brings the pair to the castle. He drops off their luggage on the road and drives off without a word. The women carry their luggage to the front door and knock. William, a gray haired man, answers the door carrying a candle. When told the Baronet is indisposed, Kitty pushes her way into the castle and demands that Sir Gerald be summoned. Edith expresses her reservations, ""Kitty, we should never have come here. And the sooner we leave, the better."" Gerald walks casually down the stairs. Kitty runs to greet him, but stops short when she sees that in less than two months, since she last saw her fiancé, he looks to have aged twenty years. Rather than expressing how glad he is to see her, he tells her, ""You shouldn't have come here."" He demands that Kitty and Edith leave at once, but Kitty informs him that they will be staying. Gerald orders William to take the ladies to one of the bedrooms. The ladies walk upstairs to their rooms, but before they are out of sight, Gerald tells them, ""I expect you to leave in the morning."" William takes the ladies to a large bedroom with a connecting door to an adjoining bedroom, so each will have a bed of their own. He lights a candle and then the fireplace. Kitty is shocked and expresses her concern to Edith regarding Gerald's appearance. They are even more surprised by his inhospitable reception. Gerald sits and drinks and reminds William about the time. He glances upwards, then to William and asks what bedroom they occupy. Williams reminds Gerald that Robert will lock both their bedroom doors. Kitty and Edith sit by the fire and drink tea. Kitty notices that the window in her room has been sealed up with stones. She also notes that all the hallways have rubber coverings and that the stairs are a series of platforms, instead of steps. Edith says, ""Everything about this place is strange. I can't tell you how delighted I shall be to leave it."" But Kitty insists they will not leave until she has a chance to do something to help. She is convinced that Gerald's appearance alone is reason to believe he is sick. Edith tells her niece, ""Kitty, whatever has happened to Gerald is something evil. I can feel it in this place. And we have to get out of here before it happens to us."" They hear the door being locked. Despite protests from the women to unlock the door, Robert leaves. Edith tells Kitty about the castle rules as Gerald had told her in Cannes. Before Gerald can walk upstairs, William tells him the cleaning woman who had an attack the week before has died. She apparently died as a result of going into The Maze, despite warning to stay out. Gerald walks upstairs to the tower room.Kitty awakens during the night. She hears a strange shuffling sound out in the hall and sees only a partial shadow under the door. She sees the tapestry on the wall move and pulls it back. There is a door that leads to a very old and dirty stairwell. She claws through cobwebs and is menaced by a couple of bats. She climbs the stairs to a window; one pane is broken. Outside she can see The Maze and the bright spot of a moving candle lighting the shrubs. Again she hears the curious shuffling sound. She returns to her room and immediately wakes her Aunt Edith and tells her about what she saw. Edith reiterates her desire to leave and the sooner the better. The next morning the door is unlocked. Kitty checks on her aunt and finds she has a cold. Kitty uses it as an excuse to remain. Kitty notices strange footprints on the stairs, almost like leaf impressions. Robert catches her and immediately wipes them off. Kitty joins Gerald at the dining room table. Kitty informs Gerald that Aunt Edith is sick and it will be at least three days before they can leave, but Gerald insists the two women leave this morning. Kitty confronts Gerald about his behavior and reiterates her desire to help. Kitty asks William to get a doctor for Gerald, but he politely refuses. Kitty proposes a friend, an M.D., visit and examine her fiancé and writes a letter to Dr. Bert Drilling. Robert sees Kitty composing a letter and informs William. Before she seals the letter she reads it to Edith. The next problem is to get it posted: For that she engages the gardener, Simon (Owen McGiveney), refusing to allow William to do so after he volunteers. Kitty wanders into The Maze. She only gets in a few dozen feet when she notices the same curious footprint, if that is what it is. She crouches down to get a better look when Gerald stamps his foot down and destroys it. He grabs her arms and escorts her out of The Maze and snarls, ""Stay out of here for the rest of your visit."" Kitty tells her Aunt Edith the story and Edith decides she will have a talk to Gerald, but she is put off by the staff. During the evening lock down, Edith leaves her room first. She follows the staff upstairs quietly and at a discrete distance. She enters the tower room and hears the shuffling sound. She only catches a glimpse of a man-sized creature shuffling away. She screams, faints, and falls to the floor. Kitty is awakened by the scream and runs to her aunt's room. Gerald carries Edith to her bed; he is accompanied by William. When Edith comes to she tells everyone, ""Gerald. I went to your room and I saw something. Something horrible. It was the most horrible thing I'd ever seen...It was something alive, I saw it move."" Gerald dismisses it as imagination.Later that night Kitty is again awakened by the shadow under the door and strange shuffling sounds. The next morning Kitty checks on Edith. Gerald asks if Edith is better. Again Gerald insists they leave and Kitty promises to leave the next day. That afternoon, the guests Kitty expected arrive. Richard Roblar drove the car, along with his girlfriend, Peggy Lord (Hillary Brooke). In the backseat is Dr. Bert Dilling (John Dodsworth) and his wife, Margaret (Lilian Bond). Gerald is at the table reading a book entitled, Teratology. He hears the commotion outside and walks out to see. Kitty has already greeted her guests when Gerald comes outside. He looks daggers at Kitty. Kitty informs Gerald that their friends would like to rest before dinner. Gerald pulls Kitty aside and reads her the riot act. Kitty appeals to Gerald and begs to help, but he informs her, ""I'm not ill, Kitty. I only wish it were that simple."" She picks up the book and leafs through it, but Robert enters the room and takes it out of her hands. Kitty goes to see her guests and asks Bert what he thinks. Bert doesn't think it is physical, despite Gerald's appearance, but mental. Kitty and Edith dress for dinner, and then join the others for drinks. While everyone is laughing and having a good time, Gerald stands by the fireplace with a pained expression on his face. A noise upstairs causes Gerald to bolt the room. Bert decides to act. He tells Kitty that he will complete the necessary paperwork and have Gerald committed. Gerald returns with Robert and William and dinner is served. Kitty asks Edith to steal a key from the door so she can get out during the night. Gerald announces that everyone be in their rooms by 11:00 p.m. and that they all leave in the morning.While his wife, Margaret, gets comfortable in bed, Bert paces his room. He informs Margaret that he will shoot the lock off the door if necessary. He also tells her he did his research on the MacTeam family and it was all very strange. William informs Robert that the key from the great hall is missing, but since it is 11:30 they have other more pressing duties. Kitty takes the key and exits her room with Edith. They start up to the tower room and unlock it with their purloined key. The tower room is sparse but the windows are not blocked off. They find a piece of seaweed on the floor. They find the book. The title page explains that Teratology is, ""The Study of Monstrosities, serious malformation or deviations from the normal structure in man."" They hear the strange shuffling sound and quickly exit the tower room. Gerald leads a procession holding a candle. Robert and William carry a sheet that hides the shuffling thing beneath. Kitty and Edith return to their room. Kitty decides to follow the procession. Outside her room she discovers another 4-toed footprint that resembles a tree leaf. She also concludes that whatever the creature is, it is a person. She notes that Sir Gerald addressed it as ""Sir."" Kitty and Edith walk outside and into The Maze. They hear a splashing sound. They get separated from each other and lost when the candle goes out. They desperately try to find each other, calling and wandering. Edith confronts the creature and screams. Kitty encounters it also: A giant, man-sized toad, mouth gaping open, leaps towards her. Both frightened, they flee from each other. The giant toad exits The Maze and hops and crawls back to the house. Gerald finds Edith and orders his servants to attend to ""Him."" Kitty finally finds Gerald and her aunt, while the giant toad makes his way up to the tower inside the castle. Bert hears the noise of the toad and using his gun on the lock, escapes his room. As Bert exits his room he sees the creature and hears its elephant-like trumpeting. Williams prevents the doctor from shooting the thing as it hops upstairs. Gerald escorts Kitty and Edith back to the house, but bolts when he hears the trumpeting. The giant toad flings itself out of the tower window and crashes to the ground below. Gerald kneels next to the creature. William explains, ""He was frightened. I tried to tell him that he was safe but he wouldn't listen, Sir Gerald. When he tried to climb out of the window he was too strong for us."" Gerald assures his servant it was not his fault and directs him to carry the body inside.The next morning Kitty packs her bag. Edith is ready to leave. William informs the pair that Gerald wants to see them in the dining room. All the guests are waiting there. William also informs them that Sir Gerald is now the master. Gerald joins his guests. He sounds more like his old self. He explains that for the last few hundred years he and his ancestors were not the actual lords of Craven Castle. The real Baronet died last night, and was born in 1750. Naturally, his guests are incredulous. Gerald explains that certain amphibians can live over 200 years. He tells his guests that human embryos go through many stages. One is an amphibious stage, and Sir Roger never physically developed beyond that stage. The nephews took care of the Baronet for hundreds of years, but he administered the estate. Gerald assures Kitty it was not her fault for the death. He reconciles with Kitty. Edith explains that the two are married now and that Gerald has modernized the castle. We close with a zoom-in shot of the grave of Sir Roger. The headstone reads, ""Here lies Sir Roger Philip MacTeam, Bart. of Craven 1750-1953."""

"The two main characters of the story are Amir, a well-to-do Afghan boy from the dominant Pushtun ethnic group, and Hassan, the son of Amir's father's servant Ali, who belongs to the historically downtrodden Hazara minority. The boys spend their days in a peaceful Kabul, kite fighting, roaming the streets and being boys. Amir's father, Baba, loves both the boys, but seems often to favor Hassan for being more manly. He is critical of Amir. Amir's mother died in childbirth, and Amir fears his father blames him for his mother's death. However, he has a kind father figure in the form of Rahim Khan, Baba's friend, who understands Amir better, and is supportive of his interest in writing stories.A notoriously violent older boy with Nazi sympathies, Assef, blames Amir for socializing with a Hazara, who he claims is an inferior race that should only live in Hazarajat. He prepares to attack Amir, but Hassan bravely stands up to him, threatening to shoot Assef in the eye with his slingshot. Assef and his henchmen back off, but Assef says he will take revenge.Hassan is a ""kite runner"" for Amir: he runs to fetch kites Amir has defeated by cutting their strings. He knows where such a kite will land without even seeing it. One triumphant day, Amir wins the local tournament, and finally Baba's praise. Hassan goes to run the last cut kite (a great trophy) for Amir, saying ""For you, a thousand times over."" Unfortunately, Hassan runs into Assef and his two henchmen. Hassan refuses to give up Amir's kite, so Assef exacts his revenge, assaulting and anally raping him. Wondering why Hassan is taking so long, Amir searches for Hassan and hides when he hears Assef's voice. He witnesses what happens to Hassan but is too scared to help him. Afterwards, for some time Hassan and Amir keep a distance from each other. When Hassan wants to pick up their friendship again, Amir holds it off. When people ask what is the matter, Amir reacts indifferently. He feels ashamed, and is frustrated by Hassan's saint-like behavior. Amir worries that Baba loves Hassan more, and would love him even more if he knew what happened to Hassan and about Amir's cowardly inaction.To force Hassan to leave, Amir frames him as a thief, and Hassan falsely confesses. Baba forgives him, despite the fact that, as he explained earlier, he believes that ""there is no act more wretched than stealing"". Hassan and his father Ali, to Baba's extreme sorrow, leave anyway. Hassan's departure frees Amir of the daily reminder of his cowardice and betrayal, but he still lives in their shadow.A short while later, the Soviets invade Afghanistan. Amir and Baba escape to Peshawar, Pakistan and then to Fremont, California, where Amir and Baba (who lived in luxury in an expensive mansion in Afghanistan) settle in a run-down apartment and Baba begins work at a gas station. Amir eventually takes classes at a local community college to develop his writing skills. Every Sunday, Baba and Amir make extra money selling used goods at a flea market in San Jose. There, Amir meets Soraya Taheri and her family; Soraya's father is contemptuous of Amir's literary aspiration. Baba has lung cancer but is still able to do Amir a great favor: he asks Soraya's father to grant permission for Amir to marry her. He agrees and the two marry. Shortly thereafter Baba dies. Amir and Soraya learn that they cannot have children.Amir embarks on a successful career as a novelist. Fifteen years after they said goodbye, Amir receives a call from Rahim Khan, now dying from an illness, who asks him to come to Pakistan. He enigmatically tells Amir ""there is a way to be good again"". Amir goes.From Rahim Khan, Amir learns the fates of Ali and Hassan. Ali was killed by a land mine. Hassan had a wife and a son, named Sohrab, and had returned to Baba's house as a caretaker at Rahim Khan's request. One day the Taliban ordered him to give it up and leave, but he refused, and was murdered, along with his wife. And the secret truth about Hassan is that Ali was not his father. Hassan is the son of Baba, and thus Amir's half-brother. Finally, Rahim Khan reveals that the true reason he has called Amir to Pakistan is to go to Kabul to rescue Hassan's son, Sohrab, from an orphanage.Amir returns to Taliban-controlled Kabul with a guide, Farid, and searches for Sohrab at the orphanage. However, he does not find Sohrab there. The director of the orphanage tells them that a Taliban official has recently taken the boy. He tells Amir to go to a football match and look for aTaliban official making speeches; this will be the man who took Sohrab.Amir goes and secures an appointment with him at his home. There he finds out that the Taliban official is actually his childhood nemesis Assef. Sohrab is made to dance dressed in women's clothes, and it seems Assef might have been sexually assaulting him (Sohrab later says: ""I'm so dirty and full of sin. The bad man and the other two did things to me""). Assef agrees to relinquish him, but only if Amir can beat him in a fight to death, with Sohrab as the prize. Assef brutally beats Amir, but Amir is saved when Sohrab uses his slingshot to shoot out Assef's left eye, fulfilling the threat his father had made years before.Amir tells Sohrab of his plans to take him back to America and possibly adopt him, and promises that he will never be sent to an orphanage again. Sohrab is emotionally damaged and refuses to speak. This continues on for about a year until his frozen emotions are temporarily thawed when Amir reminisces about his father, Hassan, while kite flying. Amir shows off some of Hassan's tricks, and Sohrab begins to interact with Amir again. In the end Sohrab only shows a lopsided smile, but Amir takes to it with all his heart as he runs the kite for Sohrab, saying, ""For you, a thousand times over."" This is an echo of the last words spoken to Amir by Hassan before the rape, and signifies the sense of atonement that permeates the novel.

"After spending years in California, Amir returns to his homeland in Afghanistan to help his old friend Hassan, whose son is in trouble.::Anonymous"
"In the 70's in Afghanistan, the Pushtun boy Amir and the Hazara boy Hassan, who is his loyal friend and son of their Hazara servant Ali, are raised together in Amir's father house, playing and kiting on the streets of a peaceful Kabul. Amir feels that his wise and good father Baba blames him for the death of his mother in the delivery, and also that his father loves and prefers Hassan to him. In return, Amir feels a great respect for his father's best friend Rahim Khan, who supports his intention to become a writer. After Amir winning a competition of kiting, Hassan runs to bring a kite to Amir, but he is beaten and raped by the brutal Assef in an empty street to protect Amir's kite; the coward Amir witness the assault but does not help the loyal Hassam. On the day after his birthday party, Amir hides his new watch in Hassam's bed to frame the boy as a thief and force his father to fire Ali, releasing his conscience from recalling his cowardice and betrayal. In 1979, the Russians invade Afghanistan and Baba and Amir escape to Pakistan. In 1988, they have a simple life in Fremont, California, when Amir graduates in a public college for the pride and joy of Baba. Later Amir meets his countrywoman Soraya and they get married. In 2000, after the death of Baba, Amir is a famous novelist and receives a phone call from the terminal Rahim Khan, who discloses secrets about his family, forcing Amir to return to Peshawar, in Pakistan, in a journey of redemption.::Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"
"In 1978 Kabul, adolescent Amir Qadiri's best friend is Hassan, the son of his family's servant, Ali. Hassan will do whatever for the respect of his best friend. Among other things they do together, they compete as a team in kite fighting competitions, Hassan who is a natural runner in knowing where the cut kites will eventually land. Amir's family are ""ethnically superior"" Pashtuns, whereas Hassan's family are ""ethnically inferior"" Hazaras. Regardless, Amir's wealthy widowed father, who Amir calls Baba, considers Hassan the son he would have wanted as he sees Amir as being a weak minded boy who indulges too much in creative writing. When Amir and Hassan are confronted by older local bully Assef, it is Hassan who always stands up to him. In the face of what Amir sees as this lack of outward love from Baba to him, Baba's friend, Rahim Khan, provides Amir with that fatherly type assurance. On a day that should be the most triumphant in both Amir and Hassan's young lives and one where Amir may finally receive the respect from Baba he so craves, Amir witnesses an incident with Hassan, who is unaware that Amir saw what happened, that will forever change their lives. Fast forward several years to the San Francisco Bay area, where Baba and Amir eventually settle following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. There, they have led a working class life. Amir, the aspiring writer, eventually marries Soraya, a Pashtun Afghani like himself, who has lived a working class life in the United States after being in the privileged class in Afghanistan. In 2000, after Baba has passed away, Amir receives a telephone call from Rahim Khan asking him to return to Afghanistan for a special mission concerning Hassan's orphaned son, Hassan and his wife having been murdered by the Taliban. When Amir learns of his own family's history in the story, Amir does what he can to honor the memory of his old friend Hassan. He not only has to beware of the Taliban in general, but an old nemesis in particular who has only gotten more sadistic with age.::Huggo"

There are a bunch on children in a suburban neighborhood getting hurt in unusual ways. One mother's child gets hurt and she goes looking for answers and finds them but its with twist no one would expect.
"In 1913, in Carlton Mine, Addytown, Pennsylvania, the cruel owner of a mine exploits poor immigrant children. After an explosion, a group of children are buried alive.Present day. Karen Tunny has just lost her husband after a long period of terminal illness and has inherited her husband's home by Carlton Mine. She moves to Carlton Mine with her two daughters, the 16-year-old Sarah and the 10-year-old Emma.Sarah meets a couple of teenagers around her age. She mentions to them that she lives up in the hills and one of them replies ""Up where the zombies are?""William Carlton, a cynical and greedy local businessman and the last surviving heir of the Carlton who owned the mine in 1913, is hungrily devouring property and kicking people off his own property, which he claims goes from the mine to Addytown, which is very perplexing to Karen, since she lives on part of this land. Carlton wants to build a fancy ski resort near the mine. Hanks, a neighbor, tells Karen that the only way she can stay on her land is if Carlton dies. In that event, the land goes back to the ""miner's deed"", or those like Hanks and Tunny, who now live on the land.Many people are known to have gone missing in the vicinity, and the plumber, Mr. Thompson, who helps the Tunny family to fix their place, is another victim. William Carlton's two associates, helping him to survey the land and plan for the ski resort, are two others when they are killed by unseen figures.As it turns out, the Tunny's and Mr. Hanks are all relatives of the zombie-like children, who protect relatives, while killing all others. Emma informs her mother that the ""zombies won't eat me"" and on another occasion, that they wouldn't hurt her mom, but others they might. Karen finds some old photo albums in the basement with her husband in them, as well as the Tunny and Hanks children who died in the mine disaster, thus revealing that the family is related to some of the children who died.Karen is advised by her neighbor, Hanks, to stay at home in the night when the zombie children roam the nearby forest. He also tells her that there is no need to thank him for the blood smeared on his and the Tunny's door. The blood has a repellant effect on the zombie children. Meanwhile, Emma is making trips to the mine, where she meets and befriends Mary, who is one of the zombie children that suffered an untimely demise. Her mother, however, believes Mary is imaginary. Karen makes Emma promise not to go back to the mine, but Emma still goes out with Mary. At times, Mary even comes to the Tunny place, her former home, to sleep with Emma, her newfound relative/friend.One night, Sarah, with her new friends hang out in a car. Unbeknownst to them, the zombie-children approach the car. The boyfriend leaves the car to check out some strange noises where he is slain by the children. Sarah's ""boyfriend"" takes the driver seat and pushes the pedal but the car is stuck in the mud. He exits the car in hopes of moving the car out of the mud as Sarah takes the wheel. Suddenly, a zombie-child appears in front of the car as Sarah and her friend scream. The zombie-child jumps on top of the car and walks toward the guy who is desperately trying to move the car. Since his back is towards the zombie-child, he does not see the child swing his scythe in the air and impale him. Sarah and her friend continue to scream as the zombie-children break the windows and try to take the girls. They take Sarah's friend, as Sarah helplessly continues pushing on the pedal. She sees her friend bludgeoned by the children. Miraculously, she is able to get the car out of the mud. As she escapes, she cries ""It didn't happen! It didn't happen!""Sarah arrives home to relay the horrific events that just occurred. Bewildered, Karen agrees to leave Carlton immediately. First, though, they run upstairs to fetch Emma. Unfortunately, Emma is not there, but Karen knows that Emma probably went to the mine with Mary.Karen and Sarah leave the house to go look for Emma. They enter the mine and Sarah is scared by a hand like tree root. They hear voices and leave the mine. Surrounded by all the zombie children, they run and find a car on the road (with Carlton inside), and enter telling them to drive but the tires are slashed before they can go anywhere. Karen and Sarah run to Hanks' house and are there until they hear a knocking on the door. They debate to open the door and William Carlton is standing there and tells how his driver was eaten alive by the zombies. The zombie-children break all the windows and attempt to climb in the windows but Carlton and Hanks keep them at bay with their guns. They decide to make a run for it and head to Hanks' truck. They run into some problems when the truck woun't start and head to the barn instead. The zombie-children come and start looking in the windows. They then break open the door. Hanks explains that they want Carlton. They let the children pass and they find Carlton at the top of the barn. Below blood starts coming through the slats and falls onto Hanks, Sarah and Karen. You then hear ""Mommy?"" The crowd of zombie-children parts and Emma is standing there with Mary. Karen starts walking toward Emma and embraces her. Emma then tells her that they wont hurt anyone anymore. Karen looks at Mary and the zombie-child smiles.In the final scene, Tunnys are driving away; they are moving. Sarah asks why they didn't sell the house. Emma remarks she's glad they didn't. Karen agrees.Back at the house, Hanks looks at the house and walks away. All the windows are boarded up. In one of the bedrooms, the zombie Mary is sitting on a bed and her brother zombie closes the door.THE END"

"CIA analyst Douglas Freeman (Jake Gyllenhaal) is briefing his chief in a square in North Africa when a suicide attack kills his boss and 18 other people. The target was interrogator and torturer Abasi, but he is unharmed.Egyptian-born Anwar El-Ibrahimi (Omar Metwally), a chemical engineer who lives in Chicago with his pregnant wife Isabella (Reese Witherspoon) and their young son, is linked to a violent organization by telephone records indicating known terrorist Rashid placed several calls to Anwar's cell phone. While returning to the US from a conference in South Africa, he is detained by American officials and sent to a secret detention facility near the location of the suicide attack depicted earlier. Isabella is not informed and, growing worried, travels to Washington and slowly pieces together details of Anwar's detention.For lack of more experienced staff, Freeman is assigned the task of observing the interrogation of Anwar by Abasi Fawal (Igal Naor). After Freeman briefly questions and tortures Anwar himself, he is convinced of Anwar's innocence. However, his boss insists that the detention continues, justifying such treatments as necessary to save thousands from becoming victims of terrorism. Eventually Anwar confesses to having advised on how to make more powerful bombs, and to have been promised $40,000 in return. However, Freeman believes it is a false confession, which is confirmed when he Googles the names Anwar gives as Rashid's aides and finds out that they are the names of the Egyptian football team from the year Anwar left Egypt. He also expresses doubt as to whether Anwar would be willing to put his life, family and job in danger for $40,000 when he earns $200,000 in his job. He quotes Shakespeare in a discussion on the value of intelligence gathered through torture:I fear you speak upon the rack, Where men enforced do speak anything. Without the consent of his superiors, Freeman orders Anwar's release and lets him escape through a clandestine trip by ship to Spain. Anwar returns to the US and is reunited with his family. Freeman then leaks the details of Anwar's detention to the American press. The story is then found in the newspapers the following day by Corrine Whitman, who ordered Anwar's extraordinary rendition.Another story line is shown in parallel, but at the end of the film it turns out that all this happened before the suicide attack: Abasi's daughter Fatima (Zineb Oukach), has run away from home with her boyfriend Khalid (Moa Khouas), whose brother died in Abasi's prison. Unknown to Fatima, Khalid is a terrorist. He is the one who carries out the suicide attack with Abasi as the target. But Fatima finds out from the photos that Khalid's brother met his death at the hands of her father, and realizes what Khalid is planning. At the town square Fatima begs him not to do it, arguing that the target is her father. After removing the pin of his detonator he hesitates, and is therefore killed by the organizers of the attack. As a result he releases the handle of the detonator, and the bomb explodes, killing Fatima also.The record of a phone call supposedly made by Rashid to Anwar is not explained in the film. However, earlier it was mentioned that phones are sometimes passed on from one person to another, yet despite this reasonable doubt the CIA officials refused to release him. It turned out that in South Africa, while Anwar's phone was off, there had been a call to it from an unknown person.For the scenes of Abasi's private life it is not always clear to which storyline they belong, that before or after the explosion. Abasi learns about Fatima's death only a week later."

The tanks notice them and begin to drive toward them. A battle ensues in which some of the men dig holes in the snow, wait for the tanks to drive over them and then stick grenades to the back of the tanks. With a combination of grenades and Molotov cocktails the Germans manage to destroy all of the tanks, though they suffer heavy losses. They are all honorably reinstated.The Germans are then seen burning down a village while taking all of the Russians prisoner. The Lt. and his men are told that they are not going on leave. Instead they are forced to execute Russian prisoners. The Russian boy is among the prisoners. The Lt. tries to say that the boy worked for them and therefore should not be executed. Captain Haller makes them execute him anyway. Fritz says he is going to leave, and the Lt. says he no longer feels bound to his oath to stop him. Fritz leaves along with GG (Sebastian Rudolph) and the Lt. As they are on their way they encounter a camp of Russian refugees. A man tells them how to get to Pitomnik in exchange for some bread. As they travel further they find some dead German soldiers who were wounded and had passes to go home for being wounded. They each get a pass and plan to use them to go home.At the airport the wounded are being inspected to ensure they are truly wounded and that it wasn't self-inflicted. After passing the inspection they are part of a large group pushing to try to get on a plane. They do not make it onto the plane. They meet back up with the other men. A plan flies over and drops a container of food and medals. The men begin to eat some chocolate and Rollo finally gets his Iron Cross that he wanted. As they do this, Captain Haller comes out and points a gun at them, telling them that he wants a report filed and that in the German army looters are to be shot. The Lt. tries to grab the gun from him and the Captain shoots GG. Rollo shoots the Captain, who proceeds to beg and plead with them. The Lt. says, You want a report? The Russian boy was named Kolya. And his name was Müllerlike a lot of others. They then shoot Captain Haller.They go to the Captains house that he told them about and find it full of supplies. They find a girl in a room, tied up in a bed. They decided to go by rank, which means the Lt. would go first. The rest of the men leave the room, and the Lt. walks over and cuts the girls ties. The other men are listening to music, drinking and washing themselves. They begin playing cards, as they were in the beginning, and the line 'Herz ist Trumpf' is heard again. We see the Lt. in the room with the girl, who happens to be Irina, the girl he met in the sewers. She says she wants to be shot, so the Lt. gives her his gun and says to shoot herself. She can not, and they end up sitting and talking. Their injured Captain, Captain Musk (Karel Hermánek), who they brought with them, points a gun at them and tells them to be soldiers not deserters. Otto tells him that every night he prays to be killed. He then pulls out his gun, says Heil Hitler and shoots himself in the head. Rollo carries Captain Musk out and discovers a line of German officers, including the General, walking in a line with their hands raised, surrendering. The remaining two go with the Irina, who says she can get them out.Irina leads the two through the snow. As they head to where she is leading them, shots are heard. Irina yells I am Soviet! but they continue to shoot, killing her. Fritz and the Lt. crawl away, and sit in the snow holding each other and talking to each other about the best thing about the cold until they both freeze to death. The movie ends with them covered in snow and tells us that over 1 million people died in the battle of Stalingrad. It says that of the 260,000 people of the 6th Army, 91,000 were taken prisoner and only 6,000 of them ever returned home."

"The film begins with a flashback narrated by Leland P. Fitzgerald, describing how he couldn't remember the details of the day that he killed an intellectually disabled boy named Ryan Pollard. Leland is arrested. Ryan's parents, Harry and Karen, sisters Becky and Julie, as well as Julie's live-in boyfriend Allen grieve the loss of their loved one. Leland's divorced mother, Marybeth, is desperate to see her son, while his father, famous writer Albert Fitzgerald, discovers his son's fate in a newspaper and returns home to be there for the trial.While in juvenile hall, Leland is schooled by teacher Pearl Madison, an aspiring writer who is searching for a breakthrough story. Like many others at the detention center, Pearl senses there is something different about the emotionally detached Leland, and helps him circumvent the prison rules so he can keep a journal. While his girlfriend is out of town in Los Angeles, Pearl sleeps with a coworker and tells her that he is going to write a book about Leland.Through his discussions with Pearl, Leland reveals his childhood memories such as his grandmother's funeral and traveling long distances to visit his father. One time, he decided to stay in New York rather than continue on to see his father. After he couldn't find a hotel to sleep in, a kindhearted family, the Calderons, decided to take him in for his stay. He continued to visit the family over the years, and was especially captivated by Mrs. Calderon. The two also discuss Leland's history with Becky, Ryan's sister. He had met her innocently at a record store and begun regularly walking home with her and Ryan after school. They had grown to love each other, and Leland recalled a time when Becky asked him to promise her ""everything's gonna be okay"", despite his objections that he had no control over bad things that could happen. As she explained, sometimes it's just nice to hear things one hopes to be true.Pearl covertly arranges a meeting with Leland's father at his hotel. After he asks for more information on his family's past, Albert realizes Pearl is researching for his book and refuses to let his son be exploited - something he is guilty of himself. He eventually tells the prison supervisor about Pearl's prohibited meetings with Leland, leading him to be reassigned to another section of the prison.Leland discovers through Allen that Becky had had an affair with a drug dealer named Kevin who is due to be released from prison. After he gets out of prison, Becky starts to see Kevin again and decides to break up with Leland. In a rare display of emotion, he argues with her, but ultimately realizes the futility of anything he can do or say to change her mind, saying that neither the tears nor the amount of his love - he says he still dreams about her - can change the fact that she does not love him in return. Pearl says, he should be angry with her since she betrayed him. Leland replies that he is sad, but not angry.Pearl begins to realize the implications of his sexual indiscretion through his discussions with Leland, and admits his own failings. Eventually, his girlfriend discovers his tryst and they have a fight over the phone. Meanwhile, Julie decides to break up with Allen and doesn't want him to go to college. Brokenhearted, he holds up an auto repair shop and allows himself to be arrested in front of Julie. He is sent to the same juvenile hall as Leland, where he steals a knife (from Pearl) and kills Leland in the prison yard as revenge for what he has done to the Pollard family.Pearl flies to LA to reconcile with his girlfriend and reads Leland's final entries in his journal. On one of his return trips to New York, Leland had discovered that Mrs. Calderon had divorced her husband and that the spark for life that she had before was gone; it is implied Leland and Mrs. Calderon had slept together. Afterwards, Leland writes, he begins noticing a sadness in everyone around him, driving him into a deep depression. One day, as he walks Ryan home from school, the boy becomes frustrated with an obstacle on the bike path. Leland helps him off his bike, gives him a hug, and whispers in his ear that ""everything is going to be okay""."

"It's the not too distant past in the working class Eastern Townships of Quebec. In the approach to Christmas, much of the focus of the town is on the general store, owned and operated by Antoine and Cecile, the former who also acts as the town's undertaker. The focus on the store is due to the Christmas shopping by the townsfolk and their want to see the nativity display in the store's window. Fernand, who works as a clerk in the store, has a secret focus of his own. Also working in the store is teenager Carmen, whose wages go to her abusive father. Because her father does not want her beyond her money earning ability, Carmen lives at the store with Cecile and Antoine. But quietly behind the scenes is the ever seeing Benoit, Cecile and Antoine's nephew who also works at the store and who in his pubescent state is in lust with Carmen. The one person who they probably will not see this Christmas season is Jos Poulin. Like all the other men in town, Jos worked in the asbestos mine, which he hated. As such, he has since left his loving wife Elise and his five children behind to go work in a logging camp. But real life still happens in the Poulin family during his absence, a specific situation which Antoine and Benoit must deal with and which threatens to expose the insecurities in the primarily publicly stoic Antoine.::Huggo"
"The story opens with an unseen hand painting a swimming human figure. As the illustration is finished, the background shifts to a desert landscape and the figure blends in with the dunes.A biplane is flying across Northern Africa. In the front seat is a woman who appears to be asleep. The plane is spotted by a military outpost. The soldiers begin yelling in German and open fire on the plane with a flak cannon. The plane is severely damaged. The pilot attempts to pull the woman from the front of the plane but it soon bursts into flame and the man is forced to bail out. His face, arms and chest take the full force of the fire. The man is later found by a small group of Bedouins, who transport him to a camp where a healer mixes a salve from a series of small vials and applies it to the horrific burns on the pilot's face.At a seaside resort in Tuscany in 1944, a British officer is interrogating the same man, whose face and hands have mostly healed but have left him weak, scarred and in need of regular morphine injections to stifle the pain. The pilot is being tended to by a young nurse named Hana. The man admits to being able to speak both English and German and that he can't remember anything before his accident. Finding it very difficult to breathe, he asks the British officer to let him rest.Hana is later seen in a camp near a battle zone in Tuscany donating blood. A nearby patient, who is close to death, asks if there's anyone in the tent from his Canadian home town. Hana's friend Jenny mentions that Hana's fiancé is from the same town. The dying soldier says that he was killed a couple of days ago. Hans becomes distraught; she believes she's cursed and that anyone who tries to be close to her dies.The medical unit packs up and heads north through Italy, following the Allied front as they push the German army back into Europe. As the caravan drives along a gravel road, Jenny comes alongside Hana's truck in a jeep, asking Hana for money to spend in the next village. Hana laughingly refuses but still gives Jenny some money. As her jeep zips away it hits a mine and explodes. While a couple of men sweep the road with metal detectors Hana suddenly walks past them toward Jenny's jeep. The mine crew yells for her to stop, telling her she could step on another mine. Hana has spotted a small bracelet belonging to Jenny in the road -- one of them men carefully picks it up and gives it to her. The other man, a Sikh in a turban, goes back to disarming a mine he'd found.Hana decides that she'll take the burned man to a abandoned villa on a nearby hilltop and tend to him until he dies. Her commanding officer is reluctant but also realizes she can use some time off from the front line. He tells her to rejoin the unit in Livorno after the burned man dies.Hana sets about making the bombed-out villa livable and has her patient settled into one of the bedrooms. A stranger shows up, David Caravaggio, whom is missing both thumbs. He claims to be working for the Italian government, disarming local citizens and partisans before they can cause trouble behind the front. Caravaggio brings her some eggs and slyly steals a few vials of morphine that Hana has for the patient.The man in the turban, Kip, also shows up when Hana plays Bach on an old piano. He fires a single pistol shot to stop her so he can inspect the piano, saying that the Germans would place bombs in pianos to kill civilians. Surely enough, he finds one. He says he'll stay with his junior officer, Hardy, and inspect the rest of the house and property for more explosives. Hana jokes with Kip about how her mother always said she'd summon the man she'd marry by playing the piano.The burned patient remembers the time before the outbreak of the war, despite his claim that he has amnesia. Then known as Count Laszlo de Almásy, a cultured and introverted Hungarian cartographer, he was part of an expedition to map the Sahara Desert from the air. Almásy's best friend is Madox, who helps bring in a couple of wealthy benefactors to fund their efforts. The donors are Geoffrey and Katherine Clifton who have also brought another plane that will help expand their expedition. Almásy is leery of Katharine joining them in the desert, but is also very attracted to her. He meets her one day in the Cairo bazaar after she's bought a woven table covering. He insists they take it back to the merchant she bought it from, saying she'd been cheated because she didn't bargain with the man, something the merchants find insulting. She insists they don't bother.Geoffrey flies off to Cairo on business, leaving Katherine behind. The group inspects a remote area where Almásy discovers a hill in the shape of a woman's back, a legend he'd been informed of by an old Bedouin. Nearby he finds a cave filled with ancient drawings of people swimming. The team spends a few days documenting and exploring the cave while Katherine takes the opportunity to paint watercolor illustrations of the swimmers. She offers to paste them into Almásy's worn copy of Herodotus' Histories but he politely refuses, saying the paintings are ""too good."" She walks away insulted however Almásy is fearful of becoming too close to her.While driving back to Cairo, one of their trucks tumbles down a sand ridge and overturns. Several of the party, including Madox and a couple of injured members, agree to drive back to Cairo for help. Katherine stays behind so as not to weigh down the convoy. That night everyone is forced to take refuge in the trucks while a sandstorm rages. Katherine and Almásy talk about various types of desert storms. Almásy lightly strokes her hair; Katherine doesn't resist. The two fall asleep and miss Madox' return. They then dig out the 2nd truck and begin to dig up supplies that were scattered in the wreck. Katherine tucks a few of her small watercolor paintings into Almásy's copy of Herodotus' Histories. They are interrupted by Madox, who'd set off a flare because he was lost.Back in Cairo, Katharine visits Almásy at his hotel room and the two begin a torrid love affair. In the bath together, they talk about what they missed while in the desert and seem happy until Almásy tells her that she should go back to Geoffrey. Katharine becomes upset and leaves in anger. However, their attraction to each other is too passionate and they continue the affair. At a lavish dinner party that marks the end of their expedition due to the outbreak of World War II and halt to their funding, Almásy arrives late and drunk. He regales the group with an explanation of the censored lyrics to Irving Berlin's ""Cheek to Cheek"". Though he makes an embarrassment of himself, he calms down and joins the group for dinner. Later he dances with Katharine but their time together is awkward. Geoffrey takes notice of odd behavior in his wife and suspects she may be involved with Almásy.At the villa, Caravaggio confronts Hana, asking some pointed questions about her patient. She mostly refuses, suspicious of his motivations. Caravaggio has his own history, connected to Almásy: he was an important figure working for the Allies before the Nazi campaign in Northern Africa and was hunted by the Germans. While the city of Cairo is invaded by the German navy and Luftwaffe, one of Caravaggio's commanding officers rants about how the Germans were able to make a lightning strike on Cairo using the very maps that Almásy, Madox and the Cliftons had drawn. While standing in a crowd of people being documented by the Germans, Caravaggio tried to leave his line and was captured. He was interrogated for an indeterminate period of time, chained in a small room. A German officer, Mueller, knew that Caravaggio was an Allied spy who operated under the alias ""Moose"". Demanding he give up the names of his comrades, Mueller cruelly has a Muslim nurse cut off Moose's thumbs with a straight razor. Moose vowed revenge against both Mueller and the man who'd given a picture of him to the Germans. After finding and killing Mueller, believing also that Almásy is the man he's been looking for. Hearing from one of Hana's friends that she was tending to a patient who carried a copy of Herodotus' Histories and was an expert on popular songs, he set out to find her.A romantic relationship begins to develop between Hana and Kip. One evening he takes her into the nearby town of Siena to see the frescoes in the town's cathedral. Kip has arranged a rope and pulley system to lift Hana off the floor to see them up close. Hana is grateful for such a romantic gesture and she and Kip spend an intimate night in the villa's barn. Hardy comes looking for Kip the next morning, saying a large bomb had been found under a nearby bridge. Hana looks very worried, thinking the curse that haunts her will kill Kip. While Kip tries to disarm the bomb, a convoy of Allied tanks and other vehicles roar across the bridge. Kip remains very cool and is able to disarm the bomb, collapsing in relief upon it.The raucous convoy had been celebrating big news: the war in Europe is over. The whole town erupts in in joy, with a group led by Hardy climbing a bronze statue in the main square. Back at the villa, Hana, Caravaggio and Kip are all dancing happily when they see a flash in town and hear an explosion. Kip races to the scene and finds the statue Hardy had been climbing and his friend bloodied and dead. A junior officer explains they were drunk and goofing around when Hardy climbed the statue and a bomb went off. Kip locks himself in the barn for a long period, mourning the loss of his friend. When he finally comes out, he talks to Hana about his friend, about how they were friends but never really spoke of anything too personal. He still wishes to continue his relationship with Hana and will find her when things have calmed down.Almásy relates the final part of his story before his injury to Caravaggio when the latter accuses him of killing Geoffrey and Katharine. Back in the desert, Almásy is finishing the job of packing up the group's base camp near the Cave of Swimmers. Geoffrey had volunteered to fly out and pick him up but on his approach he flies in too fast, seemingly aiming for Almásy. The plane crashes, narrowly missing Almásy. When Almásy reaches the wreck, he finds Geoffrey dead and Katharine in the front seat, badly injured. She tells him that Geoffrey was ranting during the last seconds of their flight, saying he loved her. As Almásy carries her to the cave, she finally admits her love for him and he cries. In the cave, he builds her a fire and binds her broken ankle. He also tells her she has a few broken ribs making it difficult to breathe. He leaves her with a small lantern, his copy of Herodotus and a few pencils. He tells her he'll hike through the desert to find help. He spends three days walking and finally arrives at a British army outpost. Desperate to return to the Cave of Swimmers, he rants about Katharine dying out in the desert, begging the British soldiers to give him a jeep. When he becomes angry and grabs one of them, another hits him, knocking him out. He wakes up shackled in the back of a jeep with the guards claiming, due to his unusual accent, that he might be a German spy. On a train to the Mediterranean coast, he asks if he can use the toilet. He tricks the guard into thinking the door to the toilet is locked and attacks the man, killing him and unlocking himself. He jumps from the train and limps off. He finds the German army in the desert, who happen to have taken possession of Madox' plane. Giving them the maps he and his team had produced, Almásy is able to acquire the plane and enough fuel to rescue Katharine. However, Katharine has already died alone in the cave, having written a last letter to Almásy. He flies out with her body, returning to the opening scene of the story where his plane is shot down by the Germans.
Hana visits Almásy one last time in the villa, preparing to give him his morphine. As she prepares another syringe, he weakly pushes the remaining vials to her, silently asking her to inject them all so he'll die. She weeps but does so, a peaceful smile crossing his face. When she joins a small group heading out of the area in a truck, she smiles to herself."

Because of the difficulty traveling and the dangers, especially as the landscape is still heavily booby-trapped with mines, Hana volunteers to stay behind at a church to care solely for a dying semi-amnesiac patient, who is badly burned and disfigured. She agrees to catch up to the rest of the unit after he dies. All the patient remembers is that he is English and that he is married. Their solitude is disrupted with the arrival at the church of fellow Canadian David Caravaggio, part of the Intelligence Service, who is certain that he knows the patient as a man who cooperated with the Germans. Caravaggio believes that the patient's memory is largely in tact and that he is running away from his past, in part or in its entirety. The patient does open up about his past, all surrounding his work as a cartographer in North Africa, which was interrupted by the war. He may not be running from his work as a spy for the Germans as Caravaggio believes, but rather the memory of an affair he had with married Katherine Clifton, the love of his life, and the memory of a promise not totally fulfilled. Hana may also test her theory of her fates with love and death as she embarks on a relationship of her own with Kip Singh, a Sikh from India, whose unit has camped on the now overgrown lawn of the church.

Given the name Charlie Malick as a contact by an acquaintance named Ed Faber, Axel is able to get a job working as a stevedore in Charlie's gang on the dockyards. Little did Axel know that Charlie is corrupt, requiring payola for that job, and is a racist. It is solely because of the color of his skin that Charlie hates his fellow gang boss, Tommy Tyler, a black man. It is also because he can see that Axel is a little wet behind the ears that Tommy tries to befriend him to get him out from under Charlie's thumb. Due solely to the reason that he is a drifter, Axel is slow to warm and open up to Tommy, eventually providing some basic information: that he is originally from Gary, Indiana, that his real surname is Nordmann, and that the only person he has ever really loved in his life was his older brother Andy, whose death exacerbated the already strained relationship he has with his police officer father.

"In the year 1899, aboard the steamer Nellie, anchored in the River Thames near Gravesend, England, Charles Marlow tells his fellow sailors about the events that led to his appointment as captain of a river-steamboat for an ivory trading company.10 years earlier. Marlow describes his passage on ships down the African coast and then into the interior to the Company's Outer Station of the Belgian Free State, which strikes Marlow as a scene of devastation: it is immensely disorganized, machinery parts scattered here and there; demolition explosions serving no apparent purpose are carried out periodically; native black men are chained together, wasted, demoralized, and literally being worked to death, and strolling beside them is another native working as a uniformed guard, carrying a rifle. At this station Marlow meets the Company's chief accountant who tells him of a Mr. Kurtz, explaining that Kurtz is a widely respected, first-class agent who brings in more ivory for the Company than all the other agents combined.Marlow departs with a caravan to travel on foot some 200 miles deeper into the wilderness to the Central Station, where the steamboat that he is to captain is based. When he arrives, he is shocked to learn that his steamboat had been wrecked two days earlier. The manager explains that they had tried to take the steamboat up-river because of rumors that an important station was in jeopardy and that its chief, Mr. Kurtz, was ill. Marlow describes the Company men at this station as lazy, back-biting ""pilgrims"", fraught with envy and greed, all trying to gain a higher status within the Company, which, in turn, would provide more personal profit; however, they seek these goals in a meaningless, ineffective and lazy manner, and Marlow senses that they are all merely waiting, while trying to stay out of harm's way. After fishing his boat out of the river, Marlow is frustrated by the months it takes to perform the necessary repairs, made all the slower by the lack of proper tools and replacement parts at the station. During this time, he learns that Kurtz is far from admired, but more or less resented (mostly by the manager). Not only is Kurtz's position at the Inner Station highly envied, but sentiment seems to be that Kurtz is undeserving of it, as he received the appointment only through his European connections.Once underway, the journey up-river to Kurtz's station takes two months. On board are the manager, three or four ""pilgrims"" and some twenty indigenous ""cannibals"" enlisted as crew. The steamboat stops briefly near an abandoned hut on the riverbank, where Marlow finds a pile of wood and a note indicating that the wood is for them and that they should proceed quickly but with caution as they near the Inner Station.The journey pauses for the night about eight miles below the Inner Station. In the morning, the crew awakens to find that the boat is enveloped by a thick white fog. From the riverbank they hear a very loud cry, followed by a discordant clamor. A few hours later, as safe navigation becomes increasingly difficult, the steamboat is attacked with a barrage of small arrows from the forest. The pilgrims fire blindly into the bush with their Winchester rifles, and the native serving as helmsman gives up steering to pick up a rifle and fire it. Marlow grabs the wheel to avoid snags in the river. The helmsman is impaled by a spear and falls at Marlow's feet. Marlow sounds the steam whistle repeatedly, frightening the attackers and causing the shower of arrows to cease. Marlow and a pilgrim watch the helmsman die, and Marlow forces the pilgrim to take the wheel so that he can fling his blood-soaked shoes overboard. Marlow and the rest of the crew presume (wrongly) that Mr. Kurtz is dead.In a flash forward, Marlow notes that the International Society for the Suppression of Savage Customs had commissioned Kurtz to write a report, which he did eloquently. A handwritten postscript, apparently added later by Kurtz, states ""Exterminate all the brutes!"" Marlow expresses that he does not believe Kurtz was worth the lives that were lost in trying to find him.After putting on a pair of slippers, he returns to the wheel-house and resumes steering. By this time the manager is there, and expresses a strong desire to turn back, but at that moment the Inner Station comes into view.At Kurtz's station, Marlow sees a man on the riverbank waving his arm, urging them to land. Because of his expressions and gestures, and all the colorful patches on his clothing, in between which possessions are shuffled, the man reminds Marlow of a harlequin. The pilgrims, heavily armed, escort the manager on to the shore to retrieve Mr. Kurtz. The harlequin-like man boards the steamboat, and turns out to be a Russian wanderer who had happened to stray into Kurtz's camp. He explains that he had left the wood and the note at the abandoned hut. Through conversation Marlow discovers just how wanton Kurtz can be, how the natives worship him, and how very ill he has been of late. The Russian admires Kurtz for his intellect and his insights into love, life, and justice, and suggests that he is a poet. He tells of how Kurtz opened his mind, and seems to admire him even for his power... and for his willingness to use it. Marlow, on the other hand, suggests that Kurtz has gone mad.From the steamboat, through a telescope, Marlow observes the station in detail and is surprised to see near the station house a row of posts topped with the severed heads of natives. Around the corner of the house, the manager appears with the pilgrims, bearing a gaunt and ghost-like Kurtz on an improvised stretcher. The area fills with natives, apparently ready for battle, but Kurtz shouts something from the stretcher, and the natives retreat into the forest. The pilgrims carry Kurtz to the steamer and lay him in one of the cabins, where he and the manager have a private conversation. Marlow watches a beautiful native woman walk in measured steps along the shore and stop next to the steamer. She raises her arms above her head and then walks back into the bushes. Marlow overhears Kurtz arguing with the manager, claiming his work at the Inner Station is not yet finished and that the Company is interfering with his plans. When the manager exits the cabin he pulls Marlow aside and tells him that Kurtz has harmed the Company's business in the region, that his methods are ""unsound"". Later, the Russian reveals that he believes the Company wants to kill him and remove Kurtz from the station, and Marlow confirms that hangings had been discussed. The Russian then informs Marlow that Kurtz had ordered the natives to attack the steamer, hoping the men from the Company would abandon their mission to remove him. The Russian insists that he must leave immediately, referring to a canoe waiting for him, and before he departs he notes how delightful it was to hear Kurtz recite poetry.After midnight, Marlow discovers that Kurtz has left his cabin on the steamer and returned to shore. He goes ashore and finds a very weak Kurtz crawling his way back to the station house, though not too weak to call to the natives for help. Marlow threatens to harm Kurtz if he raises an alarm, but Kurtz only laments that he had not accomplished more in the region. Marlow appreciates his serious situation, and when Kurtz begins in a threatening tone, Marlow interjects that his ""success in Europe is assured in any case""; at this, Kurtz allows Marlow to carry him back to the steamer. The next day they prepare for their journey back down the river. The natives, including the ornately dressed woman, once again assemble on shore and begin to shout unintelligibly. Noticing the pilgrims readying their rifles, Marlow sounds the steam whistle repeatedly to scatter the crowd of natives. Only the woman remains unmoved, with outstretched arms. The pilgrims open fire as the current carries them swiftly downstream.Kurtz's health worsens on the return trip, and Marlow himself becomes increasingly ill. The steamboat breaks down and while it is stopped for repairs, Kurtz gives Marlow a packet of papers, including his commissioned report and a photograph, telling him to keep them away from the manager. When Marlow next speaks with him, Kurtz is near death; as he dies, Marlow hears him weakly whisper: ""The horror! The horror!"" Marlow blows out the candle and tries to act as though nothing has happened when he joins the other crew members for dinner. A short while later, the ""manager's boy"" appears and announces in a scathing tone: ""Mistah Kurtz - he dead."" The next day Marlow pays little attention to the pilgrims as they bury ""something"" in a muddy hole. He falls very ill, himself near death.Upon his return to Europe, Marlow is embittered and contemptuous of the ""civilized"" world. Many callers come to retrieve the papers Kurtz had entrusted to him: Marlow offers the report entitled ""Suppression of Savage Customs"" (with the postscriptum torn off) to a representative of the Company, knowing that he is really looking for papers that might disclose the whereabouts of ivory rather than a humanistic treatise, but the man refuses the document. To another man, who claims to be Kurtz's cousin, Marlow gives family letters and memoranda of no importance. He then gives the report to a journalist, for publication if he sees fit. Finally Marlow is left with some personal letters and a photograph of Kurtz's fiancée, whom Kurtz referred to as ""My Intended"". When Marlow visits her, she is dressed in black and still deep in mourning, although it has been more than a year since Kurtz's death. She presses Marlow for information, asking him to repeat Kurtz's final words, which in fact are ""The horror! The horror!"" echoing in his mind. Uncomfortable, Marlow lies and tells her that Kurtz's final word was her name."

She asks him for $250, but doesn't tell him why she needs it. After a few questions, her father gives her the money.Later that evening, Baby returns to the place where the staff dirty dances, finds Penny, and presents her with the money. At first, Penny refuses. Billy tells Baby that he can only get Penny an appointment with a doctor the following Thursday, the day Penny and Johnny are booked to dance at the Sheldrake, another Catskills hotel. If they cancel, they'll lose an entire season's pay.Although she has very little dance experience, Baby volunteers to fill in for Penny, and Johnny eventually agrees to teach her Penny's moves. They begin with a mambo, to a short excerpt from an unnamed Latin song, then the Surfaris' recording of 'Wipeout'. Over the next week, Baby takes dance lessons from Johnny. Progress is slow, but with Johnny's patient instruction and Penny's assistance, Baby begins to catch on.After a particularly exhausting rehearsal, a frustrated Johnny yells at Baby for a misstep. Baby shouts back at him,reminding him that she is doing all of 'this' to save his job, and vents her frustration at the fact that, despite the Sheldrake gig being just two weeks away, he hasn't shown her the 'lift' move. This other side of Baby wins Johnny's respect, and he agrees to start 'lift' practice straight away. With that, he whisks her off in his car to a meadow, with 'Overload' playing in the background. To teach her balance, they dance on a tree trunk that has fallen over a stream to 'Hey! Baby'. As Hey, Baby! continues, they practice some lifts for their dance number in the nearby lake. At the Sheldrake gig, Johnny and Baby dance to 'De Todo un Poco'. Their performance goes reasonably well even though Baby is so nervous that she aborts the dance's climactic lift.When Johnny and Baby get back to Kellerman's, Billy informs them that Penny's abortion was botched by a quack. When Baby sees Penny in agonizing pain, she runs to get her father, who treats Penny and asks who is responsible for Penny, and Johnny says he is, which Dr. Houseman mistakenly assumes means that Johnny got Penny pregnant.After saving Penny's life, then forbidding Baby from having anything further to do with ""those people"", Baby defies her father and goes directly to Johnny's cabin ('These Arms of Mine' playing in the background) and apologizes for the way her father behaved. Johnny tells Baby she's brave. She demurs, saying she was scared of never feeling for the rest of her life the way she feels when shes with him. When the record changes to 'Cry to Me', she asks him to dance with her, which turns into a dance of seduction... leading to Baby and Johnny having sex.The next day when Baby visits Penny to see how she's doing, Johnny shows up. Penny realizes that he and Baby are having an affair, so after Baby leaves, Penny reminds Johnny about his own admonition about not getting involved with the guests, but he doesn't listen. Later we see Johnny and Baby in bed together with 'Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow?' playing in the background.The next day while Mickey and Sylvia's recording of 'Love Is Strange' plays, we see dancing on the lawn, a volleyball game in progress, and Johnny and Baby rehearsing a cha-cha. Johnny, however, can't keep his mind on the dance. They lip sync the song, particularly ""How do you call your lover boy? Come here, lover boy ..."". Neil comes up the stairs, they hear him and hastily stop.Neil wants to propose that Johnny does something different for the final show of the season. Johnny gets excited that he may be allowed to finally do his own thing this year, but all Neil will allow is to replace the mambo with a pachanga. When Neil leaves, Baby scolds Johnny for letting Neil talk down to him, but Johnny reminds her that he needs this job the following summer.A little later when Baby and Johnny are walking together, she has him duck so her father doesn't see them together; then Johnny scolds her for not telling her father about their relationship.Later Baby tracks Johnny down in Penny's room; 'You Don't Own Me' is playing in the background. Robbie comes by, sees them, assumes Johnny is having sex with Baby, and makes a snide remark about having picked the wrong sister. Furious at Robbie for getting Penny pregnant and abandoning her, Johnny beats Robbie up.At a rehearsal for the final night talent show, Lisa rehearses a pitiful hula number (un-named song), during which one of the women guests, Vivian, tells Johnny she's arranged ""something for the two of them"" that evening. A few minutes later, Vivian's husband, who plans to play cards all weekend, offers Johnny a sizable tip to give his wife some extra dance lessons, but Johnny declines, saying he's all booked up for the weekend, at which Vivian is annoyed, but does nothing about it then.Later that evening, Lisa walks toward the employee cabins, intending to allow Robbie to finally make love to her (we hear 'Yes' on the soundtrack.) When she reaches Robbie's cabin, there is a towel hanging on the doorknob, which she does not recognize as a staff signal for ""Do not disturb"". First she knocks, then she enters, where she finds Robbie in bed with Vivian.Cut to Johnny and Baby in bed together, again after another night of passion, with 'Still of the Night' playing. Johnny tells her he dreamed they were walking together and met her father, who put his arm around him just like he had seen him do to Robbie. Later as Johnny and Baby kiss goodbye on the porch, Vivian sees them together and mutters: ""Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.""The next morning at breakfast, Max tells the Housemans that someone stole Vivian's husband's wallet from his jacket while he was playing poker some time between 1:30 and 4:00 a.m. Johnny is the prime suspect, as Vivian reported him in the vicinity at the time. Baby protests that she knows Johnny didn't do it, and to save him from being fired, confesses that she was with him in his cabin all night, even though she knows her father will be angry.A little later, Baby apologizes to her father for not telling him the truth, but also accuses him of not telling her the truth: She says he's always told her that everyone is equal and deserves a fair break, and that she should better the world, but what he really wanted was for her to become a lawyer or an economist and to marry an Ivy League grad. Dr. Houseman is moved, but not enough to open up to her.While Johnny is eventually cleared of the theft charge when the police find the real thieves (an elderly couple named Mr. and Mrs. Schumacher), he is fired for having a relationship with a guest. Baby is distraught that Johnny got fired anyway, but he is proud of her for standing up for her principles and acting selflessly. Johnny and Baby say goodbye, her loneliness underscored with 'She's Like the Wind' (sung by Patrick Swayze).The resort's season finale begins with Neil leading the group in singing an anthem to Kellerman's (to the tune of 'Far Above Cayugas Waters'). Baby and her parents are seated at a corner table. Lisa, dressed in her hula outfit, sings and dances.Dr. Houseman, who still believes Robbie is a fine, upstanding medical student, presses an envelope on him, presumably containing a sizable check for his medical studies. Robbie thanks him, and expresses his appreciation for his handling the ""Penny situation"". Suddenly realizing it was Robbie who got Penny pregnant, Dr. Houseman grabs the envelope and stalks away.During another chorus of the anthem, Johnny shows up, finds Baby, and after expressing the now most memorable line in the movie, ""nobody puts Baby in the corner"", escorts her to the stage. Dr. Houseman starts to object, but his wife restrains him. Once on stage, Johnny interrupts the boring musical tribute to the resort, and announces that even though he's been fired, he always performs the last dance of the season. He announces that his partner will be not only a great dancer, but someone who proved that there are people willing to stand up for other people no matter what it costs them. He introduces her as Frances, as she's no longer a baby; she's a grown woman.Johnny and Baby dirty dance to 'I've Had The Time of My Life', the energy in the entire hall picks up, and the rest of the staff join in. Baby allows herself to trust both Johnny and her own capabilities, as Johnny lifts her high into the air as they'd been supposed to do in their Sheldrake performance (the pose that became the most recognizable image from the film). The assembled guests catch the spirit of the dance and join in while Max Kellerman acknowledges that the world is changing quickly.While everyone is still dancing, Baby and Johnny head for some privacy, but are stopped at the door by Dr. Houseman, who apologizes to Johnny and compliments Baby on her performance. Johnny and Frances/Baby return to the dance floor and Johnny lip-syncs the song's lyrics about having the time of his life and owing it all to her. The film ends with the camera panning out and up to show everyone in the hall enjoying the dance.During the closing credits, we hear a reprise of 'Yes' and more of Cousin Brucie's radio DJ patter."

"In 1963, Frances ""Baby"" Houseman, a sweet daddy's girl, goes with her family to a resort in upstate New York's Catskill Mountains. Baby has grown up in privileged surroundings and all expect her to go on to college, join the Peace Corps and save the world before marrying a doctor, just like her father. Unexpectedly, Baby becomes infatuated with the camp's dance instructor, Johnny Castle, a man whose background is vastly different from her own. Baby lies to her father to get money to pay for an illegal abortion for Johnny's dance partner. She then fills in as Johnny's dance partner and it is as he is teaching her the dance routine that they fall in love. It all comes apart when Johnny's friend falls seriously ill after her abortion and Baby gets her father, who saves the girl's life. He then learns what Baby has been up to, who with and worse, that he funded the illegal abortion. He bans his daughter from any further association with ""those people"". In the first deliberately willful action of her life, Baby later sneaks out to see Johnny, ostensibly to apologize for her father's rudeness, and ends up consummating her relationship with Johnny. A jealous fellow vacationer sees Baby sneaking out of Johnny's bungalow the next morning, and in an act of retribution, tells management that he is responsible for a theft the evening before, knowing he would not furnish his real whereabouts.::Amanda W, amended by Linda C."

"A very true movie. So true I could not watch it until now. From someone who has been there, seen it, lived through it, I can say it was written by someone who was there as well. The story is of a young woman, Ellen (Renee Zellweger) who comes home for the weekend from her busy life in the city and with a possible writing career in front of her to find out from her father (William Hurt) that her mother, Kate (Meryl Streep) is ill. She is about to have cancer surgery and he expects that she will drop her life and come home to take care of her mother. She will need help after the surgery and the following chemotherapy. Ellen does not know what to think. She is a writer, as her father, an english professor, does he not understand what her life and future career mean to her? She has never seen self sacrifice before, or so she thinks. As her mother grows ever weaker Ellen gets a glimpse into her mother's life. She is involved with the community on special ocassions, she refinishes furniture, makes curtains, cooks everything wonderful, and even comforts friends in times of challenge, but most important of all, she makes her husband's life possible. At first Ellen tries to step into her mother's shoes and has a tough time for she is more like her father, she writes, she doesn't cook, clean, and comfort. Soon she finds her mother's shoes are a lot harder to fill than she ever realized. As she gets better at caring for her mother and the home front she realizes just how little her father does at home. Many of us see what many probably don't see, he is not completely self-scentered he simply can't imagine his life without her and can not be around to watch her fade.Ellen does not know this, at one point she believes he is having an affair and becomes very angry with him. She believes all he can do is think about himself. At Thanksgiving her father surprises everyone by bringing home two writers he admires, seemingly oblivious to the fact that this might well be his family's last Thanksgiving together. He asks that his wife whip up some great appetizers, as though she were in any shape to do so, which leaves Ellen to make them. Ellen is enraged with the unexpected visitors, famous or not, she wanted a quiet family Thanksgiving. Ellen becomes confrontational at every turn with her father. He wants everything to remain the same, he's not willing to help out with anything, and to top it all off, she believes when he calls to say he is working late that he is with ""the other woman"" who drops him off in front of the house later that evening. Ellen finally has a bitter confrontation with her father in a diner that ends up with him walking away stating that she will no longer be needed she can return to the city. Before this can even be discussed her mother is hospitalized. They are told the cancer has spread and there no need to continue therapy, all they can do now is make her comfortable.Her mother has noticed what is happening with Ellen and her father and calls her into a room to talk. She looks Ellen in the face and tells her that she does not know anything about her husband that she doesn't know. Life and marriage changes as it moves along and you find yourself accepting things you told yourself you'd never do. That it can be unbearable at one point and joyous the next. That you reach a point where if you remove someone from your life all it does is leave is a great big hole in your life, you live for your family, the ones you love. She then tries to tell Ellen things she might need for later in life and Ellen does not want to hear them. Her mother begins to cry and tells her that she's tired of people not letting her talk when she wants to talk, when Ellen agrees, she thinks a minute then says, I said it already.Ellen is charged with caring for her mother and giving her pains pills, morphine, now that the pain is much worse. Even though Ellen knows she's dying, and that she is in a wheel chair, and that a nurse comes in to help her, all these facts are really made quite clear when her mother calls out for the nurse who is not there and Ellen enters the bathroom to find her mother in the tub unable to get out. For the first time she is not seeing her bulky sweaters and cap; she sees her mother with her half bald head and barely covered bones. She is so skinny that Ellen can easily lift her from the tub. At that moment Ellen realizes exactly what is happening; to know something is one thing, to see it is almost too real. After she gets her mother settled into her chair she asks Ellen for a pain pill, as she takes it she whimpers, ""This is no way to live"" in her weakened voice that tells volumes. She asks Ellen to help her make it stop,Ellen's mother is now staying down stairs in a hospital bed. When she sleeps you hear her struggling to breathe, eating is no more, drinking is barely so, and talking is barely so. Then we see Ellen take out the small dish we all have for our cancer victims to put a little bit of applesauce to try in vein to get them to eat anything, and to help get medications down. Then she takes out the morphine and begins to smash the pills, first one, then another, then another. Then stands there knowing she can't do this. As much as she knows it would be a kindness, as much as she knows it would make it easier for her mother she can not do it.Her father comes home early, Ellen takes a bath and when she comes down we see her father wash out a small dish, wipe it and put it back in the cupboard. He tells Ellen, ""your mother says this is not living, and she was right."" Ellen goes into to be with her mother and finds awake and she tells her, ""I love you."" In the morning Ellen's father comes downstairs to find Ellen holding her mother's hand and staring, he realizes she is gone.Throughout the movie we have seen Ellen telling a man the story of her mother's illness but we don't know who he is, a greif counselor? A priest? It is a man wanting to know how Ellen's mother died of an overdose. Ellen has been providing stories that make it impossible for her father to be responsible, while not implicating herself either.In the last scene Ellen is at her mother's grave planting bulbs in the freshingly dug up soil. Her father approaches her and watches what she is doing and asks her how it went. She tells him it went fine that the man will also want to speak to him as well. Her father then says he admires Ellen's strength, he wanted to do it but could not. Ellen hears him but it doesn't sink in right away. She finally lifts her head and says, ""I didn't do it, I thought you did it."" They both take a moment and then shake their heads while stating, ""oh, she couldn't have, she was too weak!"" Ellen's father then shares how much he loved her, that she made his world warm and comfortable, she was his One True Thing. As the movie concludes her father attempts to help plant the bulbs and they work the soil together."

"One True Thing is a family drama revolving around a dying mother's final months in the care of her daughter. Ellen Gulden's father rebukes her for not caring enough about her mother to quit her job, move back home to Upstate New York, and leave her soulmate behind to fend for himself in their tidy New York apartment. But, when she succumbs under the strain of guilt and does as he asks, it appears that he is too busy to carry his part of the load. In fact, it begins to look like Ellen's father is more concerned with who is going to keep his life running smoothly than who will tend to his poor wife as she struggles with cancer. George Gulden is a gifted professor and English department head, but he is an unrealized novelist. His novel, ""Come Back Inn,"" is still unfinished after many years of torturous self-editing and rewrites long after the advance he received from his publisher is spent. Still, he basks in the reflected glow of more famous and successful writers with whom he maintains tenuous ties. This realization humanizes him for Ellen who has always revered her father as something of a literary giant in spite of his occassional daliances with graduate students. Kate Gulden, dying of cancer at only 48, loves life, and loves her children and her husband. When her suffering finally ends from an overdose of morphine, the District Attorney suspects Ellen of having helped her mother to end her life. In the end, though, it seems to be Kate who still nurtures them, somehow even from the grave.::Mark Fleetwood <mfleetwo@mail.coin.missouri.edu>"

"Along Mulholland Drive above Los Angeles, an attractive brunette woman (Laura Harring) rides in a limousine. Suddenly, the driver stops and orders her out of the car at gunpoint. Before she can exit, a car driven by joy-riding teenagers plows into the limo. The drivers are killed but the woman emerges from the wreck. In a daze, she stumbles down the hillside and into Hollywood. She falls asleep in the bushes in front of a luxury apartment complex from the golden era of Hollywood. The next morning, she sneaks into one of the apartments as its tenant, Ruth Elms (Maya Bond), leaves by taxi with her luggage. Meanwhile, two police detectives (Brent Briscoe and Robert Forster) find an earring at the scene of the accident and realize that someone may have survived the crash. They begin their search.At a Winkie's restaurant, Dan (Patrick Fischler) tells Herb (Michael Cooke) about a frightening dream he has had involving an evil entity living in the alley behind the restaurant. Herb insists they investigate. As they reach the alley, a crone with blackened skin lurches out at Dan, who collapses.Betty Elms (Naomi Watts) arrives in Los Angeles from Deep River, Ontario. At the airport, she explains to an elderly couple she met on her flight that she hopes to make it big as an actress. Her Aunt Ruth is allowing Betty to stay in her apartment while she is away filming in Canada. When Betty arrives at Ruth's apartment building, Coco Lenoix (Ann Miller), the friendly landlady, greets her and lets her in. Exploring the apartment, Betty finds the brunette cowering in the shower and assumes the woman is a friend of her aunt's. The unknown woman is dazed and confused and just wants to sleep. She explains that she had a car accident. Inspired by a Gilda (1946) movie poster hanging up in the bathroom, she takes the name Rita but admits she doesn't remember who she really is. Betty and Rita open Rita's purse and find thousands of dollars and a bizarre blue key. They hide these objects in a hat box and decide to solve the mystery of Rita's identity together.Filmmaker Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux) is in a meeting downtown with his agent, two producers and the thuggish Castigliane brothers (Dan Hedaya and Angelo Badalamenti). The brothers show the filmmakers a headshot for an actress named Camilla Rhodes (Melissa George) and order Adam to cast her as the lead in his new film. Adam refuses to let the brothers override his authority as the film's director and angrily leaves the meeting, smashing the brothers' limousine with his golf club before speeding away in his Porsche. He arrives home to find his wife Lorraine (Lori Heuring) in bed with the pool cleaner Gene (Billy Ray Cyrus). Adam retaliates by pouring pink paint over all of Lorraine's jewelry. The three tussle and the muscular pool man throws Adam out. Later, some goons sent by the Castiglianes appear at the house, looking for Adam. One of them beats up the wife and the pool man. Meanwhile, Adam hides out in a low rent motel downtown. The proprietor, Cookie (Geno Silva), tells Alex that bankers called him to say that Adam was broke, a fact that Adam's assistant Cynthia (Katharine Towne) confirms. She also tells Adam that ""The Cowboy"" (Lafayette Montgomery) wants to meet with him at a corral in Beachwood Canyon. At their meeting, the Cowboy tells Adam he must cast Camilla Rhodes as the lead actress. ""You'll see me one more time if you do good, and two more times if you do bad,"" he warns.In another downtown office, Joe, a hit man (Mark Pellegrino), kills an acquaintance in order to confiscate a black address book. Because of his incompetence, he winds up having to kill two other people-- a lady who sells mail order diet aids in the next office (Diane Nelson) and a janitor (Charles Croughwell) whose vacuum cleaner shorts, setting off the fire alarm. Later, at Pink's on Melrose and La Brea, Joe tells a prostitute (Rena Riffel) to be on the lookout for a brunette woman who recently went missing and may have ended up on the streets.Betty and Rita go out for coffee at the same Winkie's where Dan and Herb discussed Dan's dream. There they phone the police and learn that there was an accident reported on Mulholland Drive. Rita also reads the name ""Diane"" on their waitress' name tag and remembers the name ""Diane Selwyn."" They find an address for a woman with this name in the phone book and make a plan to investigate.One of Coco's tenants, Louise Bonner (Lee Grant) wanders up to the apartment where Betty's staying to warn Betty that ""someone's in trouble!"" Coco tells Betty that Louise is clairvoyant and her warnings are often correct. Coco also advises Betty to put Rita out.Aunt Ruth has arranged an audition for Betty. As Rita runs lines with Betty, the two women can't help but laugh at the bad dialogue. Likewise, everyone at the audition seems like they're just going through the motions, including the over-the-hill romantic lead, Jimmy Katz (Chad Everett). Betty suddenly loses herself in the role, giving an electrifying performance that takes Jimmy by surprise and excites the director, Wally Brown (James Karen). She does so well that the casting director immediately takes her to see Adam Kesher. They arrive at the sound stage where Adam is auditioning actresses for the lead role in The Sylvia North Story, the part earmarked for Camilla Rhodes. Betty and Adam make eye contact and seem to connect. Adam watches Camilla lip synch to Linda Scott's ""I've Told Ev'ry Little Star"" and announces halfheartedly that she has the role. Before she can meet Adam, Betty rushes back to the apartment to keep her date with Rita to visit Diane Selwyn's place.Betty and Rita first knock on #12. A woman answers, but it's not Diane, it's a neighbor who tells the women that she switched apartments with Diane, and they can find her in cottage #17. The neighbor wants to accompany Betty and Rita to #17 because she says that Diane ""still has some of my stuff,"" but her phone rings and she goes back into her apartment to answer it.No one answers when Betty and Rita knock on the door of Diane's cottage, but when they slip in through a back window, they find the decomposing corpse of a woman in the bedroom. Distraught, Rita tries cutting off her hair when she and Betty return home, but Betty persuades her to wear a blonde wig instead. That night, Betty invites Rita to share the bed with her rather than sleep on the couch. Rita gets into bed naked and after a few moments, the women find themselves making love. Betty tells Rita that she is in love with her.Later that same night, Rita wakes up next to Betty speaking in Spanish and, despite the late hour, insists that Betty accompany her downtown to Club Silencio. In her blonde wig, Rita looks more like Betty. At the club, Rebekah Del Rio (herself) lip synchs a Spanish version of Roy Orbison's ""Crying."" Betty and Rita, deeply moved, cry. Betty reaches into her purse and finds a blue box. She and Rita return to the apartment and take the odd blue key out of the hat box. Betty suddenly disappears, leaving Rita to open the box with the key. The box seems to swallow the bedroom, then drops to the floor. Aunt Ruth enters the bedroom looking as if she heard a sound, but it is empty of even the box. In Diane Selwyn's apartment, the Cowboy tells her it is time to wake up.Diane Selwyn (Naomi Watts) wakes up in her bed one morning, apparently from a dream in which she was Betty, to the sound of someone pounding on the door. Donning a grubby bathrobe, she shuffles into the front room to answer it. It's the same neighbor Betty and Rita met, still impatient to collect the rest of her stuff from Diane's apartment. The neighbor gathers up her things and on her way out mentions that ""those two detectives came by again, looking for you.""At that moment, Diane notices a normal door key, coloured blue, on her coffee table. She then sees Camilla Rhodes (now played by Laura Elena Harring) in the kitchen, and is overjoyed until she realizes it is a hallucination. Diane and Camilla met on the set of a film. Both actresses auditioned for the lead role in The Sylvia North Story, but the role went to Camilla. The two became lovers and Camilla managed to secure small roles for Diane, but she was growing tired of their relationship and broke it off. This devastated Diane. Camilla's open flirtation on set with director Adam Kesher made the pain all the worse. The final humiliation came when Camilla invited Diane to a dinner party at Adam's house on Mulholland Drive. Camilla met Diane at the same spot where the accident occurred in Diane's dream and led her up the hill along a romantic secret pathway to the house. But once inside, Camilla kissed another woman (Melissa George) and announced her engagement to Adam in front of Adam's mother Coco (Anne Miller).Enraged, Diane hired Joe, a hit-man, to kill Camilla. Diane paid Joe the cash and showed him Camilla's headshot at Winkie's, where a waitress named Betty served them and a customer Diane dreamt as Dan watched them arrange the hit. Joe tells Diane that once he has completed the job, he will leave a blue key in her apartment -- the exact key that Diane has now found.At night, behind the restaurant, the creature with the blackened skin fondles a box identical to the one in Diane's dream. With reason to believe that the police are closing in, wracked with guilt, depressed and plagued by bizarre hallucinations, Diane commits suicide, shooting herself in the head and collapsing dead on the bed where Betty and Rita found Diane's corpse in the earlier fantasy.*****As the film begins, a surreal image of people doing the jitterbug is shown. The sound of a cheering crowd accompanies a ghostly image of a young blonde woman and an old couple, all of whom are smiling (apparently before said crowd). The final image of the blonde woman waving dissolves into a point-of-view shot, with the camera panning over a bed and moving into a pillow. The scene then fades black and switches to a street sign""MULHOLLAND DR.""illuminated by headlights. A young, dark-haired woman (played by Laura Harring) is being driven up Mulholland Drive in Los Angeles late at night. She is threatened by two men inside the car with a gun. Before they can kill her, however, their limousine is smashed into by a carload of drag racing teenagers. The nameless, dark-haired woman suffers from a head injury and subsequent amnesia. As the sole survivor of the crash, she wanders down the hillside into L.A., finds refuge behind some bushes, and falls asleep. The next morning she awakes and sneaks into a vacant apartment. A young and perky aspiring actress named Betty Elms (played by Naomi Watts), who has just arrived in Hollywood from Deep River, Ontario, moves in and discovers her in the shower. It is revealed that the apartment, which is part of a complex managed by a feisty older woman named Coco (played by Ann Miller), belongs to Betty's Aunt Ruth, who is away making a movie in Canada. The dark-haired woman sees a poster for the movie Gilda starring Rita Hayworth and decides to call herself ""Rita"". She tearfully admits to Betty that she has amnesia, and together the two of them try to piece together her identity. While going through Rita's purse for clues, they discover $50,000 in cash and an unusual blue key.Betty (Naomi Watts) arrives in Los Angeles; pictured with Irene (Jeanne Bates)Strange, seemingly unrelated events follow. At Winkie's, a local diner, a man named Dan tells his companion Herb about a recurring nightmare involving a shadowy person living behind the restaurant. When Herb encourages Dan to confront his fear by exploring the rear parking lot, he encounters a terrifying figure and collapses from fright.One subplot involves the efforts of shady film executives to strong-arm a young, arrogant director. The director, Adam Kesher (played by Justin Theroux) finds his latest project stolen by men who appear to be mobsters, who show him a headshot of an unknown blonde actress named Camilla Rhodes (played by Melissa George) and order him to cast her as the film's lead. When Kesher refuses, his life is turned upside down. Returning home, he stumbles upon his wife in bed with the pool cleaner (Billy Ray Cyrus), who beats him up and throws him out of the house. Kesher checks into a seedy hotel, upon which the manager informs him there is trouble with his credit cards. Kesher then receives a call from his female assistant who informs him he is out of money, and that the film's cast and crew have been let go. The assistant also passes on instructions summoning him to meet ""the Cowboy"" at a ranch just outside of L.A. Kesher, skeptical but compliant, arrives and finds a threatening man dressed as a cowboy. He tells Kesher that he must give the role to Camilla Rhodes to avoid further trouble. At the next casting call, the actress whose headshot he had seen, Camilla Rhodes, arrives and auditions. The casting director asks him if he has something to say, whereupon Kesher obediently declares, ""This is the girl.""In another subplot, a bungling hit man steals a ""black book"" of names and addresses, leaving behind three dead bodies. He, along with two police detectives, are all trying to track down the dark-haired woman now known as ""Rita"".Meanwhile, Betty goes to a Hollywood acting audition and performs brilliantly. She is then taken to a sound stage where she catches a glimpse of Adam Kesher, who has just caved in to the mobsters' demands by hiring Camilla Rhodes for his new picture. Betty abruptly flees from the sound stage to pick up Rita, following a clue to the apartment of a mystery woman named Diane Selwyn. This leads to their discovery of a rotting corpse, which is presumably a murdered Diane. Rita, fearing that the same people who harmed Diane are after her as well, decides to disguise herself by wearing a blonde wig. That night, Betty and Rita become lovers and sleep together.Rita later awakens and insists that she and Betty attend a performance at an eerie midnight theater called Club Silencio, during which Betty begins shaking and both women cry uncontrollably. After Betty discovers a small blue box in her handbag, both women return to their apartment. Betty suddenly vanishes and Rita, finding herself alone, opens the blue box with the blue key from her purse.An emotionally hurt Diane (Naomi Watts) exchanges words with Camilla (Laura Harring). After this, an entirely new reality suddenly emerges. Betty wakes up and finds herself a depressed and lonely failed actress named Diane Selwyn. While alone in her apartment, Diane appears to flashback to recent traumatic events. Her former lover, an actress named Camilla Rhodes (now played by Harring), has abandoned her to pursue a life of riches and glamour by marrying a successful director, the same Adam Kesher who appeared earlier in the film. Feeling betrayed and humiliated, Diane meets the same hit man from the previous reality at Winkie's diner and pays him thousands of dollars in cash to kill Camilla. After receiving confirmation that Camilla has been killed (by the appearance of an ordinary blue key) and now under police suspicion, the guilt-stricken Diane loses her mind, is terrorized by hallucinations, and shoots herself.****Diane Selwyn (Naomi Watts), an idealistic, ambitious and naive young woman, wins a jitterbug dance contest in Deep River, Ontario, that offers a trip to Hollywood as first prize. Late in the film, we discover that Diane has traveled to LA to pursue an acting career but has been disappointed by most of her encounters with film industry people and has failed to find success. Instead she strikes up a romance with a charismatic and successful actress Camilla Rhodes (Laura Harring), who gets a big part Diane had applied for but uses her influence to get Diane bit parts.Camilla treats Diane carelessly, dumping her to marry her director Adam Kesher, as well as to pursue a new romance on the side with a young un-named actress. Things come to a head at a Mulholand Drive party hosted by Camilla and Adam to announce and celebrate their marriage. Diane, still in love and obsessed, is invited to the party by Camilla and the two arrive at the event by chauffeured limo. At the party Diane sees Camilla kissing a young girl (Melissa George) and confronted fully with what is going on, is devastated. In a rage at her lover's betrayal and her own humiliation, Diane hires Joe Messing, an incompetent hit man, to murder Camilla. At their meeting in Winkie's restaurant, Joe shows Diane a blue house key that she will receive as his signal when the hit has been completed. Diane retreats to her dumpy apartment, receives the blue key, and fueled by drugs and alcohol, loses her mind and begins to hallucinate as detectives investigating Camilla's murder arrive at the apartment and bang loudly at the door.The bulk of the film (presented first) is composed of Diane's elaborate dream-fantasy-nightmare-hallucination, in which she re-imagines herself as Betty Elms, a young, innocent and talented version of herself just arrived in LA from Deep River to pursue her acting career. Other individuals she has encountered in LA (including several from Camilla and Adam's party and two strangers seen in Winkie's restaurant) take on new parts in the fantasy.In the fantasy, other names are changed or switched among characters. Camilla becomes Rita (not her real name which she has conveniently forgotten but one borrowed from a Rita Hayworth poster the amnesiac happens to see). Most enigmatically, the unnamed girl kissing Camilla at Adam's party (Melissa George), Camilla's new lover and replacement for Dianne, becomes 'Camilla Rhodes' in the fantasy. The choice of the name fits with Diane's anger and jealousy at the girl and anger with Camilla, who has dumped her.The film, and the fantasy, begin with Diane's alter ego Betty arriving in LA and encountering 'Rita' = Camilla (Laura Elena Harring), a beautiful amnesiac car accident victim who conveniently has wandered into the apartment where Betty is staying. The imaginary accident site and chauffeured limo are identical to the real site where Diane and Camilla exited the vehicle to take a shortcut to Adam's hillside mansion for the party. Betty helps Rita investigate who she is and, also conveniently, Rita soon falls in love with Betty. In the course of their investigations, Betty and Rita discover a blond female suicide. Diane's fantasy includes some self-serving and gratuitous nudity by Rita (really the object of her obsession, Camilla Rhodes). Also gratuitously, Rita dons a blonde wig and makeup that morph her appearance towards that of Betty's.Related side-plots in Diane's fantasy conform to both her wishful and also her dark view of her world (herself as the hero, confronting a variety of bad people and saving a beautiful damsel in distress): Betty has an audition and performs brilliantly, briefly encounters director Adam Kesher with whom she makes an instant positive connection, mafia types and a menacing cowboy pressure Kesher to cast 'Camilla Rhodes' (not the real Camilla but the unnamed kissing girl from the party) in a part for which she is not qualified - the girl unfairly get's Betty's part. This last element fits with Diane's jealousy over kissing girl's replacing her as the real Camilla Rhodes' lover.In other vignette elements of Diane's fantasy, Joe the hit-man spectacularly and elaborately bungles a job, reflecting Diane's heterophobia, Kesher's spoiled wife Lorraine is having an affair with the pool cleaner Gene, and significantly a large stylized blue key appears as an evil sign. Reality intrudes into Diane's dream in the form of the symbolic big blue key, 'Diane' on a waitress's name tag at Winkie's, and most significantly the performance at Club Silencio in which Betty, terrified, is forced to confront reality. At this point Diane wakes up and the film flips to reality.Finally, the detectives are knocking at the door and Diane, overwhelmed by her situation (madness taking her, her fantasy a fiction, her lover dead, incarceration imminent), kills herself on her bed using a revolver - matching the pose and clothing of the blonde suicide discovered by her imaginary characters Betty and Rita."

"Five best friends in their late 20s face the disintegration of their tightknit urban tribe. A colorful mishmash of gay, straight, white, brown, funny, smart people, this group lives and breathes New York City with a vivid emotional realism that captures the tenor of a new generation. As the war in Iraq smolders in the background, these melancholy if amusing young adults suffer from, as loner Felix puts it: ""a touch of existential malaise courtesy of late capitalism - you know, the usual.""Andrew, Felix, Tony, Julie and Ben bond as fast friends while attending a small liberal arts college. After graduation, they move to New York and the group friendship endures. We meet them again, seven years later, as Andrew and Julie announce their engagement. While this is welcome and expected news, the official coupling signals the beginning of the end: the utopian bubble of group love must burst!For the first time the group entertains an outsider: the older, charismatic Louie, who dazzles and amuses them with his aura of grown-up success and power and with his unabashed vulgarity. Streetwise, sexy and Machiavellian, Louie circles the group, briefly joins it, and forever changes its chemistry. When he makes a tempting business proposal, alpha-male Andrew the most ambitious and impatient of the lot cannot resist. Louie meanwhile casts a keen eye on Andrews fiancée, Julie.What begins as a simple business proposal creates a rift between Andrew and the others. As their lives play out in overlapping storylines, each character searches for some deeper connection thats just out of grasp: for court jester Ben, its secret sex with other men; for Tony, a commitment to love; for Felix, the easy escape of drugs and the casual sex they inspire; and for Julie, the struggle to make sense of her own desire as the only woman in this chorus of confused men (most of whom, it seems, desire her). As for alpha-male Andrew? He wants it all, of course, and must therefore lose it all.A debauched bachelor party orchestrated by Louie sets the scene for the groups final moment. Absurd, sad, funny and ultimately heartrending, the climactic party opens the door for some surprising new futures for all of the characters. As in life, the net result is a mixed bag: sweet and sour, happy and sad, and hopeful. The group bond may be a thing of the past, but some friendships last.Centers on five attractive college friends--gay and straight--in New York City. About to enter new life stages, each seeks some kind of connection. Ben cruises for guys online while Tony looks for commitment from his handsome professor boyfriend Robert. No matter how rewarding or difficult (and everything in between) life is for these almost-thirtysomethings, they can always rely on the strong bonds of friendship. [D-Man2010]

"The movie opens with a shot of Nelson (Kiefer Sutherland), a medical student, saying, ""Today is a good day to die."" The movie then moves on to explain this statement as Nelson tries to convince Joe Hurley (William Baldwin), David Labraccio (Kevin Bacon), Randy Steckle (Oliver Platt), and Rachel Manus (Julia Roberts), four of his classmates, to help him conduct a dangerous experiment: Nelson wishes to experience clinical death for one minute before being brought back to life by emergency measures, saying he wants to see if there is anything beyond death. Nelson's classmates are extremely apprehensive about the idea, but after much arguing, the five students decide to go ahead with the experiment. Nelson is then ""flatlined,"" and his experience in the ""afterlife"" is interspersed on-screen with his classmates' attempts to bring him back to life. Despite some difficulty, they are able to successfully resuscitate him. Describing later what he felt, Nelson says, ""You can't break it down into specifics, but there is something there. It's comforting.""The success of the experiment prompts the others to do the same, each for their own reasons. Joe goes next, looking for little more than fame, and agrees with Nelson that there is post-death activity. David then argues that, as the atheist in the group and the experiment's control, he should go next. After David also experiences things that he cannot ascribe to his previous scientific viewpoint, Rachel insists on being the next one to be put under.Almost immediately after each experiment, however, each participant starts to experience strange phenomena. Nelson sees his injured dog Champ and a little boy, who quickly progress from just appearing before him to stalking and assaulting him. Joe, an out of control playboy despite being engaged, starts seeing visions in TV sets of women whom he secretly videotaped while having sex with them. On a subway train, David suddenly sees a little girl who calls his name, insults him with schoolyard taunts, and then disappears. Nelson and Joe remain silent about what has happened to them, but during Rachel's experiment, David speaks up about his strange experiences. Eventually, he convinces the others to abort Rachel's experiment, but an electrical short almost prevents them from bringing her back.David then explains what is happening to him: he remembers the little girl that is appearing to him as a girl that he bullied in school named Winnie Hicks (Kimberly Scott). This prompts Joe to speak up about his experiences as well. David then prods Nelson to do the same. Nelson complies and identifies his assailant as Billy Mahoney (Joshua Rudoy), a kid he used to pick on, but his description of the injuries to his face get Randy's attention, as that cannot be mere hallucination. Randy argues that what the others have said is impossible, but Nelson replies that they have experienced death and are, therefore, in uncharted territory. Nelson asserts, ""Somehow we brought our sins back physically,... and they're pissed."" David and the others then chastise Nelson for not speaking up sooner, as that equated to an unethical withholding of findings.The team then moves on to dealing with what they have unleashed. After getting surrounded by ghosts of women using the same vacuous pickup lines on him that he used on them, Joe finds his fiancée Anne (Hope Davis) in his apartment. She reveals that she found his videotapes, and she is therefore leaving him; not for cheating on her, but for so cruelly violating the trust of so many women. Rachel is haunted by visions of her father, who committed suicide when she was five. Nelson attempts to confront Billy Mahoney head-on, only to be beaten down once again.David, trying a different approach, finds where the adult Winnie Hicks, now a mother and wife, is currently living, and, accompanied by Nelson, drives out to ask for her forgiveness, hoping it will resolve David's long-time guilt and make his hallucinations disappear. At first Winnie tries to be polite, but she reveals that she has tried to forget about what happened when they were children, and she does not appreciate David coming and reopening those wounds. David continues trying to apologize, but, realizing that he is now just making the situation worse, he leaves. As he is going, though, Winnie calls to him, and with a tear in her eye, says, ""Thank you."" While this is happening, Nelson, who was waiting in the car, is once more attacked by Billy Mahoney. When David arrives, all he sees is Nelson alone on the floor struggling, and he snaps a terrified Nelson out of it.When Nelson and David get back to town, Rachel, who saw another vision of her father in class, reveals to the others what is happening to her and sarcastically thanks Nelson for the ""nightmare."" An argument between the five then erupts. David finally calms everyone down and goes to take care of Rachel while instructing Joe and Randy to help Nelson find Billy Mahoney. David tries to console Rachel, and they eventually make love off-screen.Nelson takes Randy and Joe to a cemetery. It is explained, through a flashback, that Nelson accidentally killed Billy (and fatally injured his dog Champ at the same time) while bullying him in school. Nelson becomes angry, screaming at the tombstone, ""I thought I paid my dues!"" since Nelson's life was ruined after the incident, at which he was separated from his family. He then says that David is right, that he can still make amends. Nelson gets in the car and drives off alone. Joe and Randy, having been stranded by Nelson, call David. David rushes out to pick them up, and they figure out what Nelson's plan is.Meanwhile, Rachel, now alone, finally confronts her father and sees the truth of what happened when she was a child: though she blamed herself all these years for his death, he was actually addicted to heroin. Rachel and her father then have a tearful reconciliation which is interrupted when Nelson calls, apologizing for getting them all involved in the situation. He also admits to Rachel that he is going under one last time committing suicide by himself. Nelson rushes to the laboratory where the group has been conducting their experiments, injects himself with potassium, and dies. The others all show up moments later and try to resuscitate Nelson to no avail.Meanwhile, in the afterworld, Nelson appears, first young and then old, switching places with Billy Mahoney; being killed as Billy was knocked out of a tree. Finally, after twelve minutes, the team gives up and lets Nelson go. While talking over Nelson's dead body, Rachel says that Nelson told her on the phone that he thought he deserved to die. David angrily disagrees, saying Nelson was just a child who had made a mistake. David puts the defibrillator paddles to Nelson again, and in the afterworld, Nelson suddenly gets up and is faced by a now smiling Billy. He waves goodbye and walks off with Champ into the light as Nelson, hearing voices calling to him, runs the other way. Back on the table, the group has successfully brought Nelson back to life. Nelson then whispers in David's ear, ""It wasn't such a good day to die,"" and thanks them.
NOTE: The film's depiction of cardiopulmonary resuscitation is commonly regarded as inaccurate. While defibrillation is of no use if a patient has truly flatlined, it is possible for a patient to be in ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, and still be revived with use of paddles.(as per Wikipedia)"

"Erika Kohut (Isabelle Huppert) is a piano professor at a Vienna music conservatory. Although already in her forties, she still lives in an apartment with her domineering mother (Annie Girardot); her father is a long-standing resident in a lunatic asylum. Throughout the film, the audience is gradually shown truths about Erika's private life. Behind her assured façade, she is a woman whose sexual repression verges into full-fledged desperation and is manifested in a long list of paraphilias, including (but by no means limited to) voyeurism and sadomasochistic fetishes such as sexual self-mutilation.Upon meeting Walter Klemmer (Benoît Magimel), a charming 17-year-old engineering student from a bourgeois background, they begin to obsess one another. Even though she initially attempts to prevent consistent contact and even tries to undermine his application to the conservatory, he eventually becomes her pupil. Like her, he appreciates and is a gifted (if distinct) interpreter of Schumann and Schubert.She destroys the musical prospects of an insecure but talented girl, Anna Schober, driven by her jealousy of the girl's contact with Walter -- and also, perhaps, by her fears that Anna's life will mirror her own. She does so by hiding shards of glass inside one of her coat pockets, permanently damaging Anna's hands and ruining her aspirations to play at the forthcoming jubilee concert. Erika is then wholly sympathetic when the girl's mother (Susanne Lothar) asks for advice on her daughter's recuperation. (The sub-plot of the pupil and her mother, mirroring the main relationship in the film, is absent in Jelinek's novel.) In what clearly qualifies, at that point of the film, as dramatic irony, the girl's mother rhetorically asks Erika who could do something so evil.Walter is increasingly insistent in his desire to start a relationship with her. But when she finally acquiesces, Walter is unwilling to indulge her violent fantasies, which repulse him. The film climaxes, however, when he finally does. He attacks her in her apartment in the fashion she let him know she desired, violently raping her as she lies prostrate after receiving a beating from him. She discovers, finally, that the reality of her desires does not match her conception of them.Shortly thereafter, minutes before the concert in which she is supposed to fill in for Anna, Erika tries to enact some speculable form of revenge or call of attention on Walter, and when confronted with his hypocritical, smug indifference she puts a knife into herself and promptly leaves the auditorium. Her onscreen injury is not severe, but the implications of the whole ending scene leave it clear to the audience that more serious self-inflicted harm is a matter of course."

"ACT I: ""Men and Maggots""In June of 1905, the armored battle ship Potemkin is near Odessa on the Black Sea returning after Russia's defeat in the Russo-Japanese war.We see many sailors asleep in their gently swaying hammocks. A petty officer walks checking the dormitory. A young sailor sleeps with a shoulder and arm hanging outside his hammock. This inconveniences the movements of the officer, and he reacts by whipping the young man. A few of the other sailors wake up and observe this act.In the morning, the ship's cook has hung large pieces of beef just outside the kitchen. We see ordinary sailors talking to each other, pointing to the meat, and calling others to look.An officer on a railing higher up notices the unusual gathering, and the sailors convey to him that the meat is disgusting.The officer eventually calls the ship's doctor, who goes down to get a close look at the meat. The ship's doctor, whose demeanor is that of a servile sycophant, after looking carefully through his pince-nez, says the meat is not rotten, as it has no worms but only maggots, and those can be washed out with brine.We see preparations to serve a meal on table tops that are swinging because they hang from ropes in the ceiling. Large steel bowls are put on the tables and soup is served as the only food. Some of the sailors do not eat the soup.Later, we see in the kitchen the washing up of dishes after the meal. One of the items washed is a dish that has an inscription around near the border. The inscription reads: Give Us This Day our Daily Bread. The dishwasher holds the dish for a moment, reads it again and shows it, and smashes it. The washing crew abandons the work station.Later, we see many sailors buying cans of food and other provisions at a porthole, evidently a canteen. An officer walks by, glares at the sailors, who stand motionless and glare back. At one point, in talk occurring below decks, sailor Vakulinchuk (Aleksandr Antonov) says they are being treated worse than the Russians in Japanese POW camps.Other sailors complain about unbearable conditions, of being treated contemptuously by pompous officers and there is talk about doing something about it.ACT II: ""Drama at the Harbour""Soon after next light, all hands are called on deck. Everyone lines up. Captain Golikov (Vladimir Barsky) comes up from a trap entrance and yells that no disobedience or strike will be tolerated, and he will hang everyone in the ship if he is disobeyed. Sailors look up at the masts and imagine bodies hanging from the horizontals.The Captain then orders all those who ate the borsch made with the meat to step under the cannons in a show of loyalty.Most of the sailors move under the cannons, but a group of about fifteen do not.The captain proceeds to inform those who did not eat the soup that he will kill them. The group tries to go below decks through the captain's trap entrance, but officers push them back. Upon the captain's orders, a tarpaulin is thrown over them, to make it psychologically easier for others to shoot.The ship's Orthodox priest makes an appearance on an upper deck, calling the disobedient to repent, and holding a golden cross high. Under the tarpaulin, some sailors get on their knees.The captain orders a shooting squad of marines to advance and get in position to shoot at the tarpaulin. When the captain finally gives the order to fire, there is hesitation, and the moment is seized by ordinary seaman Vakulinchuk, who intervenes to save the men by appealing to the firing squad to ignore their orders.The marines still do not shoot. Everyone looks at each other for a while. Vakulinchuk jumps on the guns and continues to speak. Vakulinchuk implores his shipmates to rise up against those who oppress them, namely the officers of the ship. The captain repeats the order, but it is not followed. Instead, Vakulinchuk persuades the rank and file to riot and turn on the officers.There are dramatic scrambles and running and taking cover and pursuits below deck to grab rifles, but since the rifles are in the hands of the rank and file, there isn't much shooting. The resisting officers are beaten and thrown overboard to drown, including the doctor.The ship's priest, whose appearance is suggestive of Rasputin, gets pushed down a ladder and pretends to be dead.Before being thrown overboard, one of the officers manages to grab a gun, pursues Vakulinchuk and shoots him from the back, hitting the head. Vakulinchuk then manages to put his hand up and touch his head wound, then falls from high into a tackle and writhes for a while before he tumbles down into the water.By then, all the commanding officers are overboard and the ship is under mutineer control. There are shouts to save Vakulinchuk, several sailors jump into the water and get to him, but he is brought on deck already dead.The mutineers feel bonded by their common the struggle, and the motto All for One and its counterpart One for All is shouted around.There is a shot of the doctor's pince-nez hanging delicately from a side rope. It was the pince-nez used as a magnifying glass through which the wriggling maggots had been seen in close up.ACT III: ""A Dead Man Calls for Justice""The Potemkin sails under the mutineers' control to dock at the port of Odessa. The body of Vakulinchuk is taken to the shore to lie in state, under a tent improvised on the pier, holding a candle and with a sign on his chest reading ""KILLED FOR A BOWL OF SOUP""First he is looked at by a few curious people. Some old women look and pray briefly. But the word gets around, more and more people come filing past his remains, and little by little enormously long columns of mourners pass by, coming across bridges and down stairways and making long queues on breakwaters..The locals gather in spontaneous groups to talk about the events, and clearly there is seething political ferment against the tsarist régime, although a few voice contempt for the mutineers.As a sneering member of the bourgeoisie heckles a woman protester, the reaction shot of a man turning around shows anger and has an element of threat.During another heated discussion, someone in the crowd on shore says,""Kill the Jews!""But the bulk of the citizens of Odessa, after filing past Vakulinchuk, get all whipped up and vow to destroy the oppressors and help the mutineers. There are close-up shots of the clenching fists of the hundreds of spectators who are fed up with the régime.Large numbers of small sail craft approach the battleship to support the crew, bringing food supplies and live fowl in cages and live pigs.ACT IV: ""The Odessa Staircase""A great many of the townspeople have gathered on the long and wide flights of stairs overlooking the harbor, leading down towards the piers. They are in a good mood and often shouting encouragement towards the ship. Men, women, and children of all ages have come to see what is happening.Without warning, troops in white tunics appear at the top of the stairs, rifles pointing horizontally, and slowly march down the steps. For a few seconds, people scramble away, downwards and to the sides, including a man without legs and another on crutches. Then the soldiers open fire, indiscriminately, against everyone, unarmed men, women, children, and the aged.Dozens and dozens of people scramble downwards and towards the side. Aged people cower behind low walls. The soldiers keep marching down and firing aiming carefully, as they shoot down against the fleeing.A woman carries her dead son's body in her arms, upwards towards the shooters, expecting them to let her pass. She stops a few steps in front of them, says ""My son is very ill"" but a second later she is shot. People look onto the sight, horrified.People stampede over others who have fallen, dead or alive. We see a military boot stepping on the wrist of a child.We see someone wearing glasses with a frightened look, and then the same glasses on the floor broken by a bullet that passed through one lens.The victims include a mother who is pushing a baby in a baby carriage. As she falls to the ground, dying, she leans against the carriage, nudging it away. It rolls down the steps amidst the fleeing crowd. Desperate onlookers watch the seemingly endless journey of the pram rolling down unchecked.Cossacks on horseback then arrive from the pier side, and slaughter the helpless people from the bottom of the stairway with saber cuts.ACT V:""The Rendez-Vous with a Squadron""The crew on the Potemkin goes into battle stations, and turns its guns on the town, shooting against buildings where Tsarist soldiers might be concentrated. By then the carnage on the stairs stops, as only soldiers remain standing there.The crew of the Potemkin then puts out to sea to avoid an attack from the shore.A squadron of warships is steaming towards Odessa to retake the Potemkin.The crew on board the Potemkin expects this. They leave many on sentry duty and most others try to sleep. When multiple ships are sighted far away on the horizon, they take up steam and move to meet them on the open sea while everyone who was sleeping wakes and goes to battle stations.As the ships come nearer, the Potemkin is sending light and flag signals calling on the other side's crews to treat them as brothers.The barrels of numerous cannons are ominously leveled towards the outnumbered battleship Potemkin, but at the moment when the ships come into range, their crews allow the mutineers to pass through.The crew of the Potemkin rejoices, and rank and file from the squadron come to the deck rails, waving in friendship and brotherhood as the ships pass traveling in opposite directions."
"In the midst of the Russian Revolution of 1905, the crew of the battleship Potemkin mutiny against the brutal, tyrannical regime of the vessel's officers. The resulting street demonstration in Odessa brings on a police massacre.::Kenneth Chisholm"
Based on the historical events the movie tells the story of a riot at the battleship Potemkin. What started as a protest strike when the crew was given rotten meat for dinner ended in a riot. The sailors raised the red flag and tried to ignite the revolution in their home port Odessa.::Konstantin Dlutskii <ked@falcon.cc.ukans.edu>
"1905. There is a general feeling of revolution amongst the Russian populace against the Imperial rulers. This feeling is slow to reach the crew of the battleship, Potemkin. However, the crew eventually does rebel against their Imperial ruled officers for what they see as the poor conditions aboard, namely the provision of maggot infested rotting meat as their food. This mini-revolution on board leads to a confrontation between the officers and crew. News of the result of this confrontation hits the streets of Odessa as the Potemkin sails into port. The fight on board the Potemkin makes its way to the streets of Odessa as civilians want to show their support for their brothers on board. This situation leads to further actions by the Imperial army, both against the Russian civilians in Odessa as well as against the Potemkin crew.::Huggo"
"Based on actual events that occurred at the port of Odessa in 1905, the crew of the battleship Potemkin mutiny after yet again being served rotten food.

Things look grim for the crew.::grantss"
"The sea is rough and on the battleship Potemkin the multitude of men on deck finds worms in the rotten meat. The sailors refuse to shoot who did not want to eat the rotten meat. On the deck of the ship there is a revolt against the officers. A sailor,Vakulinchuk, that he was the first to invoke the revolt, is shot by an officer, remains hanging on a rope and a group of officers goes to rescue him. A group of sailors approaches Odessa, bringing even the dying sailor with the inscription ""killed for a plate of soup"". The inhabitants of Odessa run down the stairs to see the dead sailor. A very long field with a frame from the top connects the flow of people on the stairs with the waves of the sea. A young man reads a letter that incites the revolt to avenge the sailor and alternates in the assembling moved close-ups. With the motto ""All for one and one for all"" collective despair becomes union. In a very long field the crowd of people goes under and over a bridge. Cossacks arrive and shoot men, women and children on the crowd. A mother goes to meet the Cossacks with her dead son in her arms. Another mother is killed and the caravan with the little child goes down the stairs. The city of Odessa is bombed by Potemkin, which tries to stop the massacre. In the darkness the armored Potemkin advances towards a ship sent by the tsar and get ready for the fight. The fleet sent by the tsar does not open fire and all shout to the brotherhood.::luigicavaliere"

"At the New York School for Performing Arts, a group of teens and young adults audition and are admitted to achieve their goal of 'fame'. Opening at the auditions, seven very different young people are chosen to be accepted into the academy. They include: drama student Doris Finsecker (Maureen Teefy) who longs to be a famous actress on stage and screen; drama student Ralph 'Raul' Garcia (Barry Miller) who longs to have a career on stage; multi-talented Coco Hernandez (Irene Cara) who longs to have a career in drama, music, and dance; Leroy Johnson (Gene Anthony Ray) a troubled youth from a rough crime-ridden neighborhood who longs to be a dancer; Montgomery MacNeil (Paul McCrane) another drama student who longs to be a world-famous actor; Bruno Martelli (Lee Curreri) a music student seeking to make it big; and Lisa Monroe (Laura Dean) another dance student.During the auditions, several of the teachers are also introduced. They include the music teacher Mr. Shorofsky (Albert Hague); English and reading teacher Mrs. Sherwood (Anne Meara); dance and ballet teacher Miss Berg (Joanna Merlin); drama teacher Mr. Farrel (Jim Moody); and dance teacher and former dancer Ms. Grant (Debbie Allen).The movie then spans four years among the students and teachers lives told as four seperate consecutive 30-35 minute episodes each spaning over several months.FRESHMAN YEARThe new students learn on the first day of classes that academics are weighted equally with performance. Leroy clashes with Mrs. Sherwood in English class over his reluntance to learn every new topic.The naive and innocent Doris is overwhelmed by the energy and spontaneity in the lunchroom and flees, meeting Montgomery. Doris and Montgomery become friends, and Doris worries that she's too ordinary against the colorful personalities of the other students.As the year progresses, Coco tries to convince Bruno to book performing gigs with her. During a night on the town, Coco tells Bruno of her belief that she's ""doing my last dance on this dark little planet"" so it has to be spectacular.Leroy and Mrs. Sherwood continue to clash over Leroy's refusal to do homework. It is eventually revealed to the viewers that Leroy is illiterate and is also too ashamed to admit it to anyone.Meanwhile, Bruno and his working-class taxi driver father (Eddie Barth) argue over Bruno's reluctance to play his music publicly over his stage fright.One day in ballet class, Miss Berg warns Lisa she is not working hard enough.Graduating senior Michael (Boyd Gaines) wins a prestigious scholarship and before he leaves the academy, he tells Doris that the William Morris Agency wants to send him out for auditions for television pilots.SOPHOMORE YEARHilary van Doren (Antonia Franceschi) joins the school, and she and Coco clash over Leroy over both wanting to date both of them. Hilary seduces Leroy and learns his secret of being unable to read.Meanwhile, Bruno and Mr. Shorofsky debate the merits of traditional orchestras versus synthesized instruments.One day in drama class, as an acting exercise, Mr. Farrell has the students to try to divulge a painful memory. Ralph tells of learning about the death of Freddie Prinze. Doris relates her humiliation at being forced by her demanding and pushy stage actress mother to sing at a child's birthday party. Montgomery discusses discovering his homosexuality, and in the process comes out to the whole school, for which he is teased by Ralph wearing 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show' style drag.Meanwhile, Bruno's father continues to try to encourage his son to play his music and he plays Bruno's own music (the title song 'Fame') outside the school, inspiring the student body to dance in the streets and Coco to sing the song.A few weeks later, Miss Berg drops Lisa from the dance program. Lisa, after seemingly considering suicide by jumping in front of a moving subway train over her fear of being expelled from the school, instead drops her dance clothes on the subway tracks and declares: ""Fuck it! If I can't dance, I'll change to the drama department.""JUNIOR YEARA few months later, Ralph and Doris discover their mutual attraction, but their growing intimacy leaves Montgomery feeling excluded.Meanwhile, Hilary brings Leroy home to shock her conservative father and stepmother over her dating this tough punk.One evening, Ralph's young sister is attacked by a junkie and Ralph lashes out at his insanely religious mother's attempts to comfort the severly injured child by taking her to the local Catholic church, instead of to a hospital.Doris also begins to question her Jewish upbringing, changing her name to ""Dominique DuPont."" One evening, she and Ralph attend a screening of 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show' at the 8th Street Playhouse, and during the ""Time Warp"" Doris rips off her blouse and joins the stage show. She becomes giddy the next day as she realizes that as an actress she can put on any personality she wants, but is sobered upon running into Michael, whom is not working, but struggling as an actor and waiting tables at a local restaurant.SENIOR YEARAnother few months later, Ralph follows in the footsteps of his idol Freddie Prinze and performs stand-up comedy at Catch a Rising Star and garners some initial success. He falls into a hard-party lifestyle and strains his relationship with Doris. Given a prime spot at a comedy club, he bombs after clashing with both Doris and Montgomery over his new lifestyle. Disgusted with himself, he believes his career is over, but Montgomery comforts him by telling him that his failing is part of the entertainment business.Meanwhile, Hilary is offered a spot with the San Francisco Ballet. But her chances might be jepordized when she learns that she is pregnant by Leroy. Desperate to take the spot, Hilary has an abortion.Elsewhere, Coco is approached in a diner by a sleazy guy (Steve Inwood) claiming to be a director. She goes to his apartment for a ""screen test"" and he forces her to undress in front of the camera.Leroy is offered a spot in Alvin Ailey's dance company, but to be accepted he must graduate as he continues to struggle with his illiteracy. He finds out that Mrs. Sherwood has not passed his final exam and becomes very angry. He finds Mrs. Sherwood at a local hospital while she's sitting outside her husband's hospital room while he is recovering from an apparent heart attack. Leroy lashes out at her for failing him. She lashes back and, chagrined, he comforts her over her personal situation with her spouse.In the final scene, at the graduation cerimony, the student body all comes together to perform the finalé, ""I Sing the Body Electric"". The opening lines are sung by Lisa, Coco, and Montgomery.

Mahmut is a successful commercial photographer and his ordered life is disrupted by the presence of his cousin and this exacerbates his concern with his ex-wife Nazan (Zuhal Gencer Erkaya) who has remarried and is leaving to live in Canada with her new husband.

After his wife leaves him, he falls into an existential crisis. Then comes his cousin Yusuf, who left his native village after a local factory closed down, effectively unemploying over half the local men. He looks to Istanbul for salvation: a job on board a ship sailing abroad, at once exciting and crucial to supporting his family in the desperately poor village. The distance between the two men is apparent at once, and becomes increasingly pronounced. Whereas Mahmut is adusted to big city life and suffers from many of its neuroses, Yusuf is a lonely, excentric country worker with annoying nervous and hygienic habits, and a sick mother back home he must somehow support. This intimate drama was filmed in the director's apartment in Istanbul, using all his furniture, appliances, rooms, car and so on as the film's props. The actor playing Yusuf is actually the director's real-life cousin, and the actor playing Mahmut is an actual friend, a non-professional actor.::Gonz30"

"The movie opens in the year 1977 in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles. Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds), a film director, and Amber Waves (Julianne Moore), his part-time girlfriend/actress, enter a club owned by Maurice Rodríguez (Luis Guzmán). Maurice then meets fellow actors Buck Swope (Don Cheadle) and Reed Rothchild (John C. Reilly). Jack and Amber are also met by Rollergirl (Heather Graham) a teenage actress who always wears roller skates. We also see Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg), a busboy, whom Jack watches with interest. Finally, producer William 'Little Bill' Thomson (William H. Macy) arrives to fix a date for shooting a movie but Jack changes the schedule. Jack ignores Little Bill and goes to see Eddie whom is working in the kitchen. Eddie thinks Jack wants to see him masturbate (which he does for money) but misunderstands Jack's real intentions. Jack tells Eddie he's a film director, who directs ""exotic pictures"". Jack wants to talk to him over a drink but Eddie refuses his offer by saying that he doesn't drink.Some time later, the nightclub switches off their lights. Jack goes home with Amber and fixes himself a drink. Amber snorts a small amount of cocaine and makes a phone call, wanting to speak with her son over the phone but her ex-husband Tom refuses to let her. Little Bill arrives home to find his nymphomaniac wife (Nina Hartley) having sex with a stranger - she coldly tells Little Bill to sleep on the couch. Elsewhere, Eddie goes home and shows off his ego by doing some karate moves in his underwear in front of a mirror, fancying himself as a Bruce Lee impressionist. The sizable bulge of Eddie's penis is prominent through his underwear.The next morning, Eddie's mother gets angry that he's working at a car wash at day and a nightclub at night, furious that he doesn't go to school since Eddie apparently dropped out of high school some time ago.Meanwhile, Buck Swope tries to sell a hi-fi stereo system during his day job but fails when he demonstrates the system using a country/western song that the customer finds unappealing. His manager blames him because of his ""cowboy look"".Across town, Rollergirl is at a high school taking a test but the questions seem to be confusing. A guy in class (Kai Lennox) slyly imitates fellatio, suggesting he's seen Rollergirl do the same on film. Rollergirl becomes upset and leaves the classroom and the school itself.Eddie goes to his girlfriend, Sheryl Lynn's (Laurel Holloman) house. Sheryl praises Eddie and says that he is good at sex. Her suggestion entices Eddie to join the porn industry.In the nightclub, Jack whispers something in Rollergirl's ears. Rollergirl takes Eddie in a room and unzips his pants, taken aback slightly by what she sees. She bends down to give Eddie a blowjob. Afterward, Eddie is seen walking around the street and Jack offers Eddie a ride, along with Amber and Rollergirl. Jack takes them to a diner and talks about the porn industry and his dream of making a porno film where the story & plot will ""suck them in"", rather than just be a cheap film where the sex only entices the audience to masturbate and leave the theatre. They then go to Jack's house and Jack tells Rollergirl to have sex with Eddie, an audition of sorts. She accepts and Jack watches them have sex right in front of him.Eddie returns home in the early morning and finds his mother waiting for him. She throws out torrents of verbal abuse, calling him stupid and saying he'll never amount to anything. She tears up some of the decorations in his room and he leaves horribly upset, telling her he'll be a success despite her berating of him. Eddie leaves the house in a fury and goes to Jack's house where Jack is having a poolside party and introduces Eddie to fellow porn actor Reed Rothchild. The two become instant friends. Later, the Colonel James (Robert Ridgely), a porn financier, gets out of a car with an unknown teenage girl and Jack welcomes them. Buck tries to talk to his girlfriend Becky Barnett (Nicole Ari Parker) about the previous situation at work. She suggests he change his look -- Buck becomes angry and stalks off. Maurice asks Amber to talk to Jack to let him act in a porn movie and she says that she will see what she can do. The unknown woman with the Colonel finds someone who has cocaine and decides to snort it with him. When the house phone rings, Maurice picks it up and the caller asks for Maggie. Maurice calls for a Maggie but no one seems to answer (it is Amber who is actually Maggie but she is seen snorting cocaine and is so out of it that she doesn't hear Maurice calling out her real name).Little Bill sees his wife having sex on Jack's driveway with another stranger while a crowd of men surrounds her as she seems to enjoy the attention. Little Bill walks away from it in disgust. Jack's cinematographer, Kurt (Ricky Jay), tries to talk to him about the shooting of the Jack's next film, but Little Bill, too distracted by the spectacle involving his wife, gets angry and walks away.Back at the pool party, the Colonel then sees that the teenager he was with has overdosed and asks the chauffeur to drop her off at the nearest emergency room. Scotty J. (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a boom operator, sees Eddie and it's love at first sight with him and they converse. Eddie later on is introduced to the Colonel by Jack. The Colonel looks at Eddie's penis & realizes the young man will be a huge money maker. He also suggests that Eddie think about a new name with panache. Later that night, Jack joins Reed and Eddie in his hot tub. Jack asks Eddie to pick up a screen name for his career and Eddie tells him he thought up the name 'Dirk Diggler'.On Dirk's first shooting day, Little Bill discusses the script with Jack. Jack decides that Eddie and Amber should be together in a scene. Scotty tells Eddie it is time and Eddie has a monologue and tells to himself that he's ready. Eddie goes and Jack discusses the scene; Eddie asks to be called ""Dirk"" from then on and Jack heartily agrees. Amber and Eddie also decide that he should ejaculate on her breasts. Little Bill also gives some advice to Eddie. They shoot the sex scene which involves Eddie interviewing Amber for a film role - they have sex right on top of the desk. The encounter lasts so long that the crew eventually runs out of film and they change angles. Amber tells Eddie to come inside her and tell her she's ""fixed"" (which means she's been sterilized). Afterwards, Little Bill tells Jack that they missed the ""money shot"" and could use stock footage, which Jack scoffs at, saying it won't match. Dirk tells Jack he can perform the scene again in a few minutes if they need a closeup.The crew then decides to celebrate with a wrap up party. With the money they earned from their adult film sales, Reed and Eddie buy new shirts and shoes. Eddie then dances with Rollergirl in the same nightclub that he used to work in. The Colonel is seen with a new underage teenage girl while Becky talks to a new guy. We also see Reed as a magician and perform a rising card trick to Buck. We see Eddie rise to fame as people flock to see his movies while critics praises his ""suck-cess"". Eddie is also seen disco dancing with Reed and other people and Jack reads accolades about Eddie in the porn trade papers.Some time later, Eddie reveals that he doesn't like porn that degrades woman (like John Holmes's films) and discusses a new porn series with Jack about an always-on-the-make private detective and crime fighter. Eddie decides that his character for the new porn series should be called ""Brock Landers"" while Reed will be called ""Chest Rockwell"", and they play two private detectives who fight crime, have fistfights with various bad guys, and have sex with their women or random women as their rewards (a thinly veiled version of the 'Johnny Wadd' porn series starring John Holmes, whom Eddie makes reference too). The new porn crime-noir series is immediately a box office hit, which brings in more money for Jack and his crew. Eddie also wins three awards at the 2nd Annual Adult Film Awards in Las Vegas: Best Newcomer, Best Cock and Best Actor. He promises that he will make better movies.The movie then flashes forward to 1978. We see a clip from the newest Brock Landers movie, Brock Landers: Angels Live In My Town (based on the Johnny Wadd film China Cat). Jack tells his editor to make some changes. Eddie then takes Amber around his new house and we see an extensive wardrobe and his most favorite possession: an orange 1977 Chevrolet Corvette. We also see a porn actress Jessie St. Vincent (Melora Walters) drawing a portrait of him. Jack produces more of the Brock Landers series. Eddie wins more statues from the Adult Film Awards.December 31, 1979 - New Year's Eve. Becky meets a new guy named Jerome (Michael Jace). Floyd Gondolli (Philip Baker Hall) meets the Colonel in Jack's New Year's Eve party and introduces his new porn actors. Amber interrupts Jessie and Eddie and Jessie decides to talk to Buck, who feels lonely, his latest ""look"" a Rick James outfit, is a failure. Todd Parker (Thomas Jane), an exotic male dancer shows up at Jack's party and talks to Reed. Buck tells Jessie all about what he wants to do. Amber asks Eddie to snort a line of cocaine and he readily agrees to do so. Eddie asks if he looks sexy snorting cocaine and Amber kisses him. Floyd privately talks to Jack and asks him to switch to videotape and tells him it's the ""future"". Gondolli also tells Jack that he has the connections in distribution that can make Jack a lot of money. Jack argues with him and refuses to accept Gondolli's offer, stating that the purity of film is his medium and he won't give it up. Scotty shows Eddie his new car, which happens to be an orange Datsun. To show his infatuation, Scotty kisses Eddie but Eddie becomes upset, telling Scotty he's not gay. Eddie leaves after Scotty apologizes. Scotty starts crying in his car and realizes that he did something stupid. Little Bill searches the party and finds his wife in a bedroom having sex with yet another man. Embarrassed, he goes to his car and retrieves a revolver. As the countdown to New Year nears, Little Bill kills his wife and her latest partner in cold blood and shoots himself in front of everyone.Flashing forward to 1981, a documentary on Dirk/Eddie is being shown. Dirk explains how he disregards the violence in his films, which he'd originally wanted to avoid when he dreamed up the Brock Landers character, while the narrator (Amber) tries to espouse his credibility. Reed also shares his interests on what he decides to do in the future. Rollergirl also shows Eddie's credibility by praising him. Eddie then talks about how people have written & thanked him for his work and also on what Jack does. We then see that it is Amber who has made the documentary while Eddie watches it and thanks her for it. A few minutes later, Jack's telephone rings and Jack picks it up, and realizes it's the Colonel. The Colonel is smiling while we realize that he's in prison. The Colonel tells the whole situation: he had brought a 15-year-old girl to his house and she died from a drug overdose. He tells Jack that, while the police were searching the Colonel's house following the girl's overdose, they ""found something,"" implied to be child pornography. Jack realizes the pedophile that the Colonel really is, and refuses to talk to him anymore. Jack leaves the Colonel behind refusing to hire him a lawyer or to do business with him again. We later see Jack walking through a warehouse where videotapes of pornography fill the shelves and are distributed, indicating that with the Colonel out of the picture, Jack had to accept the deal from Floyd Gondolli. Jack seems bored with the new format, which allows films to be shot simply for the sexual content involved and not for acting or story.December 1982. Becky Barnett marries Jerome (the same guy during the after-shoot party). During the wedding party, the strung-out Eddie sees Jack with a new porn actor named Johnny Doe (Jonathan Quint) as Jack tries to recruit him. Eddie gets angry and jealous over the new talent and leaves.January 1983. By this time, Eddie/Dirk has developed a heavy addiction to cocaine with Reed and Todd Parker. While high, Eddie sees Amber talking to Johnny and becomes jealous. He tries to get an erection but his addiction to coke prevents it. When he does get an erection, he marches out to the movie set and demands that Jack shoot him immediately. Jack tells Eddie to wait about 20 minutes while they prep the scene. The strung-out Eddie becomes furious, shouting obscenities and saying he's the star and nobody tells him what to do. He also tries to attack Johnny, but when Jack tries to stop him, Eddie tries to attack Jack as well. A shouting match ensues and Eddie walks off the set saying that he doesn't need them.March 1983. At Sound City Recording Studios, Eddie is trying to pursue a singing career and, with Reed, is recording a song. Eddie, however, is not a talented singer. We see the rise of Johnny Doe's career as well.Meanwhile, Rollergirl and Amber snort cocaine at Jack's house. Rollergirl decides to attain the GED (General Educational Development) and to graduate from high school. Amber says that she misses her two sons (one being Dirk) while Rollergirl calls Amber 'Mom'.Todd supplies himself, Reed and Eddie with cocaine. Reed and Eddie go to Sound City to get their tapes to take to the record company but are refused until they pay the fee for the recording time. Eddie and Reed argue with the studio's owner, saying they can't pay him until they take the demo tapes to the record company and get paid. The owner still refuses to release the tapes without payment.Elsewhere, Buck and Jessie, who are now married, decide to get a bank loan because Buck wants to start his own business of selling stereo equipment. However, they do not get the loan since they both ""endorse"" pornography as they are both former porn actors and the bank doesn't want to tarnish its own reputation.September 1983. Amber is seen in a custody battle with her ex-husband but the court determines she is an unfit mother due to her continuing involvement in the porn industry, her prior criminal record and her addiction to cocaine. Amber is later seen crying in front of the courthouse.December 11, 1983. Jack tries to revitalize his career by starting a new porn show called ""On The Lookout"". It is an early TV reality series that involves Rollergirl riding with him in a limousine while they search for random men to have sex with her so that they can videotape it. Jack picks up a college kid on the street who turns out to be Rollergirl's former high school classmate (the same one that made the obscene gesture in class that made her quit school). He later insults Rollergirl by shamelessly abusing her. Jack tells him to leave and the guy tells Jack his movies aren't good anymore. Jack is angered and starts to beat the guy up and throws him out of the limo. Rollergirl also viciously stomps on the guy with her roller skates before getting back into the limo and riding off.That same night, Dirk/Eddie is then picked up by a stranger named Joe (Channon Roe) who asks him to jerk off for ten dollars. Eddie accepts Joe's offer. Eddie tries to masturbate but cannot do so because he's still strung out on cocaine and can't ""get it up"". Suddenly, a car containing several gang members drives up; they are Joe's friends and they begin beating Eddie heavily in a homophobic assault. Joe joins in on the beating claiming that he entrapped Eddie for the sole purpose to target a ""fag"" like him. The gang quickly withdraws, leaving the bloodied Eddie on the side of the road.Jack's limo passes Buck and Jessie (who is now seven or eight months pregnant), who pull into an all-night donut shop. Buck goes to purchase some donuts. Suddenly, a thief bursts in and robs the shop at gunpoint. While the clerk packs the money from the cash register and the safe, another customer dressed like a cowboy slowly pulls a large pistol and shoots the robber. As he falls, the robber shoots the customer, who is also hit. As the armed customer pitches forward, he shoots again, hitting the clerk in the head. The clerk's blood splatters on Buck, who is unharmed. Looking at the floor, the shaken Buck sees the bag of money dropped by the robber. Seeing that no one else is there and no security cameras around, Buck takes the money and runs out.Long Way Down (One Last Thing).Flashing forward to a few months later in 1984, Eddie and his friends are desperate for money. Todd decides to steal cash from a wealthy drug dealer named Rahad Jackson (Alfred Molina) (the character is inspired by real-life gangster Eddie Nash). They decide to try to fool him by selling him a half-kilogram of baking soda disguised as cocaine for $5,000. Todd also shows the guys that he's carrying a gun, in case things go awry.That evening, Dirk, Rick, and Todd arrive at Rahad's house where the strung-out and debauched Rahad openly welcomes them and buys the cocaine while a bodyguard measures it. Rahad is also listening to 'Sister Christian' by Night Ranger as Rahad shares his opinion on track lists. Reed and Dirk want to count the money in the car but Todd refuses to listen to them. Rahad then listens to Rick Springfield's 'Jessie's Girl' as he sings along. Reed and Dirk decide they don't to wait around any longer before the gig is up and ask Todd to leave with them. Suddenly, Todd demands Rahad give them whatever is in the safe in the bedroom. When Todd points the gun, Rahad shoots Todd in the shoulder. Todd shoots back and kills the bodyguard. Rahad retreats to his bedroom. When Todd kicks the door open, Rahad kills him with a shotgun blast and chases Reed and Dirk out of his house trying to shoot them as well. Dirk speeds away in his Corvette while Reed runs off on foot. Dirk runs out of gas and is forced to stop in an unfamiliar neighborhood.Early the next morning, Dirk/Eddie turns up at Jack's house after the frightening experience. He apologizes to Jack for their previous falling out and is forgiven. Eddie is still terrified and tries to rest on Amber's lap.A few more months later, we see that Buck now has a new stereo store from the money that he stole from the botched robbery at the doughnut shop. He seems to finally have found the right ""look"" for himself, styled as an 80s rapper with Amber filming his TV ads. Rollergirl is seen taking the GED exam while the Colonel is still in prison and being beaten by his hulking cell mate. Maurice opens up a new club with his brothers (whom he briefly mentioned earlier in the film) but realizes that its sign features a spelling error. Reed pursues his role as a magician, doing what appears to be an adults-only act where his female assistant is topless. Jessie is seen giving birth to a baby boy while Buck coaches her and Scotty films it.In the final scene, we return to Jack's house several more months later. The group has become more of a family as Jack has resumed his career in the adult film industry. We follow Jack through the house. Jack tells Rollergirl to tidy her room. Reed plays with Buck's and Jessie's baby in the backyard swimming pool while Jesse paints a new portrait. Jack tells Maurice that his cooking is filling the house with unpleasant odors. Jack also argues with Buck that he wants a ""mellow"" hi-fi system. Jack then goes to Amber's room and asks her if she's ready or not for the shoot. Eventually in a bathroom, we see Dirk, dressed Miami-Vice style and practicing his lines in front of a mirror. He unzips his pants and finally reveals his flaccid penis (told to be 13 inches long when erect). He zips up and walks out of the room and goes onto a nearby room to film his latest feature."

"Adult film director Jack Horner is always on the lookout for new talent and it's only by chance that he meets Eddie Adams who is working as a busboy in a restaurant. Eddie is young, good looking and plenty of libido to spare. Using the screen name Dirk Diggler, he quickly rises to the top of his industry winning awards year after year. Drugs and ego however come between Dirk and those around him and he soon finds that fame is fleeting.::garykmcd"
"San Fernando Valley, 1977. Jack Horner is a renowned director of porn, all his movies financed by ""Colonel"" James. He has his regular stable of cast and crew, most who have issues in their lives. They include: actress Amber Waves, who acts as the mother figure to the group in the absence of being a real mother to her biological son, about who she has told no one in her porn circle; actor Reed Rothchild, who wants to live up to his on-screen alpha male status; actor Buck Swope, who works as a stereo salesman on the side and whose country & western style seems to be problematic in getting ahead; actress Rollergirl, a high school drop-out who never takes off her skates; and assistant director ""Little"" Bill, whose marriage is threatened by his wife being both a nymphomaniac and an exhibitionist. Their collective lives are punctuated by excess in everything, whether it be sex, cocaine use, or the need to amass flashy material possessions. Into their lives comes Eddie Adams, a seventeen year old high school dropout from a dysfunctional family in Torrance. Eddie, who renames himself Dirk Diggler, is Jack's latest discovery, and whose success in the industry is largely predicated on being well-endowed. Because of the validation he receives for the first time in his life, Dirk is easy prey to be sucked into the excesses of the group. Although largely an innocent beyond the few dollars previously earned here and there by showing his penis to anyone who would pay, Dirk also changes as a person as he displays more and more bravado in relation to the amount of validation he receives. The next few years lead to changes in the group, not only because of changes in technology, namely the advent of video, but as the excesses in their lives start to take their toll, and as their association with the business may affect what their post-porn life will look like.::Huggo"
"Eddie Adams would have been just another high-school drop-out had he not met the likes of adult film director Jack Horner. Horner transforms Eddie into Dirk Diggler, a rising-star actor with a special gift.

machine that is the media.He rises from his resting place and feeds upon a victim, feeling more revitalized that ever before. He then proceeds to go and find where the
music he hears is coming from, delighted to discover that it is from his old house, and
soon shows the young mortal band his talents and makes them famous, calling the rock band The Vampire Lestat. He is controversial, over the top and utterly sesuous,
portraying all the sins of the world in his lyrics and his over all demour. But unaware to
him a young member of secret vampire expert society, is in fact obsessed with him and
reads the thoughts that he put in his diary that her boss, David (Paul McGann), found. She learns of

to be more trouble than he's worth, wanting to be seen and heard by mortal, and not be in the shadows waiting to feed upon them. He learns to play the violin like an angel,
but kills a Gypsy girl and her father after revealing his supernatural attributes while
hunting with Marius.He then discovers the secret room that Queen Akasha [(link=nm0004691]) and her

telling him he can't have forgotten about it. He returns home and once again plays the
treasured instrument. The next day he has a press conference with his band and stirs
up trouble with both humans and vampires, saying that the immortals must come and
find him at his one and only concert in the valley.Soon after he recieves a visit
from Marius and hears that Akasha has awoken and drank her King to death. Now

of his theory.Finally Marius, Maharet and all the other vampire elders gather to make a
plan against Akasha and Lestat. But they are interrupted by the queens arrival with her new king. She tells Lestat to kill Jesse, and mocks the girl when she says that it is what
she desires. Jesse collapses and Akasha says that Lestat is most obediant, he drinks from
her once more, but does not stop and she throws him off. The other vampires try to also kill her, some turn to dust and others survive. But it is Maharet who drinks the last
drop from Akasha. Maharet turns to stone, to slumber forever for drinking the last drop of

Donnie speaks about time travel with Mr. Monnitoff who gives him a book, The Philosophy of Time Travel written by Roberta Sparrow. She used to be a nun and a teacher at the high school. However, the climate at the school is becoming increasingly conservative as Kitty Farmer leads a protest against Ms. Pomeroy's choice of reading material; one of the stories she had assigned, Graham Greene's The Destructors features teenagers who destroy a man's house by flooding it.

He realizes that the 28 days have passed, and that only 6 hours remain until the end of the world.

He steals the car keys from a sleeping Elizabeth and, taking Gretchen with him, drives into the hills above town.From that vantage point, Donnie can see a time tunnel forming over the town.

The three of them hop a train to Texas, where they sit with dozens of others on the roofs of the trains boxcars. Linda explains that she met someone once who told her that someday the world will go up in flames and the good people will avoid it, but for the bad people, God don't even hear you talkin'.

Linda narrates that the farmer knew he was going to die, and that people live only once so they should have it nice. The farmer finally speaks with Abby. She explains she is from Chicago. Linda roasts a peacock over a spit, as Bill tells her a joke: ""I saved your life today. I killed a shit-eating dog. I'm always lookin' out for you."" Apparently a joke by comedian Redd Fox - acknowledged in the end credits in the Thanks section. Bill and Abby have a talk in a haystack.

Linda asks Bill if they are going to stay and he explains its up to Abby. Linda has a conversation with her friend about a worker who she was going with who abandoned her. Linda continues to narrate about Bill getting tired of living like the rest of them, like pigs. Bill figured some people need more than they got, and others got more than they need. It was a matter of getting everyone together. A man dances on a wooden plank to a tune played by harmonica. Bill and Abby continue their discussion about staying. A night time celebration with a bonfire and music occurs. Abby tells the farmer she can stay but shes got to keep her brother and sister with her. Lindas friend says good bye and many people leave on a train similar to the way they arrived. Linda questions Abby about why she wants to stay and she explains this isnt so bad to the way she had to live earlier, wrapping cigars, never seeing the light of day. The foreman questions Linda about what they did in Chicago before. Bill explains to the farmer a half-story about how he worked at the mill in Chicago. The farmer tells Abby he loves her.

They sneak in a bit late, after the farmer has begun calling for her. Life goes on. The foreman tells the farmer he thinks they are a couple of con-artists. The farmer takes offense and they have a falling out.

A shot of a newspaper shows that president Wilson is on a whistlestop tour. They all go out to watch his train go by. Linda narrates that the farmer wasnt getting sicker as fast as they planned. Maybe the doctor gave him some medicine. Bill and the farmer go hunting for pheasant. The farmer remarks that Bill seems jumpy. Right during their conversation a Fokker tri-plane and a Sopwith camel come into a view as a flying circus lands right in their field. just as things were about to blow says Linda. The circus brings entertainment. Bill kisses Abby one night at the gazebo but the farmer sees it. He confronts Abby later about this strange behavior with her brother. She denies anything unusual but remarks to Bill that the farmer seems more paranoid. Bill is now angry that Abby seems to be in love with the farmer. Bill who is in a bit of a huff, gets a lift from the flying circus to take care of some business. The farmer and Abby are now alone.There are loving scenes between Abby and the farmer. Linda narrates that the farmer taught her the keys on the piano, the parts of a globe. Life continues. The following spring comes. The wheat begins to ripen. Bill comes back on a motorcycle and sees Abby dancing on the porch. Later, Abby apologizes to Bill. Bill explains he regrets not knowing what he had with her, and pushing her into this plot. Bill kisses Abby on his way to leave, and the farmer sees him from up on the roof with his weathervane. He seems a bit sickened.A close-up of a two locusts on some lettuce in the kitchen is a portent of a problem. They are shown bothering the birds. Things evolve rapidly. Abby begins swatting locusts all over the house. They are shown all over the wheat. A red storm flag is hoisted, and a warning siren is sounded, and the workers pile into the field to get rid of the swarm by any means possible. The farmer out in the smoking fields is suspicious of Bill and swings his lantern at him starting a fire. The fire spreads and starts to burn the entire field. Bill and Abby are silhouetted against the fire and she says, ""He knows"".The hands desperately try to put the fire out but it burns everything. The farmer aggressively intimidates Abby up in the bedroom, throws her down and gets a gun out of his desk. He ties her hands together and calls her a liar. The next day, the farmer is riding through his burnt out fields looking for Bill and finds him fixing his motorcycle. The farmer aims a gun at Bill but bill stabs him with a leather punch. The foreman finds the dead Sam Shepard. The three of them flee.They head down river in a boat. Linda narrates that no one is perfect, youve just got half devil and half angel in you. She explains that Abby will lead a good life from now on, she blamed it all on herself. Linda talks about all the things they see on the boat ride. In parallel action, the foreman begins to track them down.Wild turkeys gobble in the forest, where Bill, Abby, and Linda have camped. Bill walks under some trees, and notices police officers at their ferry boat at the river, presumably looking for him. They spot him and come chasing after him with dogs and horses. He gets back to the tent and grabs a shotgun. He tells them to keep down and then tries to run away as he is pursued. Eventually, he makes a run along the shore line and ends up in a gunfight. He is shot and killed by one of the pursuers on horseback. In her grief, Abby sobs over Bills body as detached people on the shoreline look on.The next scene is Linda in a dancing class. Abby has enrolled her in a dance academy. We dont know exactly how much time has passed. She tells Linda shell be all right, turn around and go inside. Abby walks to the train station through a small town. Young men are boarding a train to participate in World War I which the U.S. has just gotten involved in. A band plays a tune to bid the soldiers goodbye as Abby boards the train with the soldiers.The next morning, Linda escapes from the dance academy. She runs into her friend from the fields who has a new boyfriend. He's in the Army. Maybe he'll get killed or something. I don't know. Anyway, he said I'm pretty. They race away and chat at the railroad tracks, and then walk down the rails towards an uncertain future. Linda narrates This girl, she didn't know where she was goin' or what she was goin' to do. She didn't have no money on her. Maybe she'd meet up with a character. I was hopin' things would work out for her. She was a good friend of mine.

Because of an altercation he has with his mill foreman, Bill, a laborer, decides to leave his home base of Chicago, and become an itinerant farm worker along with his girlfriend, Abby, and his young teen sister, Linda. Bill and Abby tell those that they meet that they are siblings if only because of the poor optics of them traveling together without being married. They head to the panhandle of Texas, where they end up working on a large wheat farm. The wealthy but sickly farmer is immediately attracted to Abby, falls in love with her and wants to marry her. Bill encourages her to marry him if only because he expects the farmer to die soon, and they would then be able to live off his wealth. Abby goes along with Bill's scheme and marries the farmer.

"Claire Bartel (Annabella Sciorra), her husband Michael (Matt McCoy), and their 6-year-old daughter Emma (Madeline Zima) live in a large house in Seattle, Washington. One sunny morning, there is a knock at the door. No one answers the door, because they're so busy that they don't hear the knocking. A few seconds later, Claire notices a black man at the kitchen window. This is the man who was knocking on the door, and Claire has been expecting him. The man is Solomon (Ernie Hudson), a mentally handicapped man who has been sent over by the Better Day Society, which finds jobs for the mentally challenged. Solomon was sent because Claire had asked for someone who could build a white picket fence for the house, and Solomon is the man for the job.Later that same day, Claire, who is three months pregnant, keeps an appointment with her new OB/GYN, Dr. Victor Mott (John de Lancie). This is Claire's first visit with Dr. Mott, because the doctor who delivered Emma has retired. Claire is called to an examination room, where a nurse tells her to take everything off and put on a robe that is opened in the front. After Claire does this, Dr. Mott enters the room and introduces himself to Claire, and he acknowledges that Claire's medical record says that she has chronic asthma. Dr. Mott starts the exam, doing the breast exam first, and when Dr. Mott starts doing the pelvic exam, he starts touching Claire in a way that she doesn't like. Frightened by that, a wheezing Claire gets out of there, and uses her inhalant to help her breathe better. (Note: Claire's severe chronic ashma is triggered by the slightest stress throughout the film). Claire then goes home and takes a shower, then she tells Michael what Dr. Mott did.Michael suggests filing a complaint against Dr. Mott, so Claire tells the state medical board what Dr. Mott did, and a week after Claire's visit with Dr. Mott, Dr. Mott is brought up on charges. By this time, four more women have accused Dr. Mott of the same thing he did to Claire.A few hours after Dr. Mott is brought up on charges, he grabs a gun at his home, puts the end of the barrel to his head, and pulls the trigger. On the next day, Claire and Michael read about Dr. Mott's suicide in the newspaper.Nine days later, in a meeting with lawyers, Dr. Mott's wife (Rebecca De Mornay) is told that his assets have been frozen by the state, which is normal procedure if the estate is probably going to be sued by a number of sources. Mrs. Mott, who is seven months pregnant, is free to stay in the Mott house until she gives birth to her baby, but that she may be made liable in the lawsuits. On her way out of the meeting, Mrs. Mott collapses and starts bleeding heavily. Mrs. Mott is rushed to the hospital, where she has a miscarriage. The baby was a boy. After an emergency hysterectomy, Mrs. Mott is in her hospital room, and she is watching the TV news, which says that Claire made the first accusation against Dr. Mott. Mrs. Mott stares at Claire's picture on the TV with an enraged look on her face. Mrs. Mott believes Claire is responsible for the deaths of Dr. Mott and her baby.Six months later. Solomon is still doing jobs for the Bartels, and he has become a friend to them. By this time, Claire has given birth to her baby, a boy named Joe (Eric Melander, Jennifer Melander, and Ashley Melander). The family's botanical garden is replacing its small greenhouses in the back yard, and Claire decides to see if she can get one of the frames so she can have her own small greenhouse. Michael wonders if Claire has been taking on too much lately, and he talks about hiring a nanny, a thought that Claire is not comfortable with.A few days later, Claire walks Emma outside and watches Emma get on a Puget Sound Elementary School bus. A few seconds after pulling away, the bus stops, and Mrs. Mott steps out from in front of it. Claire hurries to the bus and gives Emma a jacket that she forgot. Mrs. Mott asks Claire where the Bartels live, and Claire introduces herself, unaware that she's talking to Dr. Mott's widow. Mrs. Mott introduces herself as 'Peyton Flanders', and asks about the nanny position that the Bartels have offered.In the house, Claire interviews Peyton, then takes her upstairs to meet Joe, but before they get to the nursery, Solomon calls Claire outside. Peyton goes inside the nursery by herself, and meets Joe for the first time.Claire brings Solomon upstairs and introduces him to Peyton. After that, Solomon goes back downstairs. Claire then starts breast feeding Joe, and she invites Peyton to dinner. Later, when Peyton returns to the house for dinner, and she asks what Michael does for a living, Claire says that Michael is a genetic engineer at a place called Biotechnics. After the dinner, Claire and Michael decide to hire Peyton.Over the next few weeks, Peyton moves into a room in the basement, and spends some time settling in. One night, Peyton's alarm clock goes off at 3:00 am, and she goes to Joe's room, puts a pillow in Joe's crib, and starts breast-feeding Joe.On the next day, preparations for the new greenhouse continue. That night, Michael and Claire's friends Marlene Craven (Julianne Moore) and her husband Marty (Kevin Skousen) come over, because they'll all four be going out for dinner while Peyton stays home with Emma and Joe.After everyone leaves, Emma tells Peyton that before Michael met Claire, Marlene was Michael's girlfriend. Marlene and Michael grew up with each other. Emma also tells Peyton that at school, a bully named Roth (Justin Zaremby) has been terrorizing her.Later, Peyton breast-feeds Joe again. By this time, Joe is three months old. On the next day, Peyton heads to the school during recess and asks Emma which kid Roth is. Emma points to a boy in a blue and white shirt.
Peyton, angry at Roth for terrorizing Emma, walks up to Roth and grabs him by the arm, pulling him into a well-deserved and very painful hold. While Peyton has Roth in this painful hold, Peyton furiously warns Roth that she'll tear his head off if he ever messes with Emma again. This has the rest of the kids laughing at Roth for a change, instead of Roth laughing at them all the time.On the next morning, Claire tries to breast feed Joe, but Joe resists, because he has secretly become used to Peyton breast-feeding him. As Michael goes to work, leaving a proposal for Claire to drop off at the Federal Express building, the greenhouse is delivered. Claire, Peyton, and Joe head to the botanical garden, where Claire has been a volunteer for about seven years. After talking to Clair, Peyton heads to the bathroom, gets out the proposal, which she secretly stole from Claire, and tears it up, then she grabs a plunger and angrily starts beating up the walls of the stall she's in.At the federal express building, they won't let Claire ship out what she thinks is the proposal. Stressed out, Claire is wheezing from another asthma attack as she returns to the car, and she tells Peyton that the proposal is missing from its pouch. Claire uses her inhalant, and that night, she tells Michael that the proposal disappeared. On the next morning, Claire tells Michael that Joe has, for the past couple of weeks, been refusing to breast feed, but the doctor said Joe will be okay as long as Joe gains weight.Peyton shows up at Michael's office while he's at work, and suggests that they throw Claire a surprise party for her birthday. Michael agrees, and he also likes the suggestion to let Marlene help.Later that day, Solomon is painting when he notices that Peyton is breast-feeding Joe. Peyton notices Solomon, and Solomon climbs down his ladder. Later, the school bus drops Emma off at the house, and after Emma goes inside, Peyton walks outside and confronts Solomon. Peyton slaps Solomon, and then she warns him not to mess with her or tell anyone what he saw. Solomon tells Peyton that he won't let her hurt the Bartels.A few days later, the Bartels surprise Solomon with a new bicycle. While Peyton and Claire are doing laundry, Peyton tells Claire that Solomon has been inappropriately touching Emma, but what Claire doesn't know is that Peyton is lying... Peyton wants Solomon out of the way because, despite being retarded, he knows too much.That night, Claire talks to Emma about Solomon to stay away from him. On the next day, Peyton tricks Claire into searching Solomon's toolbox for batteries, and Claire sees a pair of Emma's underwear in Solomon's toolbox. What Claire doesn't know is that Peyton planted the underwear in the toolbox. Solomon walks in and Claire hits him, starts wheezing, grabs Emma, and goes inside. Peyton gives Solomon an evil look as if to say that Solomon shouldn't have messed with her.Solomon is fired despite his protests of innocence and claims that Peyton set him up. Emma is devastated, because she knows Solomon never did anything to her, except be her friend. Claire refuses to belive Emma that Solomon abused her in any way. It clearly becomes obvious that Peyton is turning Emma against Claire, and Peyton, of course, is the only one who knows this. A few days later, Claire and Peyton take some boxes to the attic, where Claire mentions that Emma has been angry and guarded around Claire lately.A few days later, Peyton suggests to Michael that they prepare Claire's surprise birthday party. Later, Peyton tells Claire that she wonders why Michael is not home from work yet. What Claire doesn't know is that Michael and Marlene are working on plans for the birthday party. When Michael gets home, Claire grills him with a lot of questions. That night, Michael hears a noise and grabs a baseball bat, and then he goes to the kitchen where he sees Peyton picking ice up off the floor because she dropped an ice tray. Michael goes back to bed.On Claire's birthday, at Auditorium Cleaners, a dry-cleaning business, Claire finds evidence that leads her to go home and confront Michael, and she accuses Michael of having an affair with Marlene, unaware that Peyton planted the evidence. When Claire walks into the living room, she sees people assembled for the surprise birthday party, and Claire realizes that she was wrong to accuse Michael of cheating. Claire feels so guilty about the accusation, that she can't face Marlene, who overheard the accusation. Claire goes upstairs, where she breaks down in Michael's arms.Claire says that so many things have gone wrong since they hired Peyton, who overhears them discussing going away for a few days. A few hours later, at 4:45 am, Peyton gets up and rigs a booby trap the greenhouse to kill Claire by showering Claire with glass the next time Claire walks into the greenhouse.A few hours later, at Marlene's office, she notices something suspicious in a picture of Dr. Mott's house, which hasn't been sold. At the same time, Claire heads to the botanical garden, and Marlene looks over some back issues of a newspaper, and gets evidence that Peyton is Dr. Mott's widow.Marlene heads straight to the Bartel house with the intention of telling Claire what she has discovered. At the house, Marlene angrily wants to know where Claire is. Aware that Marlene on to her, Peyton tells Marlene that Claire is in the greenhouse, which is not true. Marlene goes out back to the greenhouse, where the booby trap causes the overhead frames to close shut which triggers a shower of glass that kills Marlene. After panicing for a minute over what to do next, Peyton then empties Claire's inhaler, so Claire won't recover from her next asthma attack.Later, Claire arrives home from the gardens while Peyton has Joe out for a walk. Claire goes to the greenhouse and sees Marlene's bloody body covered with glass impailed to her body. As expected, the sight causes Claire to have another severe asthma attack, which is the reason why Peyton emptied Claire's inhaler and left Marlene's body for Claire to see since sudden stress triggers Claire's asthma. When Claire goes inside, she tries to use her inhaler, which is useless because it's empty, and Claire grabs the phone and calls for help, then she collapses on the front porch. Claire is rushed to the hospital, and Marlene's body is removed from the greenhouse. At his apartment, Solomon is worried about the Bartels. At home, Peyton comes on to Michael, who turns her down.A few days later, Claire comes home from the hospital. In Joe's room, Claire notices that Peyton has put up some wall border with turtle designs on it. While going through some clothes in a hamper, Claire finds a piece of paper that says that Marlene called just before she was killed.Claire heads to Marlene's office, where she sees the picture of Dr. Mott's house. Claire then goes to Dr. Mott's house, where she sees the same wall border that's in Joe's room, with the turtle designs on it. It is where wher Claire sees a wedding photo of Dr. Mott with Peyton as his bride. Claire goes home, where she confronts Peyton, and she immediately punches Peyton in the face as hard as she can. Michael runs in after hearing the comotion where Claire tells him that Peyton is Dr. Mott's widow.With the gig up, Peyton finally reveals her true idenity ('Peyton Flanders' is actually her maiden name) and confesses that she set everything up to get hired as the nanny because wants revenge on Claire, because Peyton believes Claire is responsible for Dr. Mott's suicide and Peyton's miscarriage by reporting his sexual abuse of her. Peyton wants Claire to know how devastated this all made her feel, so Peyton has been trying to manipulate and take Michael, Emma, and Joe away from Claire so Peyton can have a family and leave Claire with nothing. Claire argues that Peyton has nobody to blame but her late unethical husband for sexually abusing Claire and all his other female patients that has led to all this in the first place. But the cleary warped Peyton continues to blame Claire for her husband's sucide and her miscarrage. When Michael asks Peyton what she would have done after suspecting or figuring out that her own husband was sexualy abusing his patients, Peyton replies that she would have protected her husband... clearly not caring about his crimes.Claire and Michael fire Peyton, and they force her to get out of the house immediately. After Peyton leaves, Claire then tells Michael to call the police, because she realizes that Peyton may have rigged the greenhouse to kill her instead of Marlene. Michael tells Claire to get Emma and Joe ready so the four of them can go to a hotel until Peyton is found. Michael apologizes to Claire about everything that has happened and how Peyton so easily fooled all of them. Michael even says that he even feels a little bit sorry for Peyton for the shock and stress of discovering her late husband's crimes and his suicide which has led to her miscarrage and her sanity breaking. Claire tells Michael that she thinks Peyton Mott was already insane and dangerously disturbed long before she ever met Dr. Mott because her indifference to her late husband's crimes suggests life-long untreated psychotic behavior.That same night, before they leave, Michael talks to the police on the phone to report Peyton and about the accusations of Marlene's death. After hanging up, Michael hears a noise coming from the basement.
Michael goes downstairs and turns off Peyton's alarm clock, which is what was making the noise. When Michael reaches the top of the stairs on his way out of the basement, Peyton appears and hits Michael with a shovel, causing Michael to fall over the guardrail and land on the concrete floor below.Claire, who is upstairs with Emma, hears the noise of Peyton's attack on Michael. Claire goes out of the room and has Emma lock the room's door. Claire goes to the basement, where she finds Michael. Michael, who now has two broken legs, convinces Claire that he's okay, and then he tells Claire that Peyton is back in the house. Michael also tells Claire to call the police.Emma unlocks the door to the room she's in. Claire goes to the kitchen and picks up the phone. That's when Peyton appears and starts swinging the shovel at Claire. On the 8th swing, Peyton hits Claire on the head and knocks Claire out cold. Peyton goes upstairs and asks Emma where Joe is, because Peyton plans to leave town and take Emma and Joe with her. Emma points to Joe's room. Peyton goes inside of Joe's room, but doesn't see Joe. Thats when Emma shuts the room's door and locks it, trapping Peyton in the room. Emma then grabs Joe, and Peyton grabs a fireplace poker and uses it to break out of the room.Still carrying the poker, Peyton looks for Emma and Joe. Claire wakes up from being out cold. Peyton goes to the attic, where she sees Joe on a couch, and Solomon enters the attic through a window and grabs Joe to protect Joe from Peyton. Claire enters the attic with a large knife and attacks. Peyton swings the poker and knocks the knife out of Claire's hand, then she knocks Claire to the floor, and Claire starts wheezing from another ashma attack.Peyton angrily tells Solomon to hand the baby to her, but Solomon refuses. Peyton raises the poker to hit Solomon, and before Peyton can hit Solomon, Claire charges forward and slams Peyton against a wall and knocks Peyton to the floor, then slams Peyton's head against the floor two times. Peyton kicks Claire aside and grabs the poker, and just as Peyton is about to hit Claire with the poker, Solomon grabs Peyton's arm to stop her. Peyton pulls her arm free and hits Solomon two times with the poker. Claire charges forward again, and this time, she shoves Peyton through the attic window. Peyton falls downward, and she lands on the white picket fence below where she gets impaled on the wooden slat, killing her instantly.After the police arrive and remove Peyton's dead body, Claire and Michael welcome Solomon back into their lives."

As such, Birdee, with her and Bill's adolescent daughter Bernice Pruitt in tow, decides to head back to their hometown of Smithville, Texas to live temporarily with her mother, Ramona Calvert, basically to hide-out until she figures out what to do. Beyond the issues of Bill's infidelity and Connie's deceit, Birdee eking out a life in Smithville is difficult for many reasons. Birdee doesn't have any marketable job skills to support herself and Bernice. Many of Birdee and Bill's high school colleagues have their own views of Birdee then and now, which taint how they treat her. Birdee has her own views of how she sees her life, it, now without Bill, not what she had envisioned for herself. So Birdee is living out a somewhat self-fulfilling prophesy of the failure that she sees her life. Although Birdee holds onto her martial vows for as long as she and Bill are still married, Bernice holds onto the notion of their family even stronger, she largely blaming Birdee for their current problems as she asserts that Birdee didn't love Bill enough for him to want to stay married. As such, Bernice openly wishes for her father to come take her away. Bernice's negative view of life in Smithville is exacerbated by being bullied by a classmate known as Big Dolores. Through it all, Ramona hopes that Birdee will get together with Justin Matisse, who, with Birdee, were each other's first kiss when they were adolescents. Justin has always been attracted to Birdee and thus wants at least to get to know a now grown up Birdee. Birdee has to decide how much she is willing to give of herself now to anyone who isn't Bill, whether it be Justin or someone else.::Huggo"

It's also the time of the year in which his companion Jacob Marley died seven years ago. When he is all alone, he suddenly sees Marley again, in the door handle, in a tile, a bell suddenly rings. Humbug, thinks Scrooge. But then Marley really appears for him and tells him he should change his life. He warns Scrooge he will be haunted by three spirits, the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present and the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come.::Arnoud Tiele (imdb@tiele.nl)"
"During a future ice age, dying humanity occupies its remaining time by playing a board game called ""Quintet."" For one small group, this obsession is not enough; they play the game with living pieces ... and only the winner survives.::Anonymous"
"In the distant future the world is in the grip of another ice age. A city originally built to house five million people is now in its death throes as the relentlessly advancing glacier is slowly crushing the metropolis's steel infrastructure. The relatively few surviving fur-clad inhabitants, perhaps thousands, perhaps only hundreds, drift aimlessly in their grim, drab world, awaiting their inevitable fate as they try to survive from day to day with scavenged firewood and minimal diet. Their only solaces are booza, an alcoholic drink distilled from moss, and Quintet, a seemingly innocuous board game for six players. The only other surviving mammals are roving packs of hungry mastiffs which roam the city's corridors and quickly dispose of the remains of the dead. Newly arrived from the south is Essex with his pregnant wife Vivia, seeking shelter in the doomed city only to find it populated by people middle-aged or older. They had supported themselves by hunting seals, but now that the last of the aquatic mammals has been killed off, they seek shelter in the apartment of Essex's brother, a renowned Quintet player. The new arrivals quickly learn that the game has a more sinister side.::duke1029@aol.com"

"William Munny (Clint Eastwood) is a widower with two young children. He was once a very vicious gunfighter, but after marrying, gave up gunfighting, drinking, and most other vices. His wife died of smallpox in 1878, but he continues to try to eke out a living with his children on their hog farm, and to try to be the kind of man he believes his late wife would want him to be. It is now 1880.The town of Big Whiskey, Wyoming is ruled rather arbitrarily by a sheriff named Little Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman). Two cowboys, Davey (Rob Campbell) and Mike (David Mucci) are spending their leave at a brothel owned by Skinny Dubois (Anthony James). One of the women, Delilah, makes an offhanded comment that Mike perceives as an insult, so he attacks her with a knife, scarring her face. Skinny and the de facto madam, Strawberry Alice (Frances Fisher) hold them until Little Bill can arrive. The women want Davey and Mike to hang, but Little Bill decides that since they did not murder Delilah, they should be horse-whipped instead. However, Skinny is more concerned with potential loss of business due to Delilah's disfigurement. So Little Bill decrees that instead of being horsewhipped, the men will have to give Skinny some horses. This outrages the women even more, and afterward they meet privately and pool all their resources to offer a reward to anyone who will kill the two attackers.We meet Munny on his farm trying to deal with some sick hogs. It quickly becomes clear that he is not a very good hog farmer, as he repeatedly falls in the mud when trying to grab a hog. In the midst of this he has a visitor, a young man calling himself the Scofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett), who knows Munny by reputation and would like his help in killing Davey and Mike in return for half the reward money. Munny makes it clear that he is not interested because, since marrying his late wife, he doesn't do the things he used to do anymore. But after the Kid leaves, Munny goes back to his bumbling attempts at tending hogs, and begins to have second thoughts. He sets a can on a tree stump and begins firing at it with his pistol, without hitting it. Finally he goes in the house and gets his shotgun, and blows the can away on the first shot.Back in Big Whiskey, Davey and Mike show up with the horses for Skinny. The women throw stones and horse manure at them. Mike has never shown any remorse at any point, but Davey seems genuinely sorry about what happened to Delilah. He pointedly tells Skinny that one of the horses is not for him, and then offers it to Delilah. The women only throw more manure.Realizing that he will need help in the tracking down the wayward cowboys, Munny decides to contact his former partner, Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman). He says goodbye to his kids, telling them if they need anything to see Ned's common law wife, Sally Two Trees. After several bumbling and unsuccessful attempts to mount his horse, he finally mounts successfully and rides to Ned's. Sally, apparently recognizing that whatever Munny has in mind cannot end well, just glares at him without speaking the entire time he is there. If looks could kill, not only Munny and Ned but the entire movie audience would be dead by the end of the scene. But as it is, the two men ride off in pursuit of the Kid. Eventually they catch him, and soon discern that he is severely nearsighted and can't see a target more than 50 yards away.The first to arrive in Big Whiskey in pursuit of the reward is a gray-haired Englishman known as English Bob (Richard Harris). We first meet him traveling on a train with his biographer, named Beauchamp (Saul Rubinek). President Garfield has just been shot (which, of course, occurred in 1881, meaning that some months have passed since the original attack on Delilah), and Bob is lecturing his fellow-passengers on the benefits of monarchy over democracy (despite the Russian Tsar also being assassinated earlier that same year). He and Beauchamp arrive in Big Whiskey, where Little Bill catches him concealing a gun. He brutally beats and kicks Bob until he is nearly unconscious, then throws both him and Beauchamp in jail. At the jail, Little Bill debunks many of the stories Bob has told Beauchamp about his exploits. Soon Beauchamp is out of his cell and working as Little Bill's biographer rather than Bob's. Little Bill finally puts Bob on a train out of town. Munny and his companions see the train carrying English Bob go by as they approach town.A torrential downpour begins, and by the time the Munny party reaches town, Munny is sick with fever. Arriving at the saloon, Ned and the Kid go upstairs to engage the services of the prostitutes, but Munny doesn't do that sort of thing anymore and remains downstairs. Little Bill sizes Munny up as an out-of-towner after the reward money, and beats and kicks him in a similar way to what he did to English Bob, has him thrown out into the street, and sends his deputies upstairs after Ned and the Kid. Ned and the Kid escape through a window, manage to get Munny onto his horse, and ride out of town, where Ned nurses Munny back to health with the help of some of the prostitutes.By the time Munny has regained his health, the rain has stopped but there is snow on the ground. In the next scene the snow is gone, meaning some time has been elapsing as Munny's partners have scouted out their targets. In that next scene, we see Davey with a group of cowboys chasing a calf. A shot rings out, hitting Davey's horse, which falls over, breaking the man's leg and pinning him to the ground. Ned fired the shot, but now he can't bring himself to finish the man off, and the Kid can't see that far, so Munny fires several shots and finally hits him. As Davey lies dying, he complains of being thirsty. Munny calls out to the other cowboys to give the man a drink, and promises not to shoot. They do, and Munny is true to his word.Ned has had enough of killing and leaves his companions to return home, but is captured by Little Bill's men, and we see him being interrogated by Little Bill. Men are also assigned to protect Mike. Munny and the Kid wait outside the house where Mike and his guards are holed up. When Mike comes out to use the outhouse, the Kid waits until he is finished and then shoots him. But the Kid can't deal with the fact that he has killed a man (he has boasted repeatedly of having killed five men, but now admits that this was his first), and resolves to never kill again, telling Munny, ""I'm not like you."" Munny has him drink some whiskey, but it doesn't help.One of the prostitutes brings the reward money and informs them that Ned has been killed, after revealing Munny's identity. Munny sends the Kid home with the reward money, telling him to leave his and Ned's shares with his children and take the rest and use it to buy some good spectacles. He then rides toward town, drinking whiskey from a bottle as he goes. Outside the saloon, he sees Ned's body upright in an open casket, with a sign saying that this is what happens to assassins in this town.Munny enters the saloon, where most of the townsmen have gathered. He asks who owns the establishment, and when Skinny identifies himself, Munny tells the men near him to move away, and then shoots him. Little Bill calls him a coward for shooting an unarmed man, but Munny replies, ""He should have armed himself, if he's going to decorate his saloon with my friend."" He then tells those near Little Bill to move away. His shotgun misfires, but he throws it at Little Bill, draws his pistol and shoots him, and shoots several other men attempting to draw guns on him; some of them get shots off before Munny kills them, but none hit him.He then tells everyone who doesn't want to be killed to leave, and all who are able to leave do so. He goes to the bar and helps himself to more whiskey. Beauchamp was not able to leave because of a body lying on top of him. Munny has him give him a rifle lying nearby, which he loads. Beauchamp tries to engage him in conversation about gunfighting, but Munny's response frightens him into leaving as well. Little Bill turns out to still be alive, but Munny hears him cock his pistol, and steps on his hand before he can get a shot off.As Munny aims his rife at Little Bill, the latter complains that he doesn't deserve this. Munny replies, ""'Deserves' has nothing to do with it."" Little Bill then says, ""I'll see you in hell, William Munny."" Munny simply replies, ""Yeah,"" and shoots him. As he walks to the saloon door, one of the men he shot previously moans in pain, and he shoots him again.At the door, he announces that he is coming out, that he will kill anyone he sees, and if anyone shoots at him, he will kill not only the shooter but his wife and all his friends and burn his house down. He walks to his horse, and no one shoots. He mounts his horse and as he rides past Ned's body, he announces that if they don't bury Ned right, or if they harm the prostitutes in any way, he'll come back and kill every man in the town.As the closing credits roll, we learn that Munny subsequently moved with his children to San Francisco, where he ""prospered in dry goods."""

Long-repressed feelings of bitterness and betrayal explode when three inner-city losers plot the robbery of a valuable coin in a seedy second-hand junk shop.::Gabe Taverney (duke1029@aol.com)
"AMERICAN BUFFALO is another story of men's interminable struggle toward the top of the heap, a goal which ultimately and inevitably eludes most of us. Don Dubro, the proprietor of a dusty dark inner-city junk shop, holds court there with his friends and makes plans probably on a daily basis for his ascendancy to the top. He does this more out of habit than hope because he's long ago surrendered his future to the daily repetition of his life as guardian of the discarded remnants of others' possessions. Disheveled Teach, on the other hand, is either too dumb or too stubborn to accept the lot life has dealt him. Instead, he bucks like a wild horse under the saddle and refuses to be broken. Most pitiable of the trio which populates the movie is teen-aged Bobby. Mistaking much of the palaver which passes between the older men as pearls of wisdom, Bobby is the only one of the trio who still has a chance to make a life for himself somewhere beyond this tired too-familiar neighborhood. Don seems to recognize, early in their heist scheme, that exposing Bobby to his desperation can only drag the kid down. Teach imposes himself into Bobby and Don's plan to swipe some pricey coins from one of Don's customers. Don's plan to send Bobby in after the coin is too risky, Teach says. The truth is simpler. Teach doesn't want his cut to be too small.::Mark Fleetwood <mfleetwo@mail.coin.missouri.edu>"

"During the night of 27th to 28th September 1994, the Swedish-Estonian ferry ESTONIA sank in the middle of the Baltic Sea. 852 people lost their lives, only 145 were saved. Until today this has remained the biggest shipping catastrophe in European waters since the end of World War II. JULIA REUTER, a journalist with a leading German television magazine in Berlin, is trying to get a scoop on military black market arms trafficking from Russia. Her investigations lead her to Tallinn in Estonia, where on the evening of September 27, 1994 she misses the ferry ESTONIA, by mere minutes. One of the vehicles on the ship is a truck loaded with high-tech weapons. ERIK WESTERMARK is a Swedish lawyer, who is coming from a sailing trip along the Estonian coast with his 10-year-old son. They were setting off for the return trip back home to Sweden, aboard the ESTONIA. But the ferry doesn't make her port of call. She sinks in the midst of the cold Baltic Sea. Erik Westermark is among the rescued. The fate of his son remains initially uncertain. While reporting about the tragic sinking Julia meets Erik in Stockholm in a hospital. Both notice soon that the hastily assembled governmental investigating commission is very concerned with hushing up the actual background facts of the sinking. Through information from an Ex Stasi and KGB Agent, they come to understand that there is a connection between the secret arms transports and the sinking of the passenger ferry. They also make the startling discover that the ship's second captain, has simply vanished after having been rescued. Since Erik Westermark last saw his son together with the captain, he investigates this with hope that his son may still be alive as well. As Julia and Erik persistently seek to get to the bottom of the whole story, they become embroiled in the intricate crossfire between secret services and militaries. Getting closer and closer to the truth, they follow a hot trail and end up becoming the hunted themselves. Finally they are able to track down LOU ALDRYN a high ranking Pentagon official and the main puppetmaster in the background. What had started as a somewhat ""normal"" search for the truth of the ESTONIA disaster ends up as a final confrontation between ""David"" and ""Goliath"".::TOP STORY Filmproduction GmbH"

"The film opens with ""Flashdance... What a Feeling,"" which is a recurring theme throughout the entire film. During the opening credits 18-year-old Alexandra 'Alex' Owens (Jennifer Beals) rides her bicycle through Pittsburgh on her way to work as a welder at one of the city's steel mills.After work, Alex moonlights as a dancer at Mawby's Bar, which features dancers in a go-go atmosphere. Nick Hurley, one of the steel mill bosses, enters the bar as Alex performs a dance to ""He's a Dream."" Nick is intrigued by Alex. His friend tells him that she works for him at the mill.Richie, the bar's cook, wants to be go to Los Angeles to become a standup comedian. He tries out some of his material on Jeanie, one of the waitresses.At work the next day, Nick introduces himself to Alex, tells her he saw her dance and asks why a dancer would be working as a welder. She responds, ""a girl's got to make a living."" Their first meeting ends when Nick is called away to another area of the mill.Alex lives by herself in a converted warehouse loft with her pit bull, named Grunt. When she gets home from work, she channel surfs for something worth watching on TV. She stops on some ballet dancers performing to ""Adagio for Strings"" and attempts to copy their moves. It is Alex's dream to study at a local, prestigious school of dance, the Pittsburgh Dance and Repertory Company.She changes into exercise clothes, tapes her bare feet and feverously exercises to ""Maniac."" The song's lyrics reflect her passion to become a serious dancer. After her strenuous workout, she's exhausted.The next day Alex bikes to the Repertory building to obtain an application, but is discouraged when she finds several girls waiting for applications. The lady in the admissions office instructs them to list all their previous years of training. Alex leaves without an application and bikes to work.When Alex and Nick share an elevator ride at work, he asks her to lunch or dinner, but she tells him she doesn't have dinner with the boss.Later Alex visits Hanna Long, a retired professional dancer, who has become her mentor. Hanna encourages Alex to pursue her dream of becoming a professional ballet dancer, but Alex makes excuses for not auditioning for the Rep.After she leaves Hanna's, Alex bikes to a nearby church where she confesses to the priest that she thinks a lot about sex and she told a lie. Hanna was badgering Alex to get the application for the Rep, but she didn't want to make her friend unhappy by telling her that she didn't have the courage to go through with it.In the next scene Johnny C., who runs the Zanzibar strip club, and his not-too-bright bodyguard, Cecil, try to entice customers into his club.At a self service laundry, Alex notices that Jeanie is washing Richie's underwear, confirming that these two are a serious couple. Jeanie's father is giving her a hard time because Richie hasn't proposed. Jeanie has dreams of becoming a professional ice skater.Next, Alex and several of the dancers from Mawby's exercise with weights and use workout machines to ""I Love Rock 'n' Roll.""As Jeanie and Alex walk down the street, a group of African-American guys breakdance and moonwalk to music played on their jambox. Quite a crowd gathers to watch their demonstration.As the girls continue their walk, a policeman directs traffic. When Alex helps the traffic cop with his duties, it turns into a traffic signal dance, as an excerpt from Georges Bizet's ""Carmen Suite No. 2: Garde montant"" is heard.At dinner at Jeanie's parents house, Alex defends her friend's dream of becoming a professional ice skater even though her parents don't seem to have much confidence in their daughter's abilities. After dinner the two girls go to the ice rink where Jeanie showcases some of her skating skills.In the following scene Richie is backstage practicing some of his jokes waiting to go on while one of the dancers finishes her routine on stage. Alex and a couple of the other dancers are in the audience rooting for him. Jeanie stops her waitressing to listen. At first, Richie's jokes bomb. Only after he threatens to put cockroaches in the hamburgers does the audience warm up to his humor. At the end of his routine, he introduces Tina Tech, who dances to ""Manhunt.""Johnny C. visits Mawby's to recruit some of the dancers to work at the Zanzibar. When he stops Alex and squeezes her buttocks, she pours beer on his crotch. Later after work as Richie and Alex are walking through a parking lot, Johnny and Cecil stop them. After Cecil socks Richie in the nose, Nick breaks up a potentially violent payback. Afterwards, Alex thanks Nick for his help and bikes home. Nick follows her in his Porsche and asks her to dinner again. Once again she reiterates that it isnt a good idea to go out with her boss, so he kiddingly fires her and sets a date for the next evening.On their date, Alex and Nick first attend Jeanie's ice skating competition. Jeanie's parents and Richie are also there to watch her skate to ""Gloria."" Unfortunately, Jeanie falls a couple of times. Afterwards, Alex tries to cheer Jeanie up, but she is discouraged that she has spent so much time and practice towards something that now seems like a waste. Her father, who hasn't been very supportive of his daughter's dream, reassures her of his love.After the ice skating competition Nick and Alex decide to have pizza for dinner. They pick it up and take it back to her warehouse apartment. She immediately changes into a much more comfortable sloppy sweatshirt. Alex tells Nick about the time her father took her family to the symphony. At first, she was bored, but her father suggested that if she closed her eyes she could see the music. Before the evening is over, Nick and Alex end up in bed.The next day the two lovers walk on the railroad tracks as ""Lady, Lady, Lady"" is heard. They go inside an old building where Nick sees Alex spin like a ballet dancer. When he asks her to do it again, she says she was just fooling around. She explains that she has never studied dance; she's read books on ballet and watches ballet, but has never taken classes. Then she explains how she does what she does at Mawby's. She just feels the music, something clicks inside and she becomes somebody else. And she loves to get up there and disappear into the music.In the following scene, Alex dances an avant garde routine in white face makeup to ""Imagination."" The number has a lot to do with fantasies becoming reality. Nobody seems to understand Alex's dance except for one of the other dancers in the club, Heels. During the song Johnny C. asks Jeanie why she doesn't dance. She tells him she's been practicing. After he makes a suggestive remark about doing the horizontal mambo, he gives her a big tip.Alex attends a ballet performance of Claude Debussys ""Prélude à lAprès-midi dun Faune (Prelude to the Afternoon of a Fawn)"" at the Repertory with Hanna. When the ballet is over, Alex happens to see Nick with another woman. She is furious! Still in her concert dress, she rides her bike to his house, throws a rock through one of his windows, calls him a son of a bitch and retreats quickly.Back at the warehouse, her radiator has sprung a leak. While she is on her knees mopping up the water in her concert dress, Richie comes by to tell her goodbye; he's headed for L.A. When she asks about Jeanie, he admits he loves her, but he says he can't continue to cook hamburgers at Mawby's and pretend to be a comedian.The next day at the mill, Nick tries to pay for Alex's lunch at the lunch truck, but she is still very mad. She demands to know who the blond was that was with him the previous evening. He explains that it was his ex-wife. Since they have friends on the Arts Council, he takes her to the benefit once a year. Now Alex feels guilty that she broke his window. When they reconcile, the workers who are sitting around eating their lunch applaud.That evening Nick and Alex have dinner at a fancy restaurant. Alex, who is dressed in a tuxedo coat, eats her lobster with her fingers. During the meal, just as Alex puts her foot on Nick's crotch, his ex-wife, Katie, stops by their table. After a few catty remarks from Katie that are aimed at Alex, Alex takes her tux coat off to reveal she is only wearing a shirt bib and cuffs. Then she proudly announces that on her first date with Nick: ""I fucked his brains out!""Later that evening, Nick and Alex talk about his marriage to Katie; she was high class, educated, from a good family and it made him feel like he had made it. But one day he realized that wasn't what he really wanted. So he started over and went after what he really wanted to do. Alex asks, ""How did you do it?"" Nick answers, ""I took a deep breath and jumped.""Their conversation gave Alex the renewed desire to pursue her dream, so the next day she goes to the Rep for an application. There she is reminded that auditions to the school are by invitation only. Nick sees her leave the building, so he goes inside and finds out about her getting an application. He immediately telephones a friend on the Arts Council asking for a favor.At Mawby's Halloween Party, the owner and his guests are dancing to ""Romeo."" During the party, Richie returns from L.A. Jeanie is very cool towards Richie and leaves the party with Johnny C.When Alex gets a letter from the Repertory, she's afraid to open it. Finally she musters enough courage and is ecstatic when she discovers she's been invited to audition. She runs to find Nick to break the news, who suggests they celebrate at dinner that evening.Later in the day, she bikes to Hanna's to tell her the good news. Hanna congratulates and encourages her.
On an after dinner drive later that evening, Nick commits a faux pas: he says he called the restaurant the previous night and told them this was a special occasion. Alex immediately realizes that he knew she was going to be invited to audition before she received the letter. She makes him stop the car in the middle of a tunnel, gets out and walks away. He tries to make her understand that he just made a phone call to a friend. She, however, yells that she doesn't want his help.Afterward Alex needs to talk to a friend, so she calls Mawby's to talk to Jeanie. They inform her that Jeanie now works at the Zanzibar. Alex immediately heads for the nude club. Before she arrives, we see several of the nude or semi-nude girls performing to ""Seduce Me Tonight."" Once Alex enters the club, she spots Jeanie (clad in only high-heeled shoes and a G-string) dancing, and Alex literally drags her off the stage. When Johnny C. tries to stop her, Alex pushes him out of the way. Outside in the rain, Jeanie asks Alex why she came after her. Alex responds, ""Because you're my friend.""Later that evening, when Alex returns to her warehouse apartment, Nick and Grunt are waiting outside in the rain. When Alex didn't show up at work that day, Nick came to investigate. He accuses her of being scared to audition for the Rep and of using him as an excuse. Just before he leaves he says, ""When you give up your dream, you die.""The next day Alex bikes to Hanna's, but sadly discovers that her mentor had died the previous day. As Alex mourns the loss of her friend and mentor, she picks up a pair of Hanna's ballet slippers to take as a memento. During this and the following scene, ""I'll Be There Where the Heart Is"" is heard. Back at her apartment Alex continues to mourn; the song continues as she sits alone on the floor of her bathroom and wanders aimlessly around her warehouse apartment.Alex returns to Mawby's to pick up her stuff, then goes to confession. She tells the priest ""I want it so much.""
The next scene is Alex's audition for the dance school before five stuffy judges. She puts on a recording of ""Flashdance... What a Feeling,"" starts her dance, stops and starts again. During the slow beginning of the song, the judges seem completely unimpressed and maybe even bored, but when the tempo picks up the stodgy judges begin to loosen up. The lyrics are very germane to the plot. They sing about a dream that is hidden because of fear and about crying in a world made of steel. This dancer hears the music, closes her eyes and allows it to invade her body (like her father had suggested when he took her to the symphony). Then she is the music, she is the rhythm, and she dances as if her life depended on it.The song continues as Alex exits the building with a huge smile on her face. Waiting for her are Nick and Grunt. After Alex hugs Nick, he presents her with a bouquet of roses (like most ballerinas receive after a brilliant performance). When she takes out one rose to give to Nick, the scene freezes to end the film (we are left to speculate whether Alex was accepted into the dance school, but we are confident that she was). As the closing credits begin, ""Flashdance... What a Feeling"" continues, followed by ""Manhunt,"" ""Imagination,"" and ""Maniac.""

"In Pittsburgh, hard working, outwardly strong willed and independently minded eighteen year old Alex Owens is a welder at a steel mill by day, and a nightclub dancer by night, most specifically at a working class neighborhood bar called Mawby's where she is friends with boyfriend/girlfriend Richie Plasic, the bar's short order cook and an aspiring stand-up comic, and Jeanie Szabo, one of the waitresses and a competitive figure skater who is easy prey for anyone willing to play to her many insecurities. As a dancer, Alex is self-taught, picking up whatever she can by any means to make it her own. She dances solely for how it connects her to the music, and not for what anyone watching might think. Partly due to the influence by her elderly ex-ballerina friend Hanna Long, Alex, in an effort to make something out of her life doing something that she loves, does aspire to formal dance training at the Pittsburgh Conservatory of Dance and Repertory, she having saved her welding money to be able to attend. She is however intimidated by the pretension and the qualifications of all the other dancers there to go through with the application process. While dancing at Mawby's, she attracts the attention of one of the customers, Nick Hurley, the divorced owner of the steel mill who doesn't know she works for him until it is pointed out to him by a colleague. Nick is of that working class background, but is self-made through his business. Despite her apprehension of dating the boss, they embark on a relationship. The question becomes whether Alex will be able to bridge the many new gaps in her life to achieve what she wants, with Nick, they who are at different stages and places in their lives, and with the Conservatory and their qualification criteria, structure and formality.::Huggo"

Their time spent together dwindles until weeks goes by without both of them seeing each other.

Emily goes to the deli to see Kaye and ask why they never see each other anymore. Emily becomes suspicious of Kaye's behavior with Andrew (Michael Villafranco) who also works at the deli. When Emily asks if Kaye if she is dating Andrew, Kaye does not answer. Emily notices the ring is not on her finger anymore and tells Kaye she never wants to see her again.Later, Emily regrets what she said and goes to Kaye's house to apologize.

"The film opens with a plan -sequence reminiscent of the one at the beginning of The Travelling Players. A large group of people carrying suitcases and trunks walks from a sea shore to a foreground river bank. At the head of the group walks its leader and spokesman, Spyros (Vassilis Kolovos) and his wife, Danae (Thalia Argirioua). Between them are their five-year-old son and three-year-old adopted daughter. Spyros, answering the voice-over, explains to an unseen character that they are Greek refugees who have escaped from the Bolshevik-overrun Odessa. After being quarantined in Thessaloniki, the refugees have been authorized to settle in the region, and been given this piece of land. This shot is followed by the opening credits, displayed on a grainy background of old photographs.Another long take follows which shows on the same spot, some twelve to fourteen years later, a village erected by these immigrants that they named ""New Odessa."" On the river, a small rowboat docks and unloads a woman and a teenage girl. The young girl is Spyros' now grownup adopted daughter, Eleni (Alexandra Aidini), accompanied by her mother. Eleni has just given birth to twin boys in secret, away from her home, and has given them up for adoption. She is escorted to Spyros' house, the largest in the village. The twins' father is none other than her step-brother, Alexis, the boy who walked next to Eleni in the prologue shot.In the next scene, horseback riders are combing the area, searching for Eleni. She had just married Spyros, but at the close of the church ceremony, she ran away with Alexis. The couple escapes to Thessaloniki by hailing a passing truck that carries the group of musicians who were returning from the wedding. The group is lead by Nikos (Giorgos Armenis), the violinist, who from then on will be a father figure for Alexis, and take the runaway couple under his protection. In Thessaloniki, Nikos takes Eleni and Alexis to a large theater that has been converted into a refugee shelter, with each family living in curtained boxes and tented stalls. A vengeful Spyros appears in the theater and the fugitives have to escape once more to another shelter.In the morning, Alexis and Eleni go to a musicians' hangout and meet a group of musicians who serenade them. Nikos recognizes the great talent of Alexis as an accordionist and will do his best to promote him. Nikos forms a loose group of musicians and tries to get gigs for them, but without much success. We have just passed the great depression, and we are approaching the Popular Front of 1936. Alexis' accordionist talents get him an audition with Markos, a famous and enterprising musician who is planning to put together a band and go to the United States to play for the Greek immigrant community. Markos, also impressed by Alexis' talent, promises him that he will be part of his group going to the ""promised land,"" but this trip will not happen in the immediate future.Eleni's twins, Yannis and Yorgis, now about twelve years old, are reunited with her. It is 1936, and the musicians have aligned themselves with the Popular Front. In one scene, they are playing in an old beer hall for Union members who have been hunted down by the police. At the dance, a tense scene takes place when Spyros re-appears. He dances with his wife, Eleni, and later collapses of a heart attack. His son Alexis says, ""I killed him."" What follows is one of those long takes, a beautiful plan-sequence, typical of Angelopoulos' lyrical creations: Spyros' funeral on the water.Following his father's funeral, Alexis returns to his father's house in New Odessa with Eleni and his two children. There, he finds his father's sheep, all slaughtered by the villagers, hanging from a tree by the house. As the family moves into the house, a barrage of stones breaks the windows, thrown by the unforgiving villagers. During the night, the village is flooded by the rising waters of the nearby lake, and has to be abandoned by its inhabitants. At dawn, in another striking plan-sequence, people are rowing their boats among the partly-submerged houses, toward higher ground. They are carrying their meager possessions to safety. By contrast, Alexis and his family huddle together without any belongings. There are now completely destitute. Through the night, the villagers, carrying icons, perform an exorcism dance around a bonfire. In the morning they row their boats while carrying black flags through their flooded village, past a small islet where a school once stood. The teacher is there, among the empty benches, with Yannis and Yorgis.The Popular Front has definitely been vanquished. Many of its members are being rounded up, tortured, lined up against walls to be executed by the Falangists. In a lyrical scene, there is a field of white sheets (but where are the pillowcases?) hanging to dry in the wind. Scattered among them, musicians are playing their various instruments. The musicians eventually gather by the seashore. Shots ring out, and they disperse. Alexis and Eleni take refuge in the upstairs of a nearby house. From the window they observe their friend Nikos, mortally wounded, stumbling through the field of sheets. A crowd, gathered at the foot of the habitations, looks on, as Nikos, waving goodbye, collapses on the ground.By the rainy, gray morning, a small crowd of well-wishers has assembled on a quay to send Markos and his group off to America. Alexis is to join them on the long-dreamed voyage. A large ocean liner is waiting some distance away to take them to the ""promised land."" Eleni and the children are also present to see him off. She has knitted him a red sweater, which she did not have time to finish. Alexis grabs a thread from it and undoes the knitting as he boards the small boat that takes him to the ocean liner. Eventually, the thread breaks off.A letter from Alexis, written on March 5, 1937 from Ellis Island, reaches Eleni. It describes Alexis' disappointment in the ""promised land."" Soon after, as Eleni is writing back to her husband, there are knocks on the door. She is arrested by the Fascists and taken into the night to a prison, most likely because of her association with the Leftist musicians. She is liberated as WWII commences with the Italian invasion of Greece, followed by the Nazi occupation. Eleni returns to her house in Thessaloniki only to discover that it has burned down, along with the whole neighborhood. She gets a letter from Alexis dated October 30, 1940, telling her that he has joined the US Army in order to become a citizen, which will allow him to bring Eleni and the children to America.Soon after the end of WWII, the Greek civil war begins. Eleni has again been thrown in jail for harboring a wounded partisan. We see her in 1949, leaving the jail, as the warden gives her a letter from Alexis, written four years earlier, from Okinawa, the last battle in the Pacific. The letter had been found next to ""the body of a dead soldier,"" later identified as Alexis. Eleni is being liberated so that she can go and claim the body of her dead son, Yannis, who had joined the Government's side against the Communist partisans. Eleni collapses in the field where Yannis' body is laying, and she is taken in by some old women of her old village who are now remorseful about the way they treated Eleni's family. One of these women (Toula Stathopoulos) tells her about the death of Eleni's other son, Yorgis. She takes Eleni to a spot where she witnessed the two brothers, fighting for opposing sides, briefly reunited as Yannis brought the erroneous news of the death of their mother to his brother. The scene of the meeting between the two brothers is not recounted by the old lady, but through a shift in time, we actually the two brothers' brief, poignant meeting. The old lady tells Eleni that Yorgis's body is still where he fell in Spyros' old house, now practically swallowed up by the waters, in the middle of the lake. Eleni rows a boat to the house, and collapses on her son's body. She rises from his body, releasing several heart-wrenching screams of grief. She is now totally alone in the world.

"The film centers on Griffith (Dan Montgomery, Jr.) who has lived all his life in the fictional town of Pine Apple, Mississippi. He spends most of his time barefoot on the red dirt and has a hobby of tracing the epitaphs on headstones. He was orphaned as a child when his parents drowned inside their car in the river under mysterious circumstances. He was raised by his eccentric Aunt Summer (Karen Black) and his Uncle Charlie.Summer is mentally unstable and agoraphobic, apparently a result of the death of Griffith's parents. She and her only other living sister, Lynn Thomas (Peg O'Keef), have avoided each other for years for unknown reasons. Charlie (who died of cancer when Griffith was 14) once regularly sent Summer off to a mental asylum, being unable to deal with her eccentric behavior. She resumed living in the house after Charlie's death, cared for by Griffith and the family matriarch, Lily Mae.Griffith's only other close relationship is with Lynn's daughter, his first cousin Emily (Aleksa Palladino), with whom he also has occasional sexual relationships.The film is set shortly after the death of Lily Mae, when Griffith becomes solely responsible for caring for his aunt. Griffith resents this, feeling trapped in his environment and longing to leave. Emily does not want him to leave. She accuses Griffith of wanting to abandon her and his responsibilities to Aunt Summer. Emily herself has no wish to leave Pine Apple, even though her own mother practically pushes her to.Griffith is nevertheless determined to leave. He starts cleaning up the cottage previously used by Lily Mae with the intention of renting it out. A day after he hangs the 'For Rent' sign, a stranger from Louisiana arrives and inquires about the cottage. He introduces himself as Lee Todd (Walton Goggins). Griffith agrees to let Lee stay in the cottage for free in return for helping him finish painting it, despite the objections of both Summer and Emily.The two quickly become friends. They paint a barn roof with Emily's name and phone number and they start building a giant replica of a pincushion in memory of Lily Mae. Griffith is intrigued by Lee's experiences during his travels. Lee, in turn, urges Griffith to leave Pine Apple and see the world. He offers to take Griffith with him. Griffith agrees and they make a blood oath.Emily senses the growing closeness between the two. Feeling left out, she starts spending time with Summer. The two develop an unlikely friendship. Summer sees herself in Emily, senses her doubts and her repressed desire to leave. She also urges Emily to leave Pine Apple, but Emily dismisses this. Emily also voices her suspicions to Summer that Griffith and Lee were becoming more than friends. Summer admits to having the same suspicions but does not want to interfere, believing that she had already stood in Griffith's way enough.Emily confronts Lee and tries to convince him to leave Griffith alone. Lee refuses, telling her that he believes it's best for Griffith to leave Pine Apple.Summer thrives in the company of Emily, who convinces her to finally get out of the house and try to get over her agoraphobia. Driving out on country roads, they chance upon Lee and Griffith, who have just finished building the replica of Lily Mae's pincushion in the middle of a field. The sight of it finally triggers closure on Summer's part, setting her on the path to recovery.While bathing in the river that afternoon, Lee tells Griffith that they should be leaving soon for Texas. Griffith agrees but asks for one more week to prepare. That night, Griffith asks permission from Summer to leave. Summer encourages him. She asks him not to worry about her but she also betrays guilt over Griffith's childhood, something Griffith can still not understand.Emily catches Lee putting away stuff for storage and learns that Lee and Griffith are leaving together. She confronts Griffith and confesses that she loves him, the reason she didn't want to leave. Griffith tells her it isn't enough anymore and that he has to leave.Summer asks Emily to drive her to her sister. During their conversation the reasons for their alienation became clear. The death of Griffith's parents was not an accident. Summer had been having an affair with her late sister's husband and Griffith is actually Summer's son. Although Summer gave him up to her sister (who couldn't conceive), it didn't prevent the eventual breakdown of her sister's marriage. They gave Griffith back to Summer and committed suicide by driving off a bridge. Lynn blames Summer for their sister's death. Summer is wracked by guilt over it but is still thankful that she got to take care of Griffith after all.Meanwhile, Emily confronts Griffith for the final time, openly accusing him of being gay. Griffith becomes angry and unthinkingly tries to rape her in an attempt to prove his heterosexuality. He stops himself in time and runs away into the rain. Griffith finds Lee and accuses him of lying to him about his intentions. Lee tells him what has been obvious, that deep inside Griffith knew that it was already something more than friendship. Griffith denies it vehemently and punches Lee when he tries to kiss him. Griffith goes home and shuts himself in his room.The following day, Lee visits Emily to say goodbye. He finds Emily packing her things. She has decided to leave Pine Apple for New Orleans. They finally admit to each other that they both love Griffith. Before Lee leaves, Emily assures him that Griffith does love him.After Lee has left town, Summer finally admits to Griffith that she is his real mother. Griffith is initially incredulous but eventually believes her. In doing so, he finally realizes he doesn't need to run away after all, that he actually belongs to Pine Apple. He sets fire to the giant pincushion, which was to him a symbol of his desire to leave. He also makes up with Emily before she leaves for New Orleans, after bidding a tearful goodbye to Summer.Lee unexpectedly returns shortly after. Griffith receives him warmly but they carefully avoid the subject of their previous fight. As Lee is turning away to leave for the final time, Griffith finally gets the courage to admit that he loves him back and kisses him. Lee drives him back to Summer's house.Griffith opts to remain in Pine Apple with Summer. He and Lee read a poem inscribed on Lily Mae's headstone to each other and part with the implication of keeping in touch.Forever and a day and the blood of man, stained red the dirt of the Mississippi land. And in this journey we go, but in this place well stay. If only in the heart, where memory of love, eternally remains."
"Red Dirt offers the story of a young man's search to belong in this sublime expression of love and reconciliation. At only twenty, Griffith is struggling with the responsibilities of caring for his unwell aunt, grieving the loss of their family's matriarch, and his own dreams of leaving Pine Apple.

"""Mother and Son"" (1997) is a love story, not of the ""Romeo and Juliette"" or ""Tristan and Isolde"" type, but rather regarding the profound emotional ties that exist between a mother and her son. The film calls for amazing optical effects and sounds in order to develop a cinematographic poetry. ""Mother and Son"" is the first part of a trilogy that has for its subject matter the study of the drama in human relationships. It is followed by ""Father and Son"" (2003), and by ""Two Brothers and a Sister,"" the final installment, which is in its preliminary filming stage.The film opens on two human forms, which soon reveal themselves to be that of a young man and a frail, old woman. They recline in a silence penetrated only by whispers and indistinguishable noises. The young man is the son (Alexei Ananishnov) who is taking care of his exhausted, sick mother (Gudrun Geyer). Her illness is undefined and from time to time causes her great pain as she gasps for air. Her son combs her hair, feeds her, covers her with a coat, and takes her in his arms. She is totally dependent on him as he himself was once totally dependent on her. As the film progresses, the son carries his mother on a long journey, from her sick-bed to her death-bed. It is a circular motion, which travels a long walk through a dream-like landscape in the countryside, along winding dirt roads. At each of their brief stops on the journey is a moment of contemplation, caresses, and tender murmurs. These soft murmurs tell of the mother's love for her son when she was nurturing him and of the son's love for his mother as he opens for her the mysterious path to her death. They progress under the leaden and luminous ski of the Baltic, in totally isolated landscapes. From time to time, there is a far away train or a sail on the sea, emphasizing further their isolation from the rest of the worldThey return to the house. The son tenderly lowers his mother into her bed, which now seems to resemble a coffin. Both know that the end is nearing, although he tries to reassure her to the contrary. He leaves her for a time and goes for a long, solitary walk. When he returns, his mother may have died."

An eager and idealistic young attorney defends an Alcatraz prisoner accused of murdering a fellow inmate. The extenuating circumstances: his client had just spent over three years in solitary confinement.::J. Spurlin
"Henri Young stole five dollars from a post office and ended up going to prison - to the most famous, or infamous, prison of them all: Alcatraz. He tried to escape, failed, and spent three years and two months in solitary confinement - in a dungeon, with no light, no heat and no toilet. Milton Glenn, the assistant warden, who was given free reign by his duty-shirking superior, was responsible for Young's treatment. Glenn even took a straight razor and hobbled Young for life. After three years and two months, Young was taken out of solitary confinement and put with the rest of the prisoners. Almost immediately, Young took a spoon and stabbed a fellow prisoner in the neck, killing him. Now, Young is on trial for murder, and if he's convicted he'll go to the gas chamber. An eager and idealistic young attorney, James Stamphill, is given this impossible case, and argues before a shocked courtroom that Young had a co-conspirator. The true murderer, he says, was Alcatraz.::J. Spurlin"

The maximum stay is supposed to be 19 days, but Henri spends years alone, cold and in complete darkness, only to emerge a madman and soon to be a murderer. The story follows a rookie lawyer attempting to prove that Alcatraz was to blame, and that Henri should not be executed.::Rob Hartill"

"In Blue Springs, Montana, high school student Roy Chutney is beginning to lose his way in life largely the result of two simultaneous events. The first is that his father, Nelson Chutney, dies. Roy hadn't seen his father much since his parents divorced and his father remarried. Nelson was run over by a train, but Roy's mother, Evangeline Chutney, with who Roy has a somewhat emotionally distant relationship, believes he committed suicide.

Gid ends up being that father figure that is missing in Roy's life. That guidance is especially important as Roy begins his first sexual relationship, with Skyla Sisco, a local barmaid.

"First viewed Clash by Night on 5/30/10 on TCM. Very good script from a play by Clifford Odets. What stood out were the parallels with A Streetcar Named Desire. Stanwyk plays the Blanche part as Mae Doyle, but she is much tougher than Blanche. Robert Ryan is excellent in the part of Earl Pfeiffer. He is direct in his approach to Mae and sees through her just as Stanley saw through Blanche. Unlike Stanley, Earl eventually reveals his vulnerability and desparate loneliness, making him and Mae (in his opinion) two of a kind. Mae is interesting because of the demands she makes on life; her past is one of dreams that didn't work out, Although the plot development is fairly predictable, there are some twists and some very good dramatic dialogue. And Marilyn Monroe shows a lot of the promise she would later realize in her more feminine turns, such as in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. If you haven't seen Clash by Night, you are missing one of the better early fifties films."

"Carlos Ramirez, 28, lives in the Dominican neighborhood of Washington Heights in New York City, where his father Eddie runs a local bodega. Carlos works in the East Village as an inker of comics, but is developing his own project he hopes to sell to a well-known publisher. Mickey Kilpatrick is the sweet-natured superintendent of their building, whose loopy dreams of becoming a professional bowler are met with only derision and confusion by his father Sean. Needless to say, both Carlos and Mickey are burning to get out of the Heights. Unlike their sons, Eddie and Sean are immigrants, or children of immigrants, who have made peace with their unfulfilled dreams. Like Carlos and Mickey, Sean and Eddie are best friends. In fact, Sean has made the mistake of lending Eddie $25,000 to cover his profligate spending. When Eddie is shot and paralyzed from the waist down during an attempted robbery, Sean prevails on Carlos to take over the store to protect his investment. For Carlos - who has been challenged by his mentor to rework a superficial comic strip into something with depth and substance - running the store is the last thing on his mind. Nevertheless, Carlos puts his artistic aspirations on hold to take over the store and care for his father. Together, they work through their mutual mistrust and their shared grief over the death of Carlos' mother Rosario. At the same time, Mickey steals money from an apartment to help himself and Carlos to fulfill their ambitions - with tragic consequences.

"On an October morning in 1951, Norman Dale (Gene Hackman) drives through the Indiana countryside. In the afternoon he arrives in the small rural town of Hickory and enters the high school. He notices, on a shelf in the hall, basketball trophies won in previous years. As the bell rings to end the school day, he encounters teacher Myra Fleener (Barbara Hershey). She realizes that Norman must be the new basketball coach and teacher of history and civics. She directs him to the office of principal Cletus Summers (Sheb Wooley), where the two men recall how they met many years ago at Buffalo State Teachers College. They had lost touch until recently, when Cletus tracked down Norman and asked him to come coach at Hickory. When Norman thanks Cletus for the opportunity, Cletus interrupts and says, ""Your slate's clean here."" They proceed to the gym, where student Jimmy Chitwood (Maris Valainis) is shooting baskets. Cletus introduces Norman, but Jimmy ignores the new coach and keeps shooting.That evening on his farm, Cletus explains to Norman that Jimmy has been strongly affected by the recent death of the previous coach, who was like a father to Jimmy. Now the young man has withdrawn from almost everything and everyone and has decided not to play basketball this season. Cletus adds that Jimmy is the best player he has ever seen. As they finish talking, Norman cryptically mentions that he hopes things will work out for him this time.That night, Norman meets some of the townsmen in the barbershop, who bombard him with questions. He tells them he last coached 12 years ago, in Ithaca, New York, and that he has been in the Navy for the past 10 years. The men voice their opinions on what Norman should do with the team. They all agree that Jimmy must rejoin the Huskers for them to have a winning season. Losing patience with all the questions and unwelcome advice, Norman cuts short the meet-and-greet and leaves.The next morning, before school begins, Myra tells Norman that Jimmy is her neighbor, and she has been looking out for him ever since his father died. She thinks it best that he stay off the team. After school, the Huskers are already practicing in the gym when Norman walks in. George Walker (Chelcie Ross), one of the townspeople Norman met in the barbershop, is leading the practice and assumes that Norman will continue allowing him to assist. When Norman brusquely makes it clear that he doesn't need any help, George storms off. As Norman gathers the seven Huskers and begins to introduce himself, Buddy (Brad Long) rudely whispers to his teammate Whit (Brad Boyle), who is standing next to him. Norman orders Buddy to leave, and Buddy convinces Whit to go with him. Jimmy is watching, unseen, at one of the far exits. Norman begins the practice and puts the Huskers through drills of passing, running in place, and dribbling while weaving between chairs; they never scrimmage. Norman explains, ""There's more to the game than shooting. There's fundamentals and defense."" He also wants them to be in top physical condition because, if they continue to have only five players, substitutions and rest during games will be impossible. On the second day of practice, several townspeople walk in to observe; they've heard about Norman's unusual drills. Rollin Butcher (Robert Swan), Whit's father, brings in his son and has him apologize for walking out the day before. Rollin then tells the other men to leave, because the coach doesn't want them there.One day, as Cletus and Norman eat pie at the diner downtown, in comes Wilbur ""Shooter"" Flatch (Dennis Hopper), stumbling a bit and wearing a worn-out coat. Shooter, a former basketball player, describes for Norman how he almost led his team to victory in the 1933 sectional game of the tournament on a last-second shot. When Shooter asks Cletus in a low voice if he can borrow some spare change, Shooter's son, Everett (David Neidorf), who has been sitting in another part of the diner, walks up. He insists that Shooter give back the money and then escorts his father outside.One afternoon, as Jimmy shoots baskets at the school's outdoor court, Norman approaches him and asks why he wasn't in class that day, but Jimmy doesn't answer. Norman goes on to tell him that he believes Jimmy has a special talent that belongs only to him. Norman concludes by stating matter-of-factly that he doesn't care if Jimmy rejoins the team, and he walks away. From a window in the school, Myra has been watching them. Entering the school, Norman runs into Myra, who tells him to leave Jimmy alone. They begin arguing about Jimmy's future. She says she thinks Jimmy could receive an academic college scholarship if he concentrates on his studies instead of athletics. She doesn't want him to get stuck in Hickory, where the high point of his life will have been his days playing high school basketball. She doesn't understand why the townspeople place so much emphasis on the sport. She also is suspicious of Norman, wondering why someone like him has moved to Hickory, a town unaccustomed to seeing outsiders. She believes he might be running away from something.At the beginning of an afternoon pep session meant to showcase this season's Huskers, several people in the crowd begin chanting ""We want Jimmy!"" Norman silences them and defends his six-man squad, concluding, ""This is your team.""In the locker room before the first home game, Norman reminds the team what he taught them in practice: they must pass at least four times before attempting a shot. After Rev. Doty (Wil Dewitt) offers a prayer, a kneeling Strap (Scott Summers) continues praying silently, even after everyone else has departed the locker room and begun warming up. Norman tells team manager Ollie (Wade Schenck) that he will substitute for Strap in the game until Strap finishes praying. To Ollie's relief, Strap shows up right before tip-off. Early in the game, the Huskers quickly fall behind, and some of the townspeople in the crowd start yelling at the Huskers to shoot. Jimmy watches from the top row. Myra and Shooter are in the crowd as well. At halftime, Norman chews out the players, again telling them to always make at least four passes before shooting. In the second half, an impatient Rade (Steve Hollar), feeling pressure from the fans, decides to disobey the rule and shoot if he's open. Even though he makes these shots, Norman benches him. Moments later, after Merle (Kent Poole) fouls out, Rade attempts to reenter the game. Norman orders him to sit back down, even though this means Hickory will have only four players on the floor for the rest of the game. The fans yell and boo, but Shooter smiles with amazement. In the locker room after the loss, Norman asks the boys to consider whether they really want to be on the team. He reminds them that his instructions to them are ""the law, absolutely and without discussion!""The next week, Norman encounters Myra and her sports-loving mother, Opal (Fern Persons), outside the feed-and-grain store. Opal invites him to Sunday dinner because she wants to talk basketball. Arriving well before dinnertime, Norman helps the two women grind sorghum on their farm. When he gets a chance to talk to Myra alone, she tells him a bit about her family and past, including the fact that she left Hickory for a few years but later returned. When he asks her if she's ever thought about getting married, she declines to answer, explaining that in Hickory, people tend to mind their own business.A few days later, Shooter unexpectedly calls on Norman at home and offers him unsolicited advice about the Huskers' upcoming game against Cedar Knob. Norman can tell from Shooter's remarks that he is quite knowledgeable about basketball history and strategy and has valuable insights into Hickory's opponents. That weekend, the Huskers travel in the team bus, owned and driven by Preacher Purl (Michael Sassone), Strap's father, to their first away game at Cedar Knob. The game is a tough one, with lots of physical contact. A drunk Shooter is present. Norman begins arguing with one of the referees, and then the Cedar Knob coach, and then one of the Cedar Knob players, who pokes Norman in the chest. Norman slaps his hand away, and Rade decks the player with a left hook. The rest of the boys begin scuffling. Norman and Rade are ejected, leaving a distressed-looking Cletus to take over as coach.The next day, Norman visits Cletus, who is suffering from heart trouble and has been ordered to be on bed rest for a while. After that, Norman goes to see Shooter at his dilapidated cabin in the woods. He offers to make Shooter his assistant coach, on one condition: he must remain sober. Offended and embarrassed, Shooter asks Norman to leave. However, at the next home game, Shooter surprises the players and perplexes the townspeople by showing up in a suit and tie, ready to accept the coach's offer.The next week, after class, Everett tells Norman he has doubts about his father's being the assistant coach, because he's a drunk who will do something stupid. After that, Myra comes in and informs Norman that a town meeting has been scheduled for Saturday, at which Hickory residents will decide if he will be removed as coach.During that Friday's game, Norman receives a technical foul and, after arguing with the referee, is thrown out. An anxious Shooter is forced to take over. The next day, Myra finds Norman standing alone along the fencerow on Cletus's farm, lost in thought. She tells him about an old newspaper article she found at the library, which describes how Norman was suspended from college coaching after he hit one of his players. Myra then says she appreciates how Norman is trying to help Shooter and how he hasn't pressured Jimmy to rejoin the team.At the town meeting that night, which takes place in the church, Norman gives a brief speech in which he defends himself. Myra then steps up to the lectern and prepares to tell the crowd what she has discovered about the coach. But she abruptly changes her mind and tearfully tells them she thinks it would be a mistake to let him go. After the residents vote on Norman's dismissal, as George finishes counting the ballots, Jimmy enters the church. He announces he has decided to rejoin the team, but only if Norman is allowed to stay. George indicates that the majority of votes are for dismissal, but Opal calls for a revote. This time most of the residents vote for Norman to stay.With Jimmy on the team, the reenergized Huskers go on a winning streak. About halfway through the season, Norman counsels Shooter, who is struggling with sobriety, that if he can't resist the urge to drink, he should go to the hospital to dry out. Shooter promises not to fall off the wagon if Norman will promise not to be ejected from any more games. At the next home game, Norman gets himself thrown out on purpose so that Shooter can take over as coach and hopefully gain some confidence. Shooter has the team run the picket fence play, and they win. Everett is proud of his father.At the end of the regular season, tournament play begins. At the start of Hickory's sectional game against Terhune, Shooter is nowhere to be found. During the game, he suddenly shows up and stumbles onto the court, drunk and yelling. After Rollin leads him away, a technical foul is called on Hickory. Everett becomes angry and distracted. When one of the Terhune players shoves Jimmy during a layup, Everett retaliates by punching him. As the two continue fighting, the other players from both teams join in. Everett is pushed hard into a trophy case in the adjoining hallway, cutting his shoulder badly. The fight breaks up and the game continues, with Hickory winning by 2 points.The next day, Norman and Everett go looking for Shooter, who has been missing since he was tossed out of the sectional. They find him lying unconscious in the snow-covered woods. Shooter is soon admitted to the hospital's alcohol rehabilitation unit, where Norman visits him.That weekend, reporters mob Norman and the team as they enter the Jasper gym for the regional game against Linton. In the locker room, Norman advises the Huskers to think about this game only and not to worry about progressing in the tournament. They should focus on the fundamentals, not on winning or losing.With the score tied at 50 with 2:30 to go, one of the Linton players hits Everett in his injured shoulder, causing the stitches to pull out. At first Norman wants Everett to ignore the pain and keep playing, but then he changes his mind and takes him out. Strap, not one of the better players, enters the game and immediately scores several points. When Buddy fouls out, only Ollie is left to substitute; he reluctantly enters the game. With Hickory up by 1, Ollie is fouled. He shoots awkwardly and misses his free throw. Linton then scores. Ollie is fouled as he shoots and misses. Two Linton players try to intimidate Ollie before he attempts his free throws, but Merle steps forward to offer encouragement. Using the same unusual underhand shooting style as before, Ollie makes both his free tosses, winning the game and sending the Huskers to the state finals.The following week, after Norman receives a haircut from Opal at her home, he notices Myra working in the muddy garden. They go on a walk. He asks her if she would like to go to a movie sometime, but she responds by bringing up the incident in which he hit his college player. He says he can't really explain or understand why he did it. They kiss.A few days later, Norman and the Huskers encounter a group of reporters gathered in the Hickory gym, waiting to interview Norman about the upcoming state-finals game. That same week, Everett visits Shooter in the hospital.On the morning of the state finals, Norman and the team enter an empty Butler Fieldhouse and are awed by its enormity. Norman has the Huskers measure the length of the free-throw lane and the distance from the rim to the floor. He reminds them that these dimensions are the same as those in the Hickory gym.In the locker room that night, Norman reviews game strategy with the team. He then tells them that the last few months have been special for him. He asks the Huskers if they would like to say anything. Merle wants to win for all the small schools that never had a chance to get to the state finals. Everett wants to win for his dad. Buddy wants to win for their coach. After Rev. Doty and Preacher Purl offer appropriate Bible verses, the Huskers take the floor. They struggle early in the game against the taller and more muscular South Bend Central Bears. But they regroup and begin to close the scoring gap until they are tied with the Bears at 40. After Rade intercepts a South Bend pass, Hickory controls the ball. With 19 seconds on the clock, Hickory calls time-out. Norman tells his players that, because the Bears will expect Jimmy to take the last shot, the Huskers will use Jimmy as a decoy while Merle attempts the final basket. Seeing the boys' uncomfortable reaction to his plan, Norman demands to know what's wrong. They say nothing until Jimmy declares, ""I'll make it."" Norman hesitates but then realizes that entrusting Jimmy with Hickory's last chance to score is indeed the best course of action. Play resumes, and with only 2 seconds left, Jimmy launches his shot, which sails through the net. The Hickory fans erupt in celebration and spill onto the floor.The final scene shows a grade-school-age boy shooting baskets in a quiet, empty Hickory gym as the camera zooms in on a team photo of the state-champion Huskers hanging on the wall.

Badland is a must for everyone. The film is harrowing and emotionally draining. It certainly packs a punch. Jamie Draven acts his part superbly as an anguished and desperate man- and his American accent is even passable! There is very much an atmosphere of claustrophobia and desolation running through the story that it is quite spine chilling in its effect.I believe this will have quite an impact on audiences on release. The only criticism might be that it is too long- there were scenes that could have been shortened. But the overall effect was spellbinding. Congratulations to Badland Films for a believable story brought to us with all the inherent pain and guilt that the main character portrays. His pain is deafening. Congratulations to Jamie Draven too- an ideal choice.

"A privileged, free-spirited young girl tries to adapt to life in a strict boarding school in this charming, critically acclaimed children's fantasy. Adapting a novel by Frances Hodgson Burnett, also the author of The Secret Garden, the film shifts the story's setting to World War I. 10 year-old Sara Crewe (Liesel Matthews) has been left in a respected New York City boarding school while her British father heads overseas to fight. Filled with wild stories and a playful attitude, the unconventional Sara becomes popular with her classmates but quickly comes into conflict with the harsh headmistress, Miss Minchin (Eleanor Bron), who attempts to quash the child's individuality. The young girl's situation takes a serious turn for the worse when she unexpectedly receives word of her father's death, and, suddenly impoverished, is forced into life as a servant. Treated as a lesser class of person by her former companions, Sara instead befriends her fellow servants and turns to the power of imagination in order to maintain hope for the future."

"Glen or Glenda tells two stories. One is about Glen (Edward D. Wood Jr.), who secretly dresses as a woman but is afraid to tell his fiancée. The other is about Alan ('Tommy' Haynes), a pseudohermaphrodite who undergoes a painful operation to become a woman.Both stories are told by Dr. Alton (Timothy Farrell). There's a second narrator, called the Scientist (Bela Lugosi), whose commentary on the action contains more philosophical pronouncements than facts. The movie will also have flashbacks-within-flashbacks and a strange dream sequence.The introductory title card reads: ""In the making of this film, which deals with a strange and curious subject, no punches have been pulled--no easy way out has been taken. Many of the smaller parts are portrayed by persons who actually are, in real life, the character [sic] they portray on the screen. This is a picture of stark realism---taking no sides---but giving you the facts---All the facts---as they are today....You are society---JUDGE YE NOT.....""When the first scene opens, we see the Scientist sitting in a large chair with some kind of netting over it. He is shot from the shoulders up as he looks down. The shadow of the camera falls on the right side (his right) of the chair. Behind him, and above his head, we see three shelves. The top shelf has two skulls on either end and a lion's head in the middle. The second has a shrunken head on the left side (his left). Sticking out from the back of the chair is a long, cylindrical object with a round head.The camera pulls back. The shadow of the camera disappears from the chair and from the wall behind the Scientist. We see more of the room. On the Scientist's left is a skeleton hanging from the ceiling. On his right is a figure, also hanging from the ceiling, that looks like a native African in a loin cloth. We hear the sound of a violent wind.The Scientist is reading a large book. He closes it and looks up at us. He speaks: ""Man's constant probing of things unknown, drawing from the endless reaches of time, brings to light many startling things. Startling? Because they seem new? Sudden! But most are not new. The signs of the ages!""A shot of the sky as lightning tears through it. We dissolve to the Scientist mixing chemicals in test tubes. He pours the results into a beaker and is happy with the result. ""A life has begun!"" he declares. He laughs.A busy city street. Via a trick shot we the Scientist on the top half of the screen as he looks down. ""People!"" he spits. ""All going somewhere! All with their own thoughts! Their own ideas! All with their own personalities! One is wrong because he does right. One is right because he does wrong. Pull the string! Dance to that which one is created for!"" He looks ready to pounce, but then laughs and then sighs ironically.""A new day is begun,"" he continues. We hear the sound of a baby. ""A new life is begun."" A shot of an ambulance and the wail of its siren cut him off; but he reappears, superimposed on the screen. ""A life is ended.""We meet a corpse lying on a daybed. The corpse is of a man wearing women's clothing. Insp. Warren (Lyle Talbot), who is investigating this case, quickly sees this is a case of suicide. A note left near the body confirms it.This note, read aloud in a voice-over, says, ""The records will tell the story. I was put in jail recently. Why? Because I, a man, was caught on the street wearing women's clothing. This was my fourth arrest for the same act. In life, I must continue wearing them. Therefore, it would only be a matter of time until my next arrest. This is the only way. Let my body rest in death forever in the things I cannot wear in life.""Later, Insp. Warren seeks to know more about transvestites and transsexuals. He goes to a psychiatrist, Dr. Alton, for the facts.By this time the story has hit the papers. ""Let us get our stories straight,"" says Dr. Alton. ""You're referring to the suicide of the transvestite?""Warren replies, ""If that's the word you men of medical science use for a man who wears woman's clothing, yes.""""Yes, in cold, technical language, that's the word, as unfriendly and as vicious as it may sound. However, in actuality it's not an unfriendly word. Nor is it vicious when you know the people to whom it pertains.""Insp. Warren brings up the case of a man's recent sex change, which Dr. Alton was involved in. ""[Will an] operation do these people any good?""""Some cases yes, some no. [...] You can only fully understand the sex change by taking two entirely different cases, two men with exactly the same background from childhood to manhood and onto their own decisions and destinations.""Insp. Warren says, ""I'd like to hear the story to the fullest.""Dr. Alton rejoins, while turning to us in close-up, ""Only the infinity of the depths of a man's mind can really tell the story.""The picture goes blurry. We cut to flashes of lightning and sounds of thunder. Presently we're looking down at the Scientist who squints at us and says, ""Dr. Alton, a young man though he is, speaks the words of the all-wise."" He goes on to say, ""No one can really tell the story.  Mistakes are made. But there is no mistaking the thoughts in a man's mind. The story is begun!""Now we see Glen, dressed as Glenda, walking down the street. He's wearing a skirt and an angora sweater, while looking into a shop window. Dr. Alton (not the Scientist) says in a voice-over, ""One might say, 'There but for the grace of God go I.'""We see a newspaper with the headline, ""WORLD SHOCKED BY SEX CHANGE."" ""Why,"" asks Dr. Alton, ""is the world shocked by this headline?""""Airplanes!"" we hear an old woman say in a voice-over, as we watch a plane dropping cargo. ""Humph! Why, it's against the Creator's will. If the Creator wanted us to fly, he'd have given us wings.""Dr. Alton says, ""But we fly. Maybe some of you may still remember an even sillier remark.""""Automobiles!"" says an old man in a voice-over, as we see a field worker in a sombrero. ""Bah! They scare the hosses [sic]! If the creator hadda meant for us to roam around the countryside, we'da been born with wheels!""""Silly?"" Dr. Alton chides. ""Certainly. We were not born with wings. We were not born with wheels. But in modern [sic] world of today, it's an accepted fact that we must have them. So we have corrected that which nature has not given us. Strangely enough, nature has given us all these things. We just had to learn how to put nature's elements together for our use, that's all. Yet the world is shocked by a sex change!""We see Glen (as Glenda) at home. ""Give this man satin undies, a dress, a sweater and a skirt,"" Alton continues, ""or even the lounging outfit he has on, and he's the happiest individual in the world. He can work better, think better. He can play better. And he can be more of a credit to his community and his government because he is happy. These things are his comfort.""But why the wig and makeup?"" Alton continues. ""He dares to enter the street dressed in the clothes he so much desires to wear, but only if he really appears female: the long hair, the makeup, the clothing, the actual contours of a girl.""Do transvestites want to change their bodies? ""Many of them simply want to change the clothing they wear to that [which] is worn by the opposite sex.""We meet Barbara (Dolores Fuller), Glen's fiancée. She and Glen seem happy together, but Glenda casts a shadow over his mind. Barbara is blissfully ignorant, but she does notice that Glen needs his nails trimmed. They're almost as long and as pretty as hers.Dr. Alton continues his lecture: ""Modern man is a hardworking human. Throughout the day his mind and his muscles are busy at building the modern world and its business administration. His clothing is rough, coarse, starched, according to the specifications of his accepted job.""At home,"" he continues, ""what does modern man have to look forward to for his body comfort? The things provided for his home, a wool or flannel robe, his feet encased in the same thick, tight-fitting leather that his shoes are made of. These are the things provided for his home comfort.""Dr. Alton has an explanation for baldness: ""Men wear hats, which cut off the blood flow to their heads."" His statistic? ""Seven out of ten men wear hats. ... Seven out of ten men are bald.""Just for comparison, let's go native. Back to the animal instinct."" We see African natives, beating drums and dancing. Surrounding them are skulls affixed to posts. The men have fancy masks. The women are unadorned.""There in the lesser civilized part of the world, it's the male who adorns himself with the fancy objects, such as paints, frills and masks. The true instinct. The animal instinct. Bird and animal life. Is it not so that it's the male who is the fancy one? Could it be that the male was meant to attract the attention of the female?""What's so wrong about that?"" he asks as a male carries off a female. ""Where is the animal instinct in modern civilization? Female has the fluff and the finery, as specified by those who design and sell.""Little Miss Female,"" says Dr. Alton, ""you should feel quite proud of the situation. You of course realize that it's predominantly men who design your clothes, your jewelry, your makeup, your hair styling, your perfume. But life, even though its changes are slow, moves on. There's no law against wearing such apparel on the street, as long as it can be distinguished that man is man and woman is woman.""But if man dresses as woman? We ridicule him, says Dr. Alton. We see a woman reading the newspaper with the ubiquitous headline, ""WORLD SHOCKED BY SEX CHANGE."" The paper is covering her face. When she sets it down, it turns out ""she"" is a man (Conrad Brooks) wearing a dress, earrings and a long, thick beard.""You're doing it now,"" he says. ""Laughing. Yet, it's not a situation to be laughed at.""Dr. Alton turns back to Glen. Young Glen wore his sister's dress to a Halloween party and won first prize. ""Then one day,"" says Dr. Alton, as we see Glen lounging in his sister's clothes, ""it wasn't Halloween any longer.""Glen is a transvestite, but he is not a homosexual,"" he continues. ""Transvestism is the term given by medical science to those persons who desperately wish to wear the clothing of the opposite sex, yet whose sex life in all instances remains quite normal.""Barbara starts to realize that something is wrong. She asks Glen, with more irony than she knows, if the trouble is ... another woman?We abruptly cut to a shot of stampeding buffalo. Then we dissolve to the Scientist crying, ""Pull the string! Pull the string! A mistake is made. The story must be told!"" (The meaning of this brief scene is open to interpretation.)Glen goes to his friend Johnny (Charlie Crafts) for advice. Johnny is also a transvestite, whose wife divorced him when she found him wearing her clothes. Johnny advises Glen to tell Barbara about ""Glenda.""Dr. Alton explains that Glen should have seen a competent psychiatrist. He notes that some transvestites take their secrets to the grave. We proceed to a flashback-within-a-flashback in which Dr. Alton rhetorically asks ""Glenda"" if she remembers the time, a year before, when Glen and Barbara had accepted each other. We see Glen and Barbara accepting each other.We return from the flashback-within-a-flashback to the flashback. Glenda rushes into her house and then collapses as we hear a thunderclap. We dissolve into the Scientist delivering a cryptic warning: """"Bevare! Bevare! Bevare of the big green dragon that sits on your doorstep. He eats little boys! Puppy dog tails and big, fat snails! Bevare! Take care! Bevare!""Next is a dream sequence.We see shots of Glen (dressed as Glenda) alternating with those of Barbara. Glenda's hand gestures indicate that she wants Barbara to draw nearer. Barbara is in mental agony, which she indicates by holding her head in her hands and then dropping to the floor and slapping it with her palms. Glenda leaves the frame and the picture goes black.An effect, that's partly an iris out and partly a wipe, reveals Barbara struggling underneath something that looks like a tree. Glenda tries to pull it off her, but then she disappears, leaving Barbara to struggle alone. Glen appears and manages to pull off the tree and save her.We dissolve to a preacher. Barbara and Glen enter from behind the camera, facing the preacher and away from us, the audience. The preacher opens his book and then looks to his left. Satan appears. The preacher reaches toward Satan who gives him a ring. (Presumably, that is. Glen is obscuring the view.) The ceremony continues as Satan nods approvingly. Glen and Barbara kiss and walk toward the camera.We dissolve to the Scientist. ""Tell me, tell me, dragon! Do you eat little boys? Puppy dog tails and big, fat snails?""We dissolve to a close-up of Glen, lit from underneath, as smoke rises from behind him. He looks up at us, shaking violently. A child's voice says, ""Puppy dog tails! Puppy dog tails! Puppy dog tails! Everything nice. Everything nice. Ha, ha, ha! Puppy dog tails!""We abruptly cut to the Scientist. We alternate between shots of him, looking disgusted and outraged, shots of Glen looking frightened, and shots of women employed in various sado-masochistic activities. Both Glen and Bela seem to be reacting to the women.The vignettes: A half-dressed woman is whipped by a shirtless man. A woman stands at a pole, inviting some unseen person to come closer, as her dress nearly falls off. A woman in a flower-print dress seems bothered by it, so she rips it off. A woman performs a semi-dance routine as she slowly lifts up her dress to reveal her underwear. A woman with her mouth gagged frees another gagged woman whose hands are tied to a bamboo pole that's set across her shoulders. A woman writhes on her couch in ecstasy. A second woman sneaks up and ties her hands together and then gags her. A brunette sits at her vanity combing her hair. Later, she's nearly nude on her couch as she writhes around on it. A man with a pointed beard appears and rapes her. The vignettes end with a shot of Lugosi giving an expression of amused resignation.(Note: the sequence in italics is missing from some prints. Originally, the producer inserted this soft-core pornography into the film against the director's wishes. Ed Wood had nothing to do with it. Note also that in some prints the dream has a bit more footage than what is described here, and it runs in a slightly different order.)Then we're back to the dream sequence. We see Glen in his house, only the furniture has been turned upside down and the fireplace is tilted, giving the place an air of surreality. A sinister voice (not the Scientist's) says, ""Big green dragons and big fat snails. Beware! Take care!""""I'm a girl!"" says the smug little child's voice. Then, ""I'm not! You're a boy! A puppy dog tail! Ha! Ha! Ha!""A man with a pitying expression appears out of thin air. Glen reacts with fright. Then he sees the ghostly image of a woman looking angry. ""Everything nice!"" says the disembodied girl-voice. ""Puppy dog tails, puppy dog tails, puppy dog tails!""A man and a woman, both looking censorious, fade into the scene, as they stand in front of a chalk board. An older woman, equally disapproving, pops in behind them.The girl repeats her nursery rhyme phrases as others, including Glen's sister, appear. They all point to him and surround him, lead on by Satan. When they disburse, we see that Glen is now Glenda again. He, as she, is now happy. The music is sweepingly romantic. Barbara walks in and gestures for Glenda to come near. She does, but then changes to Satan. Barbara reappears on a tipped-over love seat, and her outfits change supernaturally. She beckons Glenda again, and then laughs in Glenda's face. A sad Glenda's mental state is represented by the superimposed image of several hands with wiggling fingers. The various people reappear and laugh as they wiggle their fingers menacingly.Satan is pleased by all this. Then the male voice says, ""Beware! Beware! Beware of the big green dragon that sits on your doorstep. He eats little boys. Puppy dog tails and big fat snails. Beware, take care! Beware."" The delighted expression leaves Satan's face. The Prince of Darkness looks frightened. The dream ends with Glenda falling down and upsetting the tipped-over love seat.Glen has decided to tell Barbara of his dual personality, ""to tell her of the nighties and negligees, the sweaters and skirts, the robes and dresses, the stockings and the high-heeled shoes, the wig and the makeup. All that goes to make Glen into Glenda. He tells Barbara he cannot cheat her of the knowledge that she as his fiancée should possess. All the facts. He tells her softly, hurriedly at first, then slowly as he becomes more technical. His hands move to caress the smooth material of her angora sweater, which he has so long, so desperately wanted to put on his own body. He tells of this to her, and she looks to the sweater and to his hands. Then, when it is all over, and that much of the story he knows is told, Barbara is not sure of her own thoughts.""Glen appears to the Scientist, kneeling down with a silent plea. The Scientist, who has had no interaction with the other characters until now, makes a gesture of contempt that causes Glen to disappear.Barbara makes a decision. She takes off her angora sweater and hands it to Glen.Next we hear the story of Alan/Anne. Alan's parents always wanted a girl. Instead they got a pseudohermaphrodite, who was more boy than girl. Dr. Alton explains: ""[A] hermaphrodite is one who has the organs of both the female and the male in plain sight. A pseudohermaphrodite is one who has one perfectly formed organ of either sex, and one imperfectly formed one that's difficult to detect.""Alan's main comfort during his stay in the army was a suitcase secretly filled with women's clothes. ""Wherever Alan went,"" says Dr. Alton, ""the suitcase was sure to go.""Eventually, Alan gets a sex change. ""Never was there a whimper from [Alan],"" says Dr. Alton of Alan's surgery and hormone shots, ""because he knew that at the end of it all, he would at least be that what he had always dreamed""--a woman.The Scientist waves his hand over Alan and causes him to disappear. Then he waves his hand again and causes him to reappear as Anne.Anne does become a woman and society accepts her. But what of Glen/Glenda? Glenda, Dr. Alton explains, is a fictitious character created by Glen to take the place of the love he never received from his mother or father. Barbara ""kills off"" this character by becoming everything to him that Glenda was: his mother, little sister and wife.""But what of the hundreds of less fortunate Glens the world over?"" asks Dr. Alton.We return to the Scientist and hear the ominous rumbling of thunder. ""Yes, but what of the others, the less fortunate Glens the world over?"" he asks. ""Snips and snails and puppy dog tails!"""

"""Glen or Glenda"" tells two stories. One is about Glen, who secretly dresses as a woman but is afraid to tell his fiancée, Barbara. The other is about Alan, a pseudohermaphrodite who undergoes a painful operation to become a woman. Both stories are told by Dr. Alton, who also delivers an earnest lecture on tolerance and understanding. There is a second narrator, called the Scientist, whose commentary on the action contains more philosophical pronouncements than facts. The movie also has flashbacks-within-flashbacks and a strange dream sequence. We meet Insp. Warren, whose investigation of a transvestite's suicide leads him to learn more about men in women's clothes; Johnny, whose wife left him when she discovered what he wears when she's away; Barbara, oblivious to Glen's desire to wear her angora sweater; Satan, who invades Glen's nightmare; and others.

They soon begin to look beautiful to each other, but no one else.::Daniel Bubbeo <dbubbeo@cmp.com>"
"The lonely woman was obviously not attractive -- neither to the battle-scarred man -- nor to the audience. He, burned and scarred, was practically repulsive looking to everyone, including the audience. Once their characters began honestly interacting, however, the audience was allowed to begin to accept them as real, humble, and friendly people -- like themselves. Then, the clever director had the make-up crew begin to -- ever so slowly, practically imperceptively -- soften their features, making their formerly perceived homeliness/ugliness more and more transparent. Thus, as the characters began to fall more in love and began to see the other as the person they had so long sought after, so too, did the audience! Then the characters' true beauty became so apparent, so much as what each would have wanted the other to be, that we, audience and players alike, saw them as the most handsome people we had beheld -- in a moment to remember -- as I have these 61 years since I saw the film. I believe it is one of the most magic 'happenings' on film I've ever witnessed. It's so good to be able to recall that moment so vividly, it 'happened again!::Don Brennecke"

"First, the ""Arab"" in this movie is clearly male. Second, this is a well-produced movie based on a play. The movie makes the point that human desire for another can exist regardless of gender or sexual orientation. Paul, a Business School student ambivalent about his career destiny, has a passionate love and sexual relationship with his girlfriend. But Paul notes increasing homoerotic feelings for a male roommate, who competitively flirts with him to see how far Paul will go. Paul's girlfriend becomes aware of Paul's feelings for the roommate and makes a contest for whom Paul will have--her or the roommate. Into this mix appears a young laborer, Meric, a Frenchman, for sure, born in Paris, but close to the Algerian and Arab roots of his immigrant parents. Meric is drawn to Paul after Paul defends Meric, and the two embark on a sexual and romantic relationship that causes both to grow. Meric's and Paul's relationship reminds me of the one between Eric and Maurice in MAURICE--bridging class and racial devides. There is sort of equal time given to sexual activity of Paul with his girlfriend and with Meric--all scenes are erotic and sensitively done. There is also considerable frontal male, as well as female, nudity--which all fits with the theme of the movie. The movie is quite European in that it scoffs at notions that people can so easily be categorized as ""heterosexual"" or ""homosexual"". This point in interestingly made in the Special Features commentary by the director and stars of the movie. Salim Kechiouche, who plays Meric, does a knockout job in bringing his character to life. He is also quite charming and delightful in the Special Features section. Although this movie would appear mostly to gay men, others will find it provocative as regards its views of human sexuality, love, and desire."

A Marine captain about to embark on his fourth tour of duty, Sam is a steadfast family man married to his high school sweetheart, Grace (Natalie Portman), with whom he has two young daughters, Isabelle and Maggie (Bailee Madison, Taylor Grace Geare). The film opens with Tommy being released from jail for armed robbery, not long before Sam departs for Afghanistan in October, 2007.
Soon news comes that Sam's helicopter has crashed over the water, killing all of the Marines aboard. In reality, he and a hometown friend, Private Joe Willis (Patrick Flueger), have been taken prisoner in a mountain village. With Sam ""gone"", Tommy attempts to redeem himself in the eyes of his family by wrangling old friends to help with kitchen repairs for Grace and the kids. Grace slowly sheds her previous resentment towards her brother-in-law.
As months pass, Grace and Tommy bond over their mutual mourning, culminating in a passionate fireside kiss. They regret it afterward, and do not take this attraction any further, though Tommy continues to win the favor of his nieces. Meanwhile, Sam and Joe are abused and tortured by terrorists, forced to make videotaped dismissals of the military and their mission, though only Joe cracks. The captors eventually deem him useless and force Sam, at gunpoint, to beat Joe to death with a lead pipe. He does so and reacts angrily. Sometime later, Sam is rescued.
Sam returns home, clearly traumatized by his experience. He drifts through encounters in a cold, paranoid daze, refuses to explain to his family what happened while he was in Afghanistan, and lies to Joe's widow that he does not know how Joe died. He also believes Tommy and Grace had a sexual relationship in his absence. During Maggie's birthday party, a resentful and jealous Isabelle claims that Sam's paranoid assumptions are true: that Tommy and Grace slept together. Sam becomes enraged, destroying the newly remodeled kitchen with a crow bar and pulling a pistol on Tommy who arrives and tries to calm his brother's violent tantrum. The police arrive, and after a frantic confrontation in which Sam holds the gun up against his head and nearly commits suicide, Sam surrenders.
Sam is admitted to a mental hospital. Grace visits him and tells him that if he does not tell her what is tormenting him, he will lose her forever. Faced with this decision, Sam finally opens up about the source of his pain, confiding in her that he killed Joe and they embrace. A letter between husband and wife is read in voice over, with Sam wondering if he will be able to continue living a normal life."

"US Marine Captain Sam Cahill is well respected, not only by his colleagues but also by his family, especially his ex-Marine father, Hank Cahill. Although he is also loved by his family - his high school sweetheart wife Grace, and their two young daughters, Isabelle and Maggie - they, Isabelle in particular, do not like his frequent absences. Coinciding with the imminent and only latest of his deployments to Afghanistan is the release from prison of his brother, Tommy Cahill. Grace does not much like Tommy, and Hank feels Tommy has not earned his respect, which does not change by Tommy's actions post-prison. Shortly into this tour of duty, the Cahills learn that Sam has been killed in action. Largely because of Grace's grief, Tommy finally comes to the realization that he needs to become a responsible adult, filling the role vacated by Sam in more ways than one. In their mutual grief, Tommy and Grace fall into each others arms - which does not go any farther than a single kiss - and the girls see in their Uncle Tommy the father that they don't have in Sam, namely one who is constantly present in their lives. This new life changes when they all learn that Sam was not killed, but was taken captive in Afghanistan and now rescued. Sam's return leads to a difficult transition for all concerned, not only because of Grace and the family having settled into a life without him and with Tommy, but also because of the trauma experienced by Sam in Afghanistan in relation to how he sees Grace and Tommy together.::Huggo"

Krzystof also denies the existence of the soul, calling it an alternate easier explanation for life and death.At the school, a TV news channel is doing a report on the poor quality of milk being provided at public schools. The crew also shoots the children including Pawel running around the campus. Later that day Pawel's auntie Irena Maja Komorowska comes to pick him up from the school. Back at home, he shows Irena how he can open and close the doors, turn the tap water on and off using the computer. Pawel also shows her the program he has created to know what his mother, who is living in another country, is doing. Irena asks him if the program knows what his mother is dreaming but the computer is unable to give an answer, to which she replies that it is simple, she is dreaming of Pawel. Pawel believes his father's computer would be able to answer what her mother is dreaming.At her aunt's home, Pawel discusses the thoughts about life, death, and religion lingering in his mind. Irena explains him the purpose and meaning of life, which is a gift. She also tries explaining to him that her brother (Krzysztof) sees life more rationally, where everything can be counted and measured.Pawel goes to a chess game teaming up with his father against a chess master. Pawel brilliantly identifies their opponent's next moves and is able to defeat her. Later after arriving at their apartment, they receive a call from Irena to discuss Pawel's wish for religion classes. She informs them that she has enrolled Pawel at religion classes at a local Church. During the phone conversation, Krzysztof and Pawel notice that Krzysztof's computer has turned itself on. A message ' I am ready ' is shown the monitor, which leaves the father and son puzzled.Krzysztof who is a professor of linguistics gives a lecture, asking his students ""to imagine a translator who has acquired complete knowledge
of a word or a language. One with an unlimited memory which can be tapped into at any moment!"". He explains how a mathematical device can have both intelligence and consciousness.Pawel and his father calculate if it is possible for him to skate on the frozen pond. Using the data Pawel gets from the Meteorological Institute, which the computer uses to calculate maximum weight the ice can hold which is three times Pawel's weight. Pawel has already found his Christmas gift his parents had hidden, a pair of skates. He is eager to try them on the frozen pond. Krzysztof gives him permission to skate based on the computer's result. He even goes out to the pond later that night to inspect the strength of the ice.Next morning, while Krzysztof is working the ink bottle on his table breaks all of a sudden. He hears firemen's sirens but then ignores them. He then gets a call from Ewa Jezierska Ewa Kania asking about Pawel, saying her son and Pawel are not back from their English lesson. He goes to the English teacher Maria Gladkowska to find about them, only to find out that she has flu and therefore she had sent them back as soon as they came. Feeling increasingly distressed after finding out to that the ice on the pond has broken, he calls Irena but she also does not know where Pawel is. Krzysztof is still in disbelief when he goes out to the pond where rescue operations are going on. One of Pawel's friend confirms to Krzysztof that Pawel was skating when the ice on the pond broke down. Later at the pond Irena and Krzysztof watch in desperation the rescuer bringing out the corpses out of the frozen water. Krzysztof goes back home filled with heartache and grief over the loss of his son. He finds that the computer has again switched itself on and is showing the message ' I am ready '.With his sorrow, Krzysztof goes to an under-construction church and damages the altar. Due to which the candles fall down and the melting wax drops on the portrait of Black Madonna of Czestochowa, which appears as if she is crying for Pawel. Krzysztof kneels down and crosses himself on the forehead with the ice."
"""I am the Lord thy God; thou shalt have no other God but me."" Ten-year-old Pawel and his father Krzysztof run their lives on their beloved home computer, while Pawel's aunt worries that his spiritual education is being neglected. But Pawel is too busy enjoying life, not least thanks to his father's Christmas present of a pair of ice skates, because the computer has calculated that the frozen lake is safe to skate across...::Michael Brooke <michael@everyman.demon.co.uk>"

"After discussing his plans for retiring by selling on the shares in his security company to his debtors with his partner, André, aging underworld entrepeneur Miles Rennberg (Michael Madison) is paid a surprise visit at his Paris office by aggressive underworld moll Sandra (Asia Argento). Brazenly taunting him with her sexuality, she bluntly dissects their prior relationship - a nightmarish web of masochism, money, manipulation and dependency, pimping her out to dangerous clients in order to gain both a business advantage and perverse personal thrills.She outlines her newest ambition, since their estrangement, of raising the necessary capital to run a nightclub in Beijing. Miles makes no pretence of the fact that he is less interested in the proposal than the woman, and encourages her to visit him at his apartment.Without making any promises, Sandra leaves for her job at an import business, run by a young Chinese married couple: Lester and Sue Wong.Sandra's own import sideline, drug running, is facilitated by her close bond of loyalty with low-ranking employee Lisa. Acting as her driver and lookout, Lisa escorts Sandra to the site of a drug deal that quickly goes sour when her buyer is revealed to be a Narcotics officer. Suspicious after Sandra's cool response to his earler queries about a missing container in a recent shipment, Lester follows Sandra to the deal and accosts Lisa as she waits in the car. He sends Lisa away on his motorcycle and takes her place in the car.After Sandra emerges in a hail of gunfire, Lester drives her away from the scene. Expressing disappointment in her deceit, he takes her back to her apartment where it becomes clear that the two are romantically involved. After their sexual encounter, Lester receives a call from his wife and leaves.Sandra appears to relent and arranges to visit Miles him at his apartment. Goading him with recollections of their misdeeds, she reveals a deep-seated bitterness; she recalls, in particular, an incident where a group of Japanese clients she was entertaining drugged and raped her, and Miles' arousal at hearing the episode recounted in front of his girlfriend. They both drink and end up on the balcony. Sandra undresses and tries to instigate a violent sexual game, apparently of the genre they used to practice, by pinning Miles to the floor of the balcony and choking him with his own belt. Miles warns her off and leads her back inside to show her a pair of handcuffs, which he intends to use on her later in the evening. She expresses reluctance which he nonchalantly waves aside. When she tries to leave, he locks the door and pockets the keys.When he takes a business call, she playfully restrains him with the handcuffs, then brutally shoots him in the head.She quickly retraces her steps through the house, destroying evidence of her presence, and makes a swift exit with Miles' keys. Lester picks her up, gives her a modest sum of cash and the name of a contact in Hong Kong who will arrange her new life, promising to join her soon. Lisa first drives her to a local nightclub to establish an alibi, where the the oppressive atmosphere and the noise provoke an aggressively traumatic and regretful response to her act.Hours behind Lisa, Sandra arrives in Hong Kong. She makes her way to the address of Lester's contact, Mr. Ho, who in turn sends her to a non-descript office somewhere else in the city. She is told that her contact is waiting for her in an adjacent room, but as soon as she enters the door is locked behind her. In the labyrinthine mess of the locked office she eventually discovers the bound and murdered body of Lisa in a chair facing the back wall.A manifestly wealthy, middle-aged Western woman arrives at the office and orders the men to bring Sandra out, chastising them for Lisa's death. Eventually, one of the men in the office is sent in after Sandra. Having switched clothes and positions with the corpse of Lisa, she manages to ambush and kill two of the henchmen and escapes onto the streets. Whilst crossing on a ferry, she cries over her last souvenir of her relationship with Miles, his keys, before dropping them into the water. With little money and no recourse to her credit cards or passport, due to risk of capture and extradition for Miles' murder, Sandra resorts to repeatedly calling Lester.She eventually manages to contact his wife, Sue, who maintains that Lester is unavailable but agrees to meet Sandra in a karaoke club. Sue is evasive and aggressive, revealing that whilst she knew of Sandra's affair with Lester. Sue tells Sandra that she was not her husband's first infidelity and he never really planned to leave his wife to join her. The whole venture was an attempt to raise the investment capital for the Beijing club, an enterprise in which Sue was fully complicit. Whilst she attempts to take everything in, Sue spikes Sandra's drink with a sedative.In a back room, Sandra threatens Sue with a gun and demands more information; Sue pleads her innocence until she manages to talk Sandra into succumbing to the drug's sedative effects. She leaves Sandra unconscious on the floor. The next morning, Sandra wakes in the home of the wealthy Western women who she escaped in the offices earlier. The woman explains that she owes someone a favor and sets Sandra up with papers and well-paid employment elsewhere.Nonetheless, Sandra eschews the easy escape and tracks Lester down in a Hong Kong shopping mall. She follows him up the staircase with an unsheathed knife, but as she prepares to stab him she is interrupted by a group of women coming the other way. Lester enters an expensive restaurant, meets with Miles' business partner, André, and leaves with a sports bag full of cash... ostensibly a payment for Miles' murder, which ensured that his shares did not pass to his unscrupulous creditors. Sandra follows Lester down to the doorway out to the car park, where he hesitates at the threshold as if aware of her presence. At the last moment, however, she finds herself unwilling to either kill or confront him. He walks calmly away with the money, as Sandra turns in the other direction and walks away.

Not yet in her teens, Chuyia is married to a much older and sickly male, who shortly after the marriage, passes away. Chuyia is returned unceremoniously to her parents' house, and from there she is taken to the holy city of Banaras and left in the care of a wide assortment of widows who live at ""the widows' house,"" shunned by the rest of the community. Chuyia believes that her mother will come to take her home. Here she meets several elderly women, including the head of the house, Madhumati; a quiet, confident woman named Shakuntala; and a gorgeous young woman named Kalyani -- all widows. Chuyia does not know that according to Holy Hindu Scriptures she has been destined to live here for the rest of her life, for when a woman's husband dies', she has three options: One, to marry her husband's younger brother, if his family permits; two, to kill herself on his funeral pyre; three, to live a life of celibacy, discipline, and solitude amongst her own kind. A new law in India which permits a widow to re-marry is not popular, and it is these customs and openly welcoming the lower castes that will pit Gandhiji against his very own people, apart from struggling with the British to leave India. Kalyani meets and falls in love with young Narayan, a follower of Mahatma Gandhi, who wants to marry her, despite his mother's protests. The question remains, can Kalyani marry the man she loves? Will he still want to marry her when he knows everything about her? And is Chuyia destined to live the rest of her life as a widow among shunned widows?::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"

"Bangor, Maine is the setting for ""Vacationland"" where our three late high school age youngsters reside. Joe, his sister Theresa, and Joe's high school friend Andrew, the athlete, people the story. Joe and Theresa live with their irresponsible mother, who is often too drunk to materially intervene in their lives. Their part of Bangor encompasses the poor, the down and out, the unemployed and they're yearning to find some way to get out and to get on with their lives. Both Joe and Theresa work for a notions store, She runs the cash register, and Joe stocks the shelves. Andrew is the procurer of the trio. He appears able to to steal anything any of them need. Early in the tale Joe's mom has a fight with her current boyfriend and clocks him with the family phone leaving it blood covered and non functional. Joe mentions to Andrew that he needs to get a phone for his mom. Andrew asks what it should look like. Joe gestures with his hands and they travel to a notions shop. Joe stays outside. Surprisingly soon Andrew exits into the parking lot with a large bag full of merchandise. Joe asks him why he steals so much. Andrew says because he can get away with it. At almost the bottom of the bag Joe says, ""Where's the phone?"" Andrew pulls a phone similar to the ruined one out of the bottom of the bag. It's still wrapped in its plastic packaging mounted on cardboard. He asks Joe whether his mom will like it. As the story proceeds, we find that Andrew has other talents. He makes fake driver's licenses on two occasions for Joe that apparently pass muster, because the alcoholic beverages magically materialize, and are consumed by groups of similarly aged friends. Joe is gay and accepts his fate, but doesn't act on it. Andrew is gay but isn't happy about it and maintains a straight relationship with a classmate. So that they can travel together, Joe goes out with Andrew's girlfriend's girlfriend. As it turns out, neither Andrew nor Joe has a sexual relationship with the girl he dates. We find out that Andrew's girl is a lesbian with a crush on the girl Joe dates. When push comes to shove, Andrew's girl tries to force him to have intercourse with her. When he refuses, she figures out his secret, that he's also gay. She accuses him of being Joe's lover, and under pain of telling the school athletic community his orientation, forces him to have a sexual relationship with Joe which the girls watch. She then maneuvers her girlfriend (Joe's girl) into having a lesbian encounter with her. Joe scopes the want ads and finds a handicapped old man, an artist, who's looking for a model and for help at home. Joe gets the job, moves into the old man's apartment, and forms an attachment for him, buying his prescriptions, and keeping his home neat. The old artist notices Joe's artistic talent, and suggests that he pursue his art. Joe explains to Andrew that when he was 10 years old, he worked for a fat man in a warehouse. At the end of a shift, the fat man sent everybody home but proceeded to take the 10 year old into a gay relationship that traumatized and substantially injured him. He kept the incident to himself, never telling anyone until Andrew. From the time that the girls forced them to interact, Joe and Andrew were free to be their gay identities. Bangor had just one gay club. Joe's second fake ID permitted him to go with Andrew into the gay bar. One night while the boys were clubbing, Joe sees the fat man who injured him so long ago. Joe's sister Theresa has decided to pursue her career in Los Angeles, but she doesn't have enough money for air fare. One night, as she closes the register she pockets the cash... all the cash. She runs out to the airport to buy a ticket, but is $57.00 short. She decides that she can get the balance by engaging a man, and proceeds to catch one. She goes to his room and delays matters until he falls asleep. She takes the money out of his wallet finding enough to make up what she needs. At the airport she buys the ticket and leaves for California. Joe and his artist friend discuss Joe's future. He gets an application to art school for Joe, and Joe draws Andrew naked to submit with his application. Joe's artist friend suggests that when his pain gets so severe that he can't stand it, he knows a combination of his prescriptions that will put him to sleep... permanently. Theresa calls Joe from Los Angeles. She needs more money, but Joe doesn't have anything to send. She hangs up disappointed. Joe goes home to find the artist dead in his shower. He confers with Andrew, tells him he doesn't want to report the death just yet. They go to the gay club and find the fat man who hurt Joe. Joe is disappointed that the fat man doesn't remember him.

"The movie tells the story of Raj Malhotra (Amitabh Bachchan), his wife Pooja (Hema Malini) and their four sons Ajay (Aman Verma), Sanjay (Samir Soni), Rohit (Saahil Chadda), and Karan (Nasir Kazi). Raj and Pooja have provided their children with everything they wanted, often at the cost of Raj's and Pooja's own requirements. The Malhotras also have an adopted son Alok (Salman Khan), who is in love with Arpita (Mahima Chaudhry) (both in special appearances). Alok was an orphan and Raj had provided him with money and education, bringing him up as his own son. Now a successful man, Alok worships Raj because of all his help and thinks him as his own father which he never had.Raj has a flourishing job but, once he retires, he is no longer able to support himself and has to vacate the house he and Pooja have shared for years. They decide to live with their kids to get their love and affection. However, their kids do not want them, as they think looking after their parents will be a hassle. The children decide to split the parents up, each parent going to live with one of the sons for the next 6 months. The children think the parents will refuse the offer and therefore, they will remain in their home. However, the parents reluctantly accept the offer.

Harry is staying with his brother(Morris) and his family. One day after their therapy sessions; when Kate's boarding a bus, Harry follows her.

Harry grabs her hand and she runs along with him. They run across a bridge towards the city. He takes her to a store with TVs airing Wheel of Fortune. Kate crouches on the sidewalk, taking out her journal, she starts watching the show, and writing things down. She tells him that she gets messages at Wheel of Fortune from Astral, her guardian angel. Kate glances up at Harry and barks,"" And dont you dare laugh at me"". He shakes his head, he wont, he wont laugh. Harry and Kate's love affair heats up immediately.

As Harry walks away from them Kate follows him. Harry and Kate stand on the edge of the bridge, in the golden light of sunset, fearful of what will happen with their baby, fearful of how they will survive, afraid of the madness coming again knowing what that is, what that will mean and they flap their arms like the birds, cawing, cawing, cawing reaching out to one another to grasp hands, worried, quite evident in their eyes, but also laughing. Laughing not because they are happy. But laughing because all they have is the moment. In order to avoid any complications to the baby,so that it may not inherit their disorder Kate decides to go off her anti-psychotics for the safety of the baby.

"Though Will Hunting (Matt Damon) has genius-level intelligence (such as a talent for memorizing facts and an intuitive ability to prove sophisticated mathematical theorems), he works as a janitor at MIT and lives alone in a sparsely furnished apartment in an impoverished South Boston neighborhood. An abused foster child, he subconsciously blames himself for his unhappy upbringing and turns this self-loathing into a form of self-sabotage in both his professional and emotional lives. Hence, he is unable to maintain either a steady job or a steady romantic relationship.The first week of classes, Will solves a difficult graduate-level math problem that Professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgård), a Fields Medalist and combinatorialist, left on a chalkboard as a challenge to his students, hoping someone might solve it by the semester's end. Everyone wonders who solved it, and Lambeau puts another problem on the board -- one that took him and his colleagues two years to prove. Will is discovered in the act of solving it, and Lambeau initially believes that Will is vandalizing the board and chases him away as Will insults him. When Will turns out to have solved it correctly, Lambeau tries to track Will down.Meanwhile, Will attacks a youth who had bullied him years before in kindergarten, and he now faces imprisonment after hitting a police officer who was responding to the fight. Realizing Will might have the potential to be a great mathematician, such as the genius Évariste Galois, Lambeau goes to Will's trial and intervenes on his behalf, offering him a choice: either Will can go to jail, or he can be released into Lambeau's personal supervision, where he must study mathematics and see a psychotherapist to help him with his anger and defensive personality. Will chooses the latter even though he seems to believe that he does not need therapy.Five psychologists fail to connect with Will. Out of sheer desperation, Lambeau finally calls on Sean Maguire (Robin Williams), an estranged old friend and MIT classmate of his. Sean differs from his five predecessors in that he is also from South Boston and pushes back at Will and is eventually able to get through to him and his hostile, sarcastic defense mechanisms. At one point, Will analyzes a watercolor painting that Sean had done himself and concludes that it reflects Sean's suppressed feelings and guilt over the premature death of his wife. Sean becomes offended and hostile and grabs Will by the throat, threatening to sink his chances for reform, at which point Will ends the appointment and walks out; Lambeau walks in believing that Will has ruined his chances with yet another therapist. However, Sean sees Will as a challenge and tells Lambeau to bring him back each week.In a later session, Will is particularly struck when Sean tells him how he gave up his ticket to see the Red Sox in the 1975 World Series (missing Carlton ""Pudge"" Fisk's famous home run in the Sox infamous ""Game 6"") in order to meet and spend time with a stranger in a bar, who would later become his wife. Will is encouraged to try to establish a relationship with Skylar (Minnie Driver), a young woman he met at a bar near Harvard.This doctor-patient relationship, however, is far from one-sided. Will challenges Sean in the same way that Sean is encouraging Will to take a good, hard, objective look at himself and his life. Sean's own pathology is that he is unable and unwilling to even consider another romantic relationship in the aftermath of his beloved wife's premature death from cancer several years before, possibly the primary reason why Sean agrees to take Will on as a client.Meanwhile, Lambeau pushes Will so hard to excel that Will eventually refuses to go to the job interviews that Lambeau has arranged for him for positions that might prove challenging, even to his immense talents. Lambeau and Sean also squabble about Will's future. Will's accidental witnessing of this furious quarrel somehow acts as a catalyst for his decision to enter a deeper level of trust and sharing with Sean. He has apparently realized from this event that the situation is a little more complex than Will vs. The World. He now sees that these mentors are every bit as human, fallible, and conflicted as he is.Skylar asks Will to move to California with her, where she will begin medical school at Stanford. Will panics at the thought. Skylar then expresses support about his past, which is received as patronization and triggers a tantrum in which Will storms out of the dorm while in a state of undress. He shrugs off the work he's doing for Lambeau as ""a joke,"" even though Lambeau is incapable of solving some of the theorems and admittedly envies Will. Lambeau begs Will not to throw it all away, but Will walks out on him anyway.Sean points out that Will is so adept at anticipating future failure in his personal and romantic relationships, that he either allows them to fizzle out or deliberately bails in order to avoid the risk of future emotional pain. When Will then provides a whimsical reply to Sean's very serious query of what he wants to do with his life, Sean simply shows him the door. When Will further tells his best friend Chuckie (Ben Affleck) that he wants to be a laborer for the rest of his life, Chuckie becomes brutally honest with Will: He believes it's an ""insult"" for Will to waste his potential as a laborer, and that his recurring wish is to knock on Will's door in the morning when he picks him up for work and find that he just isn't there, that he has left without saying goodbye. Chuckie's honesty hits home with Will more than anyone else's, even Sean, a trained professional.Will goes to another therapy session, where he and Sean share that they were both victims of child abuse. At first, Will is defensive and resentful at Sean's repeated reassurances that ""It's not your fault,"" but he eventually breaks down in tearful acknowledgment. Finally, after much self-reflection, Will decides to cease being a victim of his own inner demons and to take charge of his life. When his buddies present him with a rebuilt Chevy Nova for his 21st birthday, he decides to go to California and reunite with Skylar, setting aside his lucrative corporate and government job offers.Will leaves a brief note for Sean explaining what he's doing, using one of Sean's own quips, ""I had to go see about a girl."" Sean also leaves to travel the world, though not before reconciling with Lambeau. The movie ends as Chuckie poignantly discovers, in fulfillment of his own long-standing wish, that Will has left for a better life. Will is then shown starting his life-affirming drive to California for a new beginning with Skylar and a leap into an unpredictable future."

"Helen Thompson and her young daughter Ellie live in the small town of Hopeville, located on the shores of the Bay of Fundy. It's the day before the annual Swan Festival, the biggest event in town. The event took on a new life twenty years earlier when a non-indigenous Australian black swan was spotted for the first time. Now, legend has it that spotting that black swan has special meaning, for some good, for others bad. It does more so for Helen, whose mother, Mara, died that day when she was washed away by the tides. Helen was told then that her body sailed down to Florida. Helen hates the town, and dreams of moving away, anywhere - but most specifically Florida - someday. Today, the local grocer, Mr. Yung, is missing and presumed murdered, and his store was burglarized. Helen believes her shiftless boyfriend, Carl, had something to do with it. Among others, four people also arrive in town that day. One is wheelchair-bound Albert, who comes into town every couple of years and has a special but dysfunctional relationship with Helen. Two is a mysterious woman wandering the shores, she who comes every year to the festival. And three and four are Clive and Bella from Montreal, who didn't come for the festival but are stuck in town as their car has broken down. Helen sees Clive as her possible ticket out of town.::Huggo"

"Adrift in a lush, nocturnal urban landscape, Nick is a post-modern urban hero asserting his anarchistic agenda on the endless maze of virgin exterior walls that comprise downtown Seattle and Portland. For writer/director Bolton's lonely ""tagger"" protagonist, the vast wall surfaces of deserted alleys and trainyards are at once a daunting symbol of capitalist oppression and a texturally rich, seamless tableau ripe for exploitation to amplify his artistic dialectic of anger and rebellion. His own virtually anonymous existence seemingly only secondary to the painted surfaces and ""rupture the system"" manifesto which more poignantly evidence his presence, Nick's prodigious solo graffiti output is interrupted by friendship with another young tagger. Their communication begins as less verbal than a kind of shared graphic tour de force; their enormous collaborative graffiti murals appear to emerge as the unmistakable offspring of their kindred spirit. But eventually their assumptions about one another are disproved as political, emotional and ethical issues arise which cause their relationship to dissolve into the background of urban detritus, and the artists themselves emerge only further atomized and alienated by the experience. Compelling themes, sensitive performances, and luscious visuals define this film which is a revealing immersion into the experiential reality of those daring to make their art in a socially condemned arena. For a film ostensibly focusing on manipulated surfaces, Bolton's cinematic artistry probes deep into the consciousness of the ""tagger"" and ""graffiti artist"" sub-culture.::Bill Dose"

"It's the end of summer and two friends Taylor (Sam Waterston) and Bert (Robie Porter) decide to drive from Italy to France in an old car, a last hurrah before Taylor goes back home to study law. You find out during the course of film that Taylor comes from money, his father is a doctor. Bert trusts Taylor with managing the finances, because Bert doesn't have a lot of money, but Taylor is more than generous.The movie is paced deliberately with hints that youth is fleeting. The boys have a few clumsy attempts at being carefree and it's readily apparent that Bert is better at it that Taylor. Taylor is quiet and introspective and he is dependent on Bert to help bring him into social situations.One day by chance, Taylor is on his own when he meets Marty (Charlotte Rampling), a woman he later comes to learn is on her own, slumming it away from home in France because she didn't want to be anywhere near her mother and whatever number husband the mother is on. He likes her at once and he has the idea of inviting her along to journey with them back to France. They are to travel together but they are free to do whatever they want with two exceptions: each pays their own way and they are not to be intimate with each other. Taylor can't find it in himself to ask, so Bert does it and Marty accepts.During the course of the arrangement, even after a thinly veiled attempt to tell both of the men that she doesn't mind being with either or both of them, Bert finds a local girl and disappears for a while, leaving Marty and Taylor to their own devices. Marty tries to entice Taylor to sleep with her and even after a passionate embrace but in the end Taylor decides not to jeopardize the arrangement. He tells Marty indirectly that he's fallen for her, and he'll send her letter from the boat on the way home.After a drunken night out with Bert (who most likely suspects what has happened but doesn't say) Taylor changes a little. He tries to be more carefree, even talks of staying in France to go to school instead of going home. Bert has ended his fling and its back to the three of them traveling.The boys are due to leave within a week or so when the three of them are picnicking by the ocean. They witness a boat accident and a man is in obvious distress. Bert and Marty are passive about it, there's a boat in route and they believe the man will be fine. Taylor just can't stand watching this man struggle, so he jumps into the ocean and swims out to help. He doesn't make it to the man, as predicted a boat picks him up. As Taylor swims back, something happens (it's not abundantly clear to me if he has a cramp or is caught by the undertow) but he is shaken up by the experience.Bert and Marty want to go out that night but Taylor declines. Bert says he'll see Taylor later and departs. Taylor has a fitful night of sleep, the ocean haunting him. When he awakes, Bert's bed hasn't been slept in and Taylor correctly assumes that Bert and Marty spent the night together.Taylor leaves Bert his remaining money and a note, takes the car and leaves because the covenant between the three has been broken."
"Two American college friends, traveling in Europe near the Mediterranean, meet and fall for a charming English tourist. However, they agree not to test their friendship and just be friends with her. Soon, reality kicks in.::Cleo <frede005@maroon.tc.umn.edu>"
"Best friends Bert and Taylor, who are twenty-something American college students, are spending their summer driving around Italy and France in an older model Puegeot purchased in Italy, before heading back to the States in September for school. Taylor is the straight-laced, reliable one, who admits that he has problems expressing his feelings, especially to women, while Bert is the smooth talking player. They only have a general idea of where they will go and what they will do, but hoping that they can have some casual female companionship at their various stops. In Florence, they do one better when Taylor meets Marty, a ex-pat Brit living in Paris, he who believes she is a kindred spirit. As such, he suggests to Bert that they ask her along on the remainder of their trip, she to pay her fair share, and if things don't work out that they will part company with no hard feelings. Although both Taylor and Bert think she attractive, they also make a pact not to complicate the situation by getting into a romantic and/or sexual situation with her. Marty agrees with the plan. But as the three spend more and more time together before the summer ends, each will have to decide what their time together really means, and if the no sex pact is broken, what that will do to the situation in the present and to the ""best friend"" friendship between Bert and Taylor in the future.::Huggo"

Ruth says that Hopkins won't be able to recognise her.Polly Patch is the new nanny. Lady Bissop (Pippa Guard) is young and meek and wonders if somebody as ugly as her could do her job well. As her husband approves of ugly people, she hires her on. The lawyer (Olivier Pierre) is afraid that the case is going to be difficult.The judge thinks that all criminals eat lots of peanut butter. The judge enjoys sado-masochist games, and Ruth, posing as Polly Patch discovers so when she finds out a whip and other tools of the trade. Meanwhile, Mary asks her lawyer to defend Bobbo. Bobbo receives Mary's visits at prison, but he doesn't want his own children to see him. A prison warden (Philip Ryan) appears to cut the visit short. The lawyer says that the judge of the case, Bissop, is very upright, but also unpredictable. During lunch, the judge insists that Polly cries out for Lady Bissop, who half-explains nervously that peanut butter is not allowed in the house.Mary has taken charge of the children Bobbo's education, although she is heartbroken. Ruth is trying to improve herself physically - the first thing is going to be to change her teeth, and then, she will make medical history by having a remodel of her jaw, taking out several inches of it. Back at the Bissops, she argues with the judge that peanut butter has nothing to do with criminality, as it happens that while people are in jail waiting for their final sentences, they are given peanut butter, which is cheap but satisfying. Bissop congratulates Polly, as she is the first person to notice the fallacy of his peanut butter idea and said so. Bissop first heard this theory from a defending lawyer. The judge likes the hole in Polly's mouth while she is waiting for her last set of bespoke teeth made by her dentist (Terence Harvey). The judge admits that he is a passionate person with sadistic attitudes, a requirement of his job. In fact, he likes beating up his wife sexually.Virginia Flank with Well Met by Moonlight wins the Romantic Novel Award. Mary Fisher is not even attending the ceremony.

She has allowed her to go out for an appointment.Dr. Rohn (John Rowe) and Dr. Ghengis (Stephen Greif) are carrying the innovative surgery. They asks ""Marlena"" what she wants, and she answers that she wants to look up to men, when can she start to have that surgery? The two doctors are worried about that, because it has never been done.The judge discusses Bobbo's case with Polly Patch. She says that the middle classes commit crimes by design, so that his sentence should be doubled, not halved. The judge takes Polly to bed and beats her the same way he usually beats his wife while he says how many years he is going to give to Bobbo. Polly insists that it is not enough until he offers seven years. Both Bobbo and Mary are devastated; however, Ruth is satisfied, claiming that she wanted a long sentence for him as her sentence has also been very long.Episode 4Mary turns to God out of desperation: she has people she doesn't want - her mother, Bobbo's children - but nothing of what she wants - her Bobbo, her success. The she-devils says that God has no power against her. She calls out Father Ferguson (Tom Baker)'s attention with her sorry glittering eyes. Ruth is Ferguson's new housekeeper, a disaster as a man. She provides him with a wonderful breakfast. ""Molly"", that is, Ruth, refuses to go to mass, because she doesn't believe in god, and tells Ferguson so to his face. Molly agrees with Ferguson that people should not have children if they cannot support them. Molly gives Ferguson plenty of food and alcoholic drinks. Ferguson justifies himself saying that Jesus turned the water into wine. Ferguson says that priests are forced to be celibate, but that it is weird. Ferguson says that most of the sins his flock confess to him have to do with sex in one way or another. Then, he asks Molly to marry him; Molly, becoming serious, confesses that she married once, and that she married forever. Seductively, she offers to do to Ferguson everything else which ""will make him a better priest"". That night, Molly and Ferguson make love.Mary tells Bobbo that they must start to accept god's way during one of her visits. Bobbo is becoming desperate, feeling neglected by god himself. When Mary offers to pray with him, he asks her whether she is going through her menopause.Molly tells the priest that sex is not the problem, it's love. Ferguson says that love is a mirror of divine love, but Molly - just right before going to bed with him - says that love makes people mean, vile, possessive... Ferguson can't wait to have sex with Molly, but she rejects him to preach about the immorality of romantic fiction, which is affecting women to be unrealistic about love. Ferguson recognises immediately the photograph at the back cover of the novel, saying she is part of his parishioners.Mary receives a letter from Bobbo, saying that he doesn't want her to visit him anymore, as it is too unsettling for both of them, according to him. In his letter, he claims it was not love but sex which kept them together. That is the last straw for Mary, who cries thinking she is alone. She dreams about Ferguson, who suddenly appears in the sitting room of her tower mansion. They go together for a stroll in the woods nearby, and Ferguson says that love is an illusion. She says that she has met love before. Ferguson tells her to stop writing about love because it is deluding millions of women. When Mary tries to say that even the Bible speaks about love, the priest says that the Bible is worse than a lie. Ferguson gets drink and inspires Mary a new novel, The Pearly Gates of Love.Mary publishes the novel, but it is a financial disaster. However, she is not going to read it - she uses the photography of Mary Fisher at the back to take it to the doctors and say that she wants to be like her, including being 6 inches shorter. It will take years and millions of dollars. On her flight to California, Ruth reads Mary Fisher's last novel. Meanwhile, the wind starts to create decay at the previously perfect tower by the cliff. Mary has written the novel she feels describes her feelings - a nun which struggles to love Jesus. Ferguson says that humans are both flesh and mind. He encourages Mary to write about sex. He touches her with his foot in a totally inappropriate way. Garcia sees Ferguson and Mary having sex on the floor of the sitting-room.At the Hermione Clinic in California arrives Marlena. Mary dismisses Garcia, as she cannot afford any more wages. Mary's mother tells her to get rid of that ""black crow"", as priests bring black luck.The doctors unveil Marlena's bruised face. One of the nurses, (Teresa Garraway), the wife of Dr Black (Terrance Conder) cannot even refrain to look somewhere else.The priest finally realises that he has sinned; he blames her, saying that she seduced him and that she will go to hell. She accepts all the charges and says that she is already in hell. The priest realises that she is still in love with Bobbo, but she refuses that - she doesn't love anybody, and she wishes she would be dead. He seems to mock her, saying that even when she thinks of suicide she is a romantic.Mary keeps on writing in spite of everything. She looks plainer and frightened of her own ghosts. A storm breaks and she has illusions of damnation, ghosts everywhere. Ruth claims that even in her desperate state Mary lies in her writings. The wind scatters all the pages and breaks a mirror. Mary shouts ""Ruth!"", as she realises that it is her who's been causing all that phenomena. The gale pushes her out of the balcony into the cliff and her death.""My friend is dead. Long live my friend"", says Ruth in a voiceover. Ruth goes to the funeral; she looks like Mary Fisher at her best moment. Mary's mother even confuses Ruth with her late daughter, calling her ""poor little slut"". Ruth's chauffeur drives her away. Bobbo asks her if he knows her. Ruth says that she is his wife. Bobbo replies that his wife died a long time ago and says that she is Mary Fisher. The prison warden takes him away.Ruth (now played by Patricia Hodge) says she will never be satisfied until she gets everything she had: her tower, beauty, lovers... She doesn't care if there is risk to her life, and that her life will be pain forever after - she wants to be shorter because that is what beauty dictates.It is a miracle Ruth is alive. After therapy, she has to learn to walk again.One of the doctors take her to a party. She still has some difficulties walking. Mrs Nancy Black says that Ruth is an insult to womanhood as she looks like a doll. She calls her husband Frankenstein, but he is infatuated with her, pushing one of the doctors away. They fight for her. Ruth enjoys it. Nancy Black says she is sick and tired of doctors' hypocrisy, and that she will marry somebody honest, like a soldier or a bomber. When Ruth leaves for the tower, she gives her old doctor a ""prophetic book"" as a present - it's Huysmans 'Against Nature', as she claims that from that moment, even nature will do what she pleases. The She-Devil now lives in the High Tower overlooking the sea.Ruth writes to Bobbo, saying that it was not a matter of men against women, - it's a matter of power, and now, he has none. She has many lovers, including Garcia. Bobbo has to be present and watch her making love to different male lovers.----written by KrystelClaire"
"Ruth has everything. A large, warty body, a standard house in the suburbs, two whiney children, a dog, a cat and a guinea pig. She also has Bobo, her unfaithful accountant husband who resents her very existence. Bobo wants, and is wanted by, Mary Fisher. Mary Fisher lives in a lighthouse by the sea and writes about love. When Bobo leaves Ruth for the novelist, she decides that Mary Fisher doesn't know the first thing about love. Ruth intends to teach her.::Renee Ann Byrd <byrdie@wyrdbyrd.org>"
"The existential protagonist is a hungry, homeless, socially isolated, and socially alienated young man living on the streets of an anonymous Russian big city in the 19th Century. He's looking for answers about himself and the things that he sees around him, but he's coming up short. Very innovative cinematography that alternates between B&W and full color through the course of the film in a way that accents the dramatic action. Sometimes, a B&W scene will even become full color in just one spot on the screen, a unique alternative to a close up shot.::Joe Kulik-jkulik919@gmail.com"

"WELCOME TO PARADISE is the inspirational family story of a preacher who is sent from a big city church to Paradise, a small, rural community that is in desperate need of direction. The fact that the preacher is named Debbie only complicates things. She finds a town that is stuck in complacency as well as a town that turns its back on its neediest neighbors. Debbie begins building a new vision for her congregation and the veil of indifference starts to lift. When the Paradise Church is accidentally burned down, and it's charter is in danger of being revoked, the members rally around Debbie and in doing so, realize that a ""church"" is defined by it's community, not by the four walls that house a Sunday Service. Debbie's kindness and insight bring a blast of fresh air to this out of the way country town. It also brings her a second chance at love.::Patrick Stack"

"We begin with an aerial view of the hotels in Las Vegas, before settling on one called the Shangri-La. Inside one gaming area, the patrons all seem to be winning. Joe, a floor boss, picks up a phone and asks where Bernie is - they need him right away. Moments later, from an elevator emerges Bernie Lootz (William H. Macy), dressed in a seedy-looking ill-fitting suit. As he limps through the casino and passes people, their luck immediately goes sour. Roulette wheels, blackjack cards, crap tables and slot machines all stop paying out. Bernie then wanders over to Doris, the barmaid, who pours him a coffee. He asks for cream, but as she starts to pour it the creamer runs dry.A pretty blonde waitress, Natalie Belisario (Maria Bello) brings a drink order to the bar. Bernie tries to chat with her, but she is clearly distracted. She asks Doris if Shelly left word for her; he was supposed to put her at the tables rather than the nickel slots she's been stuck at. As Natalie leaves, Bernie promises her he'll talk to Shelly but she doesn't seem to notice.Joe tells Bernie he's needed on table 11. Bernie tells Joe to have Natalie bring him a drink - that he talked to Shelly and he wanted her on the tables tonight. Natalie brings him the drink, thanking him for talking to Shelly. Bernie then takes the drink to a player at the crap table who's having a hot streak - which ends immediately. Bernie then plays some blackjack, losing his money and wrecking the luck of all the other players.Next, we see casino boss Shelly Kaplow (Alec Baldwin) in his office. He has a headache and is trying to get a manicure, when a small entourage of men in gray suits barge in . Leading the pack is his casino partner, Nicky Bonnatto (Arthur J. Nascarella). Nicky introduces Shelly to his new VP Larry Sokolov (Ron Livingston) and his numbers guy, Marty Goldfarb. After drinks, smokes and jokes, Nicky tells Shelly that Larry has some ideas to revitalize the Shangri-La. Shelly asks why - they raked in $35 million last year. Larry explains that he respects the job Shelly has done the last 16 years, but that things have changed on the strip. Shelly responds in disgust about the ""Disneyland"" the strip has become. What was once a high class hooker, has now become a cheap, fat whore. Larry points out that other casinos are raking in dough and the Shangri-La just can't compete anymore. Shelly says they're not trying to compete; this is where old-time real money comes to play. Larry counters they only offer nostalgia - fine for museums but not casinos.Later, Shelly meets Bernie on the floor and stops him for a chat. He asks how his knee is and tells him about an orthopedist who can make a kneecap out of titanium. But Bernie reminds him he won't be here past Sunday. Shelly asks him where he's going to go that better than this. But Bernie insists that in seven days he's gone.Bernie goes to his motel room at the Bettor Life motel, a dismal dive. He sits in bed watching TV. He can't even try to sleep because his neighbor is having loud, headboard-banging sex on the opposite side of the wall.Next day, a high roller is on a hot streak. When Natalie brings him his drink, he deliberately takes his time stuffing the money into her cleavage, causing her to topple over into Bernie. She apologizes, but Bernie tells her she might want to stick around. He hands the guy some new dice, and his lucky streak evaporates. The roller sees Natalie smiling at his misfortune, and starts swearing at her, until he is hauled off by security. Natalie smiles at Bernie gratefully.Shelly takes his partner and the new guys out to watch Buddy Stafford (Paul Sorvino), the casino's older, worn-down lounge singer. Larry is clearly not impressed. Shelly goes to see the singer in his dressing room. Buddy is embarrassed about his performance. Shelly tries to pump up his ego, but Buddy is more concerned whether Shelly brought his fix. Shelly did and Buddy quickly shoots up. He tells Shelly about a nature show he saw - how a lion who was once the leader of a pride had gone past his prime and was expelled and left to forage on his own until he died. It would be so much easier, he moans, if he could just walk away with his dignity intact. Shelly disagrees, saying that would be like admitting he was dead already.Bernie walks out to his car and is surprised to find Natalie waiting for him. ""Buy you a drink?"" she invites. Larry, meanwhile, introduces Shelly to Johnny Capella (Joey Fatone), a new hot singer he thinks should be headlining at the Shangri-La. Shelly tells Larry he already has Buddy signed up for five more years. Johnny is miffed and walks out.Natalie and Bernie are in a diner, where she is reviewing his astrological chart, telling him he is a slow starter when it comes to romance. He tells her it all doesn't matter; he knows what the outcome will be - all bad. He asks if she knows what he does. ""You're a cooler"", she replies. ""You turn winners into losers"". He tells her he does it by just being himself. Everyone who's ever been next to him has had their luck turn sour; it's always been that way. That sounds like a self-fulfilling prophecy, she retorts. He blurts out that he is leaving in five days anyway, so she suggests they don't waste any time and just go to his place. He nervously tells her he's not sure he can afford her. She is insulted, and he realizes he's made a mistake. I've done it again, he tells her. I've cooled the damn table. But she assures him he hasn't cooled anything yet.They go to his motel room, where she notices his plants are all dead, and he has a cat food dish but no cat. She sits down on the bed, while he dusts off an old record. But as it starts to play the needle scratches across it. He resets it and nervously sits next to her. She tells him to relax - at least one of them has done this before. As the record starts to play, ""Luck Be a Lady Tonight"", she starts to undress. He notices she has a tattoo of two dice, each reading a two, on her behind. She walks to him coyly and starts to seduce him. But he is nervous, and ends up just rolling on top of her and finishing very quickly. She tells him gently, ""It's okay. I've had worse"", then gives him other kind reassurances. The next morning Bernie wakes up to find he's alone. Sadly, he picks up her pillow and hugs it. Suddenly she walks out of the bathroom, brushing her teeth, and asks if he wants to go to breakfast. He nods yes with a huge smile.At breakfast, he tells her about his past. He was an out-of-control gambler who built up a huge debt until Shelly broke his legs with a baseball bat. Natalie is horrified, but Bernie says he's actually grateful. His shattered bones are a reminder to keep him from giving into the temptation to gamble. He worked out a repayment plan with Shelly - six years off the books cooling tables, and it's up in five days. The conversation is interrupted as a pregnant girl nearby has labor pains. Bernie sees them and recognizes the husband as his son, Mikey (Shawn Hatosy). Bernie and Natalie escort the pregnant couple, Mikey and Charlene (Estella Warren), to their car. She has settled down and is no longer in labor. When Bernie asks about Mikey's mother, he angrily responds she's getting by as long as she's high. Bernie nervously invites him to come to his motel to ""catch up"". Mikey says he might do that for the kid's sake.Bernie sits down at a blackjack table with one other player, Mel, who is obviously winning. He bets one hand and the dealer goes bust with it. Afterward, incredibly, the dealer busts on hand after hand, letting Mel rake in the dough. Bernie is perplexed and leaves the table. Shelly wonders if the dealer is cheating, but can't believe it. They run across Larry - who knows Bernie is a cooler. He chides Shelly for sticking to the old ways. He says there are more effective ways nowadays. He shows Shelly a CD with soft music laced with a subliminal message of ""Lose. Lose. Lose."" Shelly only rolls his eyes.The other partners arrive, and Shelly takes them to Buddy's room only to find Buddy on the floor dead of an overdose. Shelly suggests that the Paradise room stay closed tonight in Buddy's honor, but Larry quickly has Johnny Capella take over and do the show. The partners are impressed, but not Shelly.Bernie and Natalie try the ring toss as a carnival, but she misses all her tosses. They sit down and Natalie looks sadly at a little boy standing next to his dad. She asks Bernie if he noticed the tattoo on her butt: two dice each with a 2 - a Little Joe. She admits she had a son named Joe, but only for a year. She gave him up for adoption ten years ago because she was 17 and wanted her life back. Her family abandoned her after that, and she ran off to become a showgirl. Deep down, she knows she did the right thing, but now feels she was selfish. Bernie stands up as if to leave, and tells her softly, ""I think...I could kick your ass at the dime toss"". She laughs and they hug tenderly.Afterward, they make love in his motel room. Bernie is now very confident and gives Natalie obvious pleasure. Then with a smile he asks if she'll do something for him. Moments later, it sounds like they are having loud, headboard-banging sex, but the camera pans up to reveal that the two of them are just leaning against the headboard, rocking it and screaming out loudly. Finally, Bernie screams out and the two collapse, quietly laughing as the neighbor yells for them to shut up. ""Did we wake you?"" Bernie calls out.Later on, Natalie returns to Bernie's apartment to find Charlene and Mikey waiting there. Mikey asks if Bernie is renting her, because he can't figure out how else his loser father could get so lucky. Before she can say something back, Bernie returns from parking his car. He's surprised but happy to see Mikey. Mikey then tells him they're strapped for money and Bernie gives them $3,000 in cash, all the money he has to spare.Meanwhile, Larry presents a model of the new Golden Shangri-La to the partners: 3 floors of gaming, entertainment, boutiques, restaurants - even a roller coaster. Shelly responds by telling them the plot of the movie LOST HORIZON, how Shangri-La was totally untouched by the outside world - a paradise. Thats what the hotel Shangri-La was supposed to be, and you don't mess with that. Shelly insists that someday people will want the old Vegas back and he'll be there to give it to them.Nicky then goes to play some craps but is annoyed by a rude player. After Nick craps out and the guy laughs, Nicky head-butts him and beats him bloody until security, called by Bernie, drags the guy away. Bernie tells Natalie how anxious he is to get out of Vegas and begs her to come with him. She answers that she's done an astrological compatibility chart on them and they're good together - but only if they stay in Vegas.Bernie returns to his job. As he stands by a table, he is appalled to see his son there, playing craps. Natalie finds him and so does Larry, as Mikey rolls two nines and wins big. Shelly arrives in time to see Mike subtly switching back the real dice for his obviously loaded dice. He then throws a losing roll and decides to graciously leave with his winnings. Shelly tells him he doesn't want to lay out that kind of cash on the floor and invites them to come to his office to collect. Mikey agrees, but when Shelly tells him not to bother bringing his chips he knows he's in trouble. Larry suggests they turn them in to the authorities, but Shelly tells Larry to watch him protect his investment the ""old school"" way. Bernie is torn up, but goes to save his son.Shelly has the couple down in a basement area, about to work Mikey over when Bernie arrives and begs him to stop. Shelly accuses Bernie of being in on the con, but believes him when he denies it. Instead, he tells Bernie they were up 150 grand when they left the table, so he wants $75,000 each for their lives. When they start to punch Mikey, Bernie agrees to cover the 150 G's. Charlene then starts to have contractions and pleads to go to the hospital. Shelly responds by kicking her in the stomach, then pulling up her shirt to reveal that the ""baby"" was just a large cushion. Shelly mocks the shocked Bernie by cradling the cushion. He gives Bernie a chance to change his mind but the cooler still offers to cover the debt. Shelly then orders Mikey to be put up on the table. Bernie pleads that they had a deal, but Shelly tells him 150 grand buys only their lives. With that he takes a sledge hammer and breaks both of Mikey's legs.Back at his motel, Bernie blames himself for what happened to Mikey. Natalie gently tells him to stop beating up on himself and begins to dance with him instead. Later on, they are in bed together. She sits up and confesses that she knows she loves him. ""You blindsided me, Bernie Lootz,"" she declares. ""I never saw it coming"". She then tells him there are things about her that he should know, but he doesn't care; it won't change how he feels about her. He's afraid to voice just how he feels about her because of all his rotten luck. But she tells him his rotten luck is all over now, so he admits that he loves her too.As a new day dawns, Bernie awakes to find his cat Trixie has come back, and Natalie has left him a note, ""Have a Spectacular Day"". He goes off to work with a new confidence. When the waitress pours his coffee, the creamer finally pours out cream for him. As he makes his rounds, people around him start to get very lucky. Even as Shelly takes him aside to find out what's going on, a brand new slot machine rigged for virtually no payouts hits a big jackpot. Bernie tells Shelly theres nothing wrong with him - he's just in love!Shelly has Natalie brought to him. He reminds her he only hired her to be a lover to Bernie, not to actually fall in love with him. Now his falling in love has turned Lootz's bad luck to good and cost the casino at least a million. He demands that she leave him, not even telling him to his face but just leaving a note. She refuses at first until Shelly threatens her life.Bernie returns home to find a note from Natalie that she has left him. Afterward he returns to the casino to find the creamer has run dry again and he is once more bringing bad luck to everyone he touches. He meets Shelly in the lounge and asks if he muscled Natalie into leaving, but Shelly denies everything and acts offended. Bernie comments that the new lounge singer is all flash and no soul and that he misses Buddy. Shelly tells him Buddy was tired and that he gave him an easy way out. He admits that he knew Buddy would never accept the casino buyout. He'd have fought to the end and eventually would have been hurt. So he gave him the overdose instead and let him die peacefully. Bernie is appalled.That night in his motel room, a lonely Bernie hears a knock on the door. Natalie is back, suitcase in hand. He takes her back before she can even say a word. Later, in bed, she suggests they run away together, but he says he can't. He owes Shelly a debt, and if he ran, Shelly would come after him and hurt her as well.At the casino, Bernie is bringing people luck again, so Shelly has Natalie grabbed from the motel. He tells her he could make her disappear and no one would miss her. ""Bernie would!"" she counters. She tells Shelly it must kill him to know that Bernie loves her. Bernie was your friend, she shouts at him, and you crippled him. Still he stood by you but no more! She and Bernie are leaving tonight and he can't stop them. Shelly slams her face into a mirror which shatters and leaves her face bloody. He then departs quietly.Bernie returns home to find Natalie hiding in the dark. He finds the broken mirror and turns on the light, seeing her with cuts on her face. She confesses that Shelly paid her to get close to him. She thought it was easy money. But as she got to know him, she saw that he wasn't a phony or a hustler but a decent guy. And she loved the way he treated her like a lady. Now Shelly wants her gone because she brought him luck. She just wanted to tell him the truth before leaving him, because she knows he wouldn't want her now. But instead, Bernie rushes her to the hospital, where they stitch up her cuts. He tells her afterward that everything will be all right. And if she ever looks in the mirror and doesn't like what she sees, then don't believe it. Look into my eyes instead, he tells her tenderly, they're the only mirror you're ever going to need.They go back to the Shangri-La. She tells him she lied about his astrological chart that first night - that it was actually the worst she had ever seen. But he assures her that was before he opened his heart to her now he has Lady Luck on his side. She gives him the $3,000 that Shelly had paid her and suggests he give it to Shelly as a down payment.He goes inside to where Shelly is meeting with his partners, throws Natalie's bloody handkerchief on the table and punches Shelly in the stomach swearing to kill him if he touches Natalie again. Shelly and his men drag Bernie up to the roof. Shelly says he hurt Natalie because he never gives up on a good thing, and Bernie is a very good thing - the best cooler ever. Bernie says he's not that man anymore. He promises to leave, get a job and send Shelly half his paycheck, but.Shelly says if he tries to leave the casino without paying his debt, he'll toss both he and Natalie off the roof. Bernie says he won't do that, because with him dead, he'd no longer the biggest loser in the world - Shelly would. What do you have except this place, Bernie challenges, your legacy is an illusion - you've got nothing. Shelly isn't impressed by the speech and walks away.Bernie turns his $3,000 into chips and starts throwing the dice at the crap table and winning. After he has run up some serious money and gotten Shelly's attention (but no interference from him) Larry arrives demanding Shelly shut him down right now and proclaiming that Bernie isn't leaving with one dime. Shelly hauls Larry into the men's room and tells him Bernie is okay and nobody's touching a hair on his head. He pins Shelly down and declares, wait, on a subsonic level, I hear a mantra ""Pain! Pain! Pain!"" Then he breaks Larry's wrist.At the table, Bernie is up over 100 grand until he craps out. He bets again but craps out a second time. He then takes the rest of his chips - $80,000 in all and places one last bet, throwing the dice nervously. He is next seen walking out of the casino empty-handed. Natalie is just grateful that he is alive as he drives them away. Meanwhile, Shelly is in his office with a headache, refusing to answer his ringing phone. He finally smashes the model of the new Golden Shangri-La to bits.Miles away in the car, Natalie asks Bernie to tell her what happened. He stops the car on the side of a desert road and opens the door as if he has to throw up. Meanwhile, Shelly gets into his car in the parking lot only to find Nicky waiting in his back seat. Bernie, meanwhile, proceeds to pull wads of money out of his pockets. He tells Natalie he won big at the casino. ""Bahamas, here we come"", he declares. Then a cop appears at their window, ordering them to step out. Bernie tells the cop he's sorry if he was driving carelessly, but that they just won a load of money. The cop pulls out a gun and tells them they didn't win anything - and orders them to get on their knees.Nicky tells Shelly he's just protecting his investment the old school way. He points his gun at Shelly's temple and shoots him dead. Meanwhile, on their knees in the desert, Natalie whispers to Bernie that they should have known it was all too good to be true. They turn to give each other one last loving gaze as the cop cocks his gun. But instead of hearing a gunshot, they hear a loud thud. They turn to see that a car has run down and killed the cop. Bernie realizes it was just a random drunk driver - a freaky, lucky coincidence. Bernie and Natalie get back into the car and drive away with their money.We see Larry being introduced to the investors as the new Director of Casino Operations at the new Golden Shangri-La. ""The future looks very bright, gentlemen. Very, very bright,"" he assures them. And with those words of endorsement ringing in our ears, we watch Bernie and Natalie drive off toward a new life together."

"The unluckiest man in Vegas - a guy whose bad luck is contagious - is used by the last of the old time mob run casinos to kill high rollers' action. That is, until he falls in love with a cocktail waitress and gets ""lady luck,"" which throws the situation into reverse. Things turn nasty when the casino director tries to break up the romance.::Anonymous"
"The Shangri-La Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas is managed by Shelly Kaplow, who hates what has been the Disneyfication of the Strip as he is ""old school Vegas"", still doing things the old fashioned way catering to who he considers old fashioned clients, i.e. those who remember and admire people like the Rat Pack. One of those old fashioned measures is to use threats, intimidation and violence, implied or real, to deal with players trying to scam the casino. Another old fashioned measure he has implemented is to employ Bernie Lootz as a ""cooler"": turn the winning fortunes of casino players into losing ones. Bernie is a sad sack, a schmuck and a loser, so he does his job, and does it well, by hanging around those players with hot streaks and just being himself. Bernie could not turn down Shelly's offer of employment as he owes Shelly money, Shelly who broke Bernie's knee for that debt, with the result being that Bernie still walks with a limp. Bernie will be able to pay Shelly off with one more week of employment, after which he is determined to leave Vegas forever, putting this miserable phase of his life behind him. Things change for Bernie on two fronts. First, his estranged grown son Mikey and his very pregnant girlfriend Charlene enter his life, they who need money for the baby and who will get it any way they can. And second, Bernie is attracted to Natalie Belisario, a new waitress at the casino, who seems to be equally as attracted to him. Natalie, who believes in the alignment of the stars affecting one's life, only sees them in a relationship if they stay in Vegas. As such, Bernie has to decide if Natalie in his life is worth remaining in Vegas. Things may also be changing for Shelly as Nicky Bonnatto, one of his mob investors, has brought in a young Harvard grad named Larry Sokolov as an advisor to modernize the operation. Shelly may try to protect his way of life, against Nicky, Larry and others, in the only ways he knows how.::Huggo"

"The Miami Sharks, a once-great American football team, are now in turmoil and struggling to make the AFFA (Associated Football Franchises of America) playoffs in the year of 2001. They are coached by Tony D'Amato who is a thirty year veteran.During the first game shown, which is the thirteenth game of the season, both the starting quarterback Jack ""Cap"" Rooney (Dennis Quaid) and the second-string quarterback Tyler Cherubini are injured and forced to leave the game due to poor offensive line play in blitz pickup. (This leads to a recurring theme that ""on any given Sunday, anything can happen."") The ailing and increasingly desperate Sharks are forced to call upon third-string quarterback and former seventh-round draft pick Willie Beamen (Jamie Foxx). Beamen is visibly nervous and makes a number of errors illustrating his lack of knowledge regarding the team's playbook. During one play he lines up under the guard instead of the center, and he later in the game he audibles to a play which does not exist. He throws up in the huddle, which begins a ritual that he follows every game, reminiscent of Hall of Fame Buffalo Bills quarterback Jim Kelly. While the Sharks lose this game by a small margin, Beamen plays well and gains confidence.During the next game Beamen begins to get comfortable with the game and quickly learns the offense. However, he dislikes the Sharks' conservative offense and much to the dismay of both Coach Tony D'Amato (Al Pacino). Beaman begins to change the plays in the huddle, not realizing the disrespect this shows to his coaches. Beamen displays his raw athletic talent and starts to run and pass extremely successfully and leads the sharks to the playoffs after winning the last three of the last four games of the season, bringing the Sharks to 9-7 on the year. Beaman's new found success results in a growing narcissism and arrogance. He becomes ""Steamin'"" Willie Beamen, the new poster boy for the AFFA, and receives numerous lucrative advertisement deals, including a music video.His new-found success, and inability to handle it, leads to tension within the Sharks locker room and the front office. D'Amato confronts Beamen to ask why he has been changing the plays, to which Beaman responds selfishly. After displaying to D'Amato that Beamen is not capable of leading the team, D'Amato tells Beamen that it is likely that 'Cap' Rooney will probably be fit and available for the playoffs, demoting Beamen back to the bench. Beaman fails to understand the team concept as he is filled with self-pity about how his career has been until he got a chance to play.A rift forms between Beaman and D'Amato after D'Amato tells him just how far he still has to go to fulfill his potential and lead the team. After learning of his demotion he alienates the rest of the team, to the point that he gets his car sawed in half at a party, and the Sharks are blown out at home in a game that could have given the Sharks home field advantage in the playoffs. Beaman contemplates and amends his selfish behavior.In the final game, Miami manages a come-from-behind win in the final seconds against the Dallas Knights, winning the first round of the playoffs. The final game sees Cap return to start as quarterback and he plays strongly until being injured by a hit. His replacement, Beaman, apologizes for his actions to the team in the huddle on the game-winning drive. Off-screen, Miami beats Minnesota for their conference championship and then loses to San Francisco in the Pantheon Cup Championship 32-13 (reminiscent of Super Bowl XIX).At D'Amato's final press conference as head coach, all feuds have been resolved or at least put on hold and he leaves on a positive note, being thanked by owner Christina Pagniacci (Cameron Diaz) and the media for his contributions to the team. D'Amato is then expected to announce his retirement, but then drops a bombshell and announces that he has been hired as Head Coach and General Manager of the expansion team Albuquerque Aztecs. He adds that he signed Willie Beamen as his starting quarterback and franchise player, after the Sharks refused to extend Beamen's expiring contract mid-season. As the scene ends, Christina and the other executives are angrily asking Crozier how he could have let Beamen finish the season without re-signing him to a longer contract for the Sharks.Despite the initial hysteria among the media and owners, the general consensus is that this is the best solution because D'Amato and Crozier (backed by Christina) cannot co-exist. This would also possibly allow Cap Rooney to remain Miami's starting quarterback for the next season and retire on his own terms, instead of risking being demoted to backup.

A behind-the-scenes look at the life-and-death struggles of modern-day gladiators and those who lead them.::Anonymous
"When a devastating hit knocks a professional football legend and quarterback Cap Rooney out of the game, a young, unknown third-stringer is called in to replace him. Having ridden the bench for years because of a string of bad luck stories and perhaps insufficient character, Willie Beaman seizes what may be his last chance, and lights up the field with a raw display of athletic prowess. His stunning performance over several games is so outstanding and fresh it seems to augur a new era in the history of this Miami franchise, and forces aging coach Tony D'Amato to reevaluate his time-tested values and strategies and begin to confront the fact that the game, as well as post-modern life may be passing him by. Adding to the pressure on D'Amato to win at any cost is the aggressive young President/Co-owner of the team, Christina Pagniacci, now coming into her own after her father's death. Christina's driving desire to prove herself in a male dominated world is intensified by her focus on the marketing and business of football, in which all coaches and players are merely properties.::Anonymous"
"Four years ago, the Miami Sharks won the Pantheon Cup. This year, they are at best a middling team on a three game losing streak. With a 7-5 record with four games left in the season, they are still in the hunt for a playoff spot. That playoff spot becomes more difficult to achieve as in the fourth to last game, it against the Minnesota Americans, their top two quarterbacks are injured - including veteran first stringer Cap Rooney - leaving the QB duties for the rest of the season to third string Willie Beamen, who may be more emotionally and experientially ill-prepared for the role than he is technically. That inexperience and immaturity manifest themselves in acts of showboating on the field, leading to issues between him, the other players, and thirty year head coach, Tony D'Amato, who wants to see some discipline on the field. Tony already faces problems off the field with new owner/general manager, Christina Pagniacci, the only female owner in the league. She inherited the team from her father Art Pagniacci after his passing. While Tony and Art had a gentlemen's agreement type of relationship, Christina, who grew up calling Tony ""Uncle Tony"", isn't afraid to flex her muscles to make the team a success, she seeing the team's coaching future in the younger offensive coordinator, Nick Crozier. Her ultimate goal is to move the team to the larger market of Los Angeles, timely in her issues with how little she has seen Miami Mayor Tyrone Smalls put into maintaining the aging stadium or that there has been no talk about replacing it. The team, however, has to be a success for her to have the money to do so. Back on the field, Cap, who believes he will be healthy enough to play in the playoffs, comes to the realization that if Willie got them to the playoffs, he may be the favored starter in the playoffs, especially seeing to Cap's time off and age. Cap's health issue is minor compared to that of linebacker Luther Lavay, which highlights the differences between the team's doctors, Harvey Mandrake and Ollie Powers who sit on opposite sides of the player welfare versus overall team success at all cost debate.::Huggo"

"Cliff Barton, an American business executive working in England, wants to marry European refugee Miriam Linka, but he is warned by his boss that such things just aren't done. Cliff digs in his heels and eventually finds support from his less hidebound fellow executives."
"Middle-aged Cliff Barton is the Vice-Chair of Amalgamated World Metals, a New York based company specializing in natural resources. George Salt, Amalgamated's aging, long serving, cutthroat Chair, sees Cliff as the heir apparent to the company, Cliff who George has molded in his own corporate image. George believes that the wives of business executives are just as important as the executives themselves in the wives needing to support openly their husbands in the operation of their respective company. George also believes that Cliff's fiancée, George's own young niece Joan Salt, will be such a wife, she demonstrating that loyalty, despite her obvious disappointment, in supporting Cliff in the need to take an extended business trip to London, he being gone on what was supposed to be the day of their wedding. That trip is to ink a lucrative deal that would set him and Joan up in their new life together. Mrs. Salt asks Cliff to do her a favor while in England by looking into a London based charity she supports, one that assists Central European refugee artists in eking out a new artistic life in England. The charity is operated by widowed Miriam Linka, one such Austrian refugee herself and whose husband was killed in the war. Despite her initial open disdain for Americans like Cliff - wealthy, privileged and cocksure - and their antagonistic beginning, the two end up falling in love, she who he wants to marry and she who makes him question his core beliefs in the way he has behaved at Amalgamated with who was to be his father-in-law. The question then becomes if there is any way to reconcile Cliff's want to marry Miriam against his life at Amalgamated with George at the helm, with George's feelings about Joan and Miriam - without even having met the latter - at the core, especially with the innuendo swirling around Miriam. Cliff's livelihood in its entirety, at least in the corporate world, hangs in the balance.::Huggo"

"A television adaptation of Michael Frayn's celebrated and award-winning stage play about the meeting between physicists Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg in 1941 Copenhagen. At this time the young Heisenberg was leading a faltering German research program into nuclear energy, while the middle-aged and apparently isolated Bohr was in contact with allied agents, and still held a position of great influence in the nuclear physics research community. After the meeting the two men put different interpretations or impressions of why Heisenberg requested the meeting, and what he hoped to gain from it, a theme which mirrors the ambiguity of the ""Copenhagen"" interpretation widely used in quantum physics. Did Heisenberg go to the avuncular Bohr to seek his blessing for his role in nuclear research? Why did Heisenberg concentrate on the development of a nuclear reactor, and not perform the calculations which would show that a bomb could be made to work via a fast-neutron reaction in Uranium 235? These and other questions feature in the plot, although unsurprisingly there are few certain answers.::Simon Shearn"

"Werckmeister Harmonies is an allegory of the post WWII Eastern European political systems told as a b&w filmmatic poem with 37 long single camera shots.The film was made post the end of the cold war in Hungary 2000 it is based on a 1989 book ""The Melancholy of Resistance"" written during the time of the iron curtain by László Krasznahorkai. It examines the brutalisation of a society its political systems and dogmas through the metaphor of a decaying circus whale and its star performer. It is set in a desolate, isolated small town in Hungary during Soviet times.The film starts with János Valuska, a simple citizen, conducting a poem and dance with drunken bar patrons. The dance is of the total eclipse of the sun, which disturbs than silences the animals, but it finishes with the grand return of the warm sunlight.A reoccurring theme is the transitions from darkness to light. In the opening scene the light represent the warm sun of self determination which transitions to the people thrown out through a door in to the dark of night. The circus arrives like a Trojan Horse in the darkness of night. There is a wonderful poetic scene were the lead character walks in and out of the shadows .The film is in b&wHis uncle György is a composer, and therefore one of the elite. György observes the imperfection and compromise of the musical scale (as defined by Andreas Werckmeister a historical theorist). György proposes changes to the scale to make it more harmonious. György's utopian approach to music represents a flawed naive idealism that never can be achieved, it is not developed any further in the film or the book. It is just a statement that human governance will always be flawed. A less cryptic name for the film might be The Inevitably Flawed Paradox of Human Governance but that would destroy the enigma that this film is. It is an acknowledgement even when light of self government comes there will still be flaws because we are human.György's estranged wife tries to leverage her political and social status by giving György a list of names to sign up for the ""clean up the town movement"", this with the blessing of the police chief.However a stuffed smelly circus whale and its star performer, Prince, comes to town this is used a metaphor for a bloated political system and the unseen Prince who represents the power of politically inspired, emotive dogma.János philosophises about God and the beast (each viewer will interpret this differently).The post office workers are unsettled by the ominous disturbing signs of the circuses arrival and are disturbed by the cloud that settles over each town it visits (a reference to the spread of the externally imposed centralised monolithic government system onto the Soviet buffer nations, just after the war).György's struggling cobbler brother gets the list and passes it on to the agitated throbbing masses in the town square who are unhappy at public services failing.György's former wife sleeps with the drunk gun toting chief.The presence of the whale and the Prince stir up the masses.
János overhears the circus master losing control of his faceless Prince, who is becoming drunk with his own voice of revolutionary dogma. The circus master disowns him. The Prince, now free, inflames the masses.The people riot.The film is shot as a beautiful but disturbing visual poem. Long single shot scenes with a hypnotic and rhythmetic pace build up to the disconnected yet peaceful observation of the thuggish destruction of the hospital and its patents and the brutal inhumanity of the rioters, which almost seems normal and natural. You almost become one of the rioters as you get swept up in this pointless crowd-think not knowing or caring where it is going. Social upheaval does not always need a reason.When the rioters finally come to beating a helpless old naked patent they see their impotent sad and powerless selves. The sick helpless patents in the hospital are a mirror of the rioters themselves.After the riot János comes across the diary of a rioter it explains that the rioters did not know what they were angry with; so they were angry at everything, than it recounts the mobs horrendous rape of two working class post office girls.János comes across his killed cobbler uncle who got naively involved in the riot. János is told, by his cobbler uncles wife, to leave town for his own safety.He is intercepted by a helicopter. He finds himself committed to a mental institution with caged beds (a tool of the time for dealing with political dissidents). János appears drugged and broken.György his composer uncle is evicted from their society house but gets to live in a shed in the garden whilst György's former wife, with her new status as a collaborator, now occupies the big house with the police chief. The intelligentsia is displaced by political opportunism.György tells a vacant János, in the ward, that IF he is released from the mental institution they can live contentedly together in the shed with his piano, János just stares.It finishes with György looking directly into the eye of the whale than, walking away and looking back at the now sad and dishevelled whale, destroyed by the rioters the night before, its rotting carcass slowly enveloped by the fog which gets whiter and brighter.The camera pans up as warm bright sunlight returns............The director worked closely with the author. The book looks at the myopic petty interpersonal effects at roots of the situation however the film instead examines the overview of the forest. Like the film the book has paragraphs a chapter long. It spends 5 pages on a decaying corpse but not that of the whale.Gerard Hosier"

Trustworthy, caring and respectful, János enjoys a modest yet peaceful existence with his close knit, extended family. Undaunted by cosmic events that will soon overshadow the whole community, the artistically inspired János directs and narrates a performance for a motley crew of intoxicated misfits in a local bar. Shortly thereafter, a new exhibit featuring a great whale and a foreign prince arrives in town. Apparently, this public display has already caused much commotion in neighboring towns, and once again trouble appears to be brewing. Aunt Tünde tries to organize a committee to restore order. Uncle György, a reclusive reactionary, wants nothing to do with this 'media circus', but in order to avoid confronting his wife directly, he reluctantly agrees to be the chairman. János goes to see the whale and eventually realizes that the exhibit is indeed a diabolical threat to the community, but he still does not understand how or why. Events reach a frightening climax when a mob of angry citizens ransack a hospital. When all the smoke and debris has finally settled, János is left even more clueless than he had been to start. The film insinuates that the Soviets deliberately provoked social unrest in Hungary so as to provide context for a justifiable military takeover. Those who naively cooperated with the Soviets became puppets. Others who opposed the Soviets were either killed or ostracized. The big 'fish out of water' represents the elite members of Hungarian society, who were rendered utterly powerless and useless.::Anonymous"
"Katyn describes the tragedy of a generation. The film follows the story of four Polish families whose lives are torn apart when, at the outset of WWII, a great number of Polish soldiers (who are also fathers, husbands and brothers) fall into the hands of Soviet troops and later brutally become victims of Stalinism. The film also underlines the complicated circumstances of Poland's position both in the war and after. -tc-119""Katyn"" tells the story through the eyes of the women; the mothers, wives and daughters of the victims executed on Stalin's orders by the NKVD in 1940.The main male character is Andrzej (played by Artur Zmijewski), a young Polish captain in an Uhlan (light cavalry) regiment who keeps a detailed diary. He is taken prisoner by the Soviet Army, which separates the officers from the enlisted men, who are allowed to return home, while the officers are held. His wife Anna (played by Maja Ostaszewska) and daughter Weronika (""Nika"", played by Wiktoria Gsiewska) find him shortly before he is deported to the USSR. Presented with an opportunity to escape, he refuses on the basis of his oath of loyalty to the Polish military.Andrzej ends up in a prisoner of war camp, where he is kept for awhile and continues to keep his diary. He carefully records the names of all his fellow officers who are taken from the camp, as well as the dates they are taken. When winter comes, Andrzej is obviously suffering from the cold temperatures, and his colleague Jerzy (played by Andrzej Chyra) lends him an extra sweater. As it happens, the sweater has Jerzy's name written on it. Finally, it is Andrzej's turn to be taken from the camp, but Jerzy is left behind.At this point, the film fast-forwards to the post-WWII period back in Poland, when and where Andrzej's wife and daughter are still awaiting word about him. News of the Katyn massacre is reported, including the names of the victims, but Andrzej's name is not included in the list of victims, leading his wife and daughter hope that he was not among them. Jerzy, who has survived the war, has enlisted in the Peoples Army of Poland (LWP), which is now under control of the post-WWII communist government, but still feels personal loyalty to his friends, and like all Poles he loves his country and has sympathy for those who have suffered. He visits Anna and her daughter to tell them the news. Apparently, when the list of the names of the victims was compiled, Andrzej was misidentified as Jerzy on the basis of the name in the sweater that Jerzy had lent to Andrzej: it was Andrzej who was killed, not Jerzy.Evidence of Soviet responsibility for the Katyn massacre is carefully concealed by the authorities, but a few daring people working with the effects of the victims finally deliver Andrzej's diary to his widow Anna. The diary clearly shows the date in 1940 when he must have been killed from the absence of entries on subsequent days. The date when the massacre happened is crucial in assigning the responsibility for it: if it happened in 1940, the USSR had military control of the territory where it happened, while by 1941 the Germans had taken control of it.The film ends with a re-enactment of parts of the massacre.

An examination of the Soviet slaughter of thousands of Polish officers and citizens in the Katyn forest in 1940.::Anonymous
"When the Soviet Union on 17 September 1939 invades Poland, Anna Aleksandrowna leaves her home in Krakow to search for her husband, the Polish captain Andrzej. She finds him together with other officers captured by the Red Army, but some minutes later he is pushed into a train, which will take all the Polish officers to a prison camp in Kozelsk in Russia. Anna and her daughter Nika is now stuck in the Soviet occupied zone, unable to go back to Krakow in the German zone, not until a brave Russian captain helps them to flee. 3 April 1940 Andrzej is transported from the prison camp in Kozelsk to the Katyn Forest, where thousands of Polish officers are killed. In 1943 the Germans capture this area and find the mass graves. 13 April 1943 they start announcing the names of the identified corpses through loudspeakers in Krakow. Anna is happy that Andrzej is not in any of the Katyn lists, which gives her some hope. 18 January 1945 the Red Army liberates Krakow from the Nazis. The Russians start blaming the Katyn Massacre on the Germans, proclaiming that it happened in 1941 instead of 1940. Everybody knows that this isn't true, but those who refuse to accept the Soviet version are imprisoned or killed by the Red Army.::Maths Jesperson {maths.jesperson1@comhem.se}"

"This film is the story of the Bennet family, a middle-class family in England around 1800. The principal characters are:Mrs. Bennet (Brenda Blethyn), a hyperexcitable woman obsessed with getting at least one of her daughters into a financially advantageous marriage.Mr. Bennet (Donald Sutherland), who is relaxed, easygoing, and unflappable. He is somewhat amused by the high-spirited behavior of the rest of the family.Jane (Rosamund Pike), the oldest of the daughters. She is serious and thoughtful, but quite shy.Elizabeth (Lizzie) (Keira Knightley), the second daughter and the main character. She is wise, witty, and outspoken. She enjoys (and is very good at) verbal sparring and skirmishing with people.Mary (Talulah Riley), the third, not at all socially outgoing or interested in chasing men. She spends her time reading, playing the piano, and speaking of how much more interesting nature is than human society.Katherine (Kitty) (Carey Mulligan), like Lydia, is a boy-crazy teenager. The two of them are not interested in any serious pursuits; they just want to go to parties and dances. Kitty is impressionable and takes her cues from Lydia.Lydia (Jena Malone) is even more frivolous than Kitty.Charles Bingley (Simon Woods) is a wealthy and good-natured gentleman from London who moves into a nearby estate, causing great interest among the Bennets.Fitzwilliam Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen) is an extremely wealthy gentleman from the North of England. Unfortunately, he is ill-at-ease and inarticulate in social situations. He does not express himself well, and creates a bad impression on people.The reason that an advantageous marriage is important is that the house and land are covered by a covenant that would give it to the eldest male heir on Mr. Bennet's death, but, having no sons, it will go to their cousin, William Collins. This would leave the family destitute.
The film opens with a tracking shot of a green covered field on a sun-lit morning. Elizabeth ""Lizzie"" Bennet walks along the field finishing a book. Upon coming home, she overhears her mother telling her father excitedly that Netherfield, a nearby estate, has been rented by a Mr. Bingley, a wealthy gentleman from London. Mrs. Bennet begs Mr. Bennet to call on Mr. Bingley, believing him to be a very suitable match for any of her daughters. Mr. Bennett finally divulges that he has already met Mr. Bingley--he enjoys playing his low-key detached persona off of his wife's hyper-excitablility. When he says that they can all expect to see Mr. Bingley at an upcoming public ball, all of the Bennet daughters (who had been listening intently at the keyhole) squeal in excitement. Lizzie herself and the eldest sister Jane smile with pleasure, as the younger Lydia and Kitty jump up and down, and immediately begin to beg Jane to borrow her prettiest pair of shoes. Mary merely goes back to playing her piano. As Mr. Bennet leaves his study and sees that the five girls were all listening, he simply walks past them, amusedly saying ""Good heavens! People!""Later, at the public ball, the entire party is dancing, talking, and laughing; especially Lydia and Kitty, who seem to be giddy about being out in public in front of gentlemen. As Jane and Lizzie stand to the side observing the dance, Lizzie tells Jane that she has no intention of ever marrying. Jane disagrees and teases; ""One day, Lizzie, a man will catch your eye and then you will have to hold your tongue.""Suddenly, the room goes silent, as Mr. Bingley enters the hall along with his pretentious sister Caroline (Kelly Reilly), and his aloof, taciturn, and extremely wealthy friend Mr. Darcy. Mrs. Bennet, in her artless and self-conscious way, wastes no time in introducing her daughters to the newcomers. She also introduces Lizzie's close friend Charlotte Lucas (Claudie Blakley). While Mr. Darcy and Miss Bingley stare with an air of superiority, Mr. Bingley strikes up a conversation with Jane and Elizabeth. He is very affable and pleasant, and he and Jane take an immediate liking to each other. They dance with each other twice, to Mrs. Bennet's immense delight.Mr. Darcy, on the other hand, does not dance at all. He hardly speaks to anyone other than Charles and Caroline Bingley. Lizzie overhears him make a cruel remark about her, leaving her with a strong impression that he is ill-mannered. She later takes an opportunity to engage in some not-very-friendly verbal sparring with him. She comes away from the dance with as negative an impression of him as Jane's positive impression of Bingley.At one point during the dance, Kitty and Lydia run up breathlessly to their mother, telling her that they have heard that the militia are due to stay in their town over the winter. This means lots of opportunities to meet men.The next morning, Jane receives a letter from Caroline Bingley inviting her to dinner at Netherfield, though Charles will be away. Jane goes there, but catches a bad cold on the way, and must stay a few more days until she recovers. (Mrs. Bennet apparently planned the cold in advance, so that Jane would have to stay at the house while Mr. Bingley was there; she had made Jane go to Netherfield on horseback in a driving rainstorm.)Eliza, worried for her sister, walks the long distance in the muddy roads to Netherfield to visit Jane. When enters the reserved and elegant parlor with her hair down and wild, with muddy shoes and skirt, Caroline and Darcy looked shocked at her arrival and her appearance. Lizzie apologizes and inquires about her sister; Darcy brusquely replies that Jane is upstairs resting. Eliza is suprised a bit by the quick reaction, but then smiles and goes upstairs to Jane. As soon as she has left the room, Caroline Bingley quickly remarks how disheveled she looked, stating she ""was almost positively medieval.""Mr. Bingley is looking after Jane while she is ill. Lizzie stays for a couple of days. Judging by Mr Bingley's concern for her sister, and his fumbling words around her, Elizabeth is sure that Mr Bingley is in love with Jane.During an encounter in the sitting room, Caroline shows her pretentious and aristocratic attitudes. She makes increasingly brazen remarks about the unpolished behavior of the Bennet family and even Elizabeth. She also seems to share Lizzie's skill at verbal sparring, and the two of them make sharp comments to Darcy. Darcy quietly hears hers out her venom but doesn't respond. He seems to be truly offended by both of them.Mrs. Bennet and the other 3 daughters all come to Netherfield to pick up Lizzie and Jane. Mrs. Bennet urges Mr. Bingley to hold a dance soon, and he says that he will. While getting into the carriage, Elizabeth is shocked when Darcy takes her hand to help her into the carriage.Then the dreaded cousin William Collins (Tom Hollander), a minister, comes to visit the Bennets. He is extremely shallow, pompous, patronizing, boring, and conceited. He is attracted to influence and wealth, and engages in transparently foolish flattery. Dinner is very tense; the family sees right through him. Lizzie, in particular, does some verbal sparring with him.After dinner, he approaches Mrs. Bennet about marrying Jane; finding a wife among the sisters was the purpose of the visit. Mrs. Bennet says that Jane appears to be taken, but that Lizzie is available. She is delighted at the thought of one of her daughters marrying the man who will inherit the estate anyway.The next morning, the girls go out to see a parade of the militia; Kitty and Lydia are particularly interested in flirting with them. Later, they meet one of them, a handsome lieutenant named Wickham (Rupert Friend). They all go to a nearby store to buy ribbons for the upcoming dance. On their walk home they encounter Bingley and Darcy. Darcy and Wickham stare at each other coldly, and Darcy quickly leaves. There is some kind of intense antagonism between the two.After Darcy and Bingley leave, Elizabeth, confused by the men's reactions to each other, asks Wickham about this, and he explains that Darcy had cheated him out of Darcy's father's generous bequest to him. Elizabeth is amazed at the story, but is not entirely shocked, given Darcy's personality. Her opinion of Darcy goes even lower.The family goes to Bingley's dance. Lizzie is particularly interested in finding Wickham, but he isn't there, presumably because of the antagonism with Darcy. Collins asks Lizzie to dance with her, to her great disgust. He dotes on her, but she hardly even looks at him or speaks to him. Then Darcy appears, and asks Lizzie to dance. She accepts, and then hurries off with Charlotte for a quiet space. They laugh in disbelief, and Eliza, smiling, admits that ""this is most inconvenient"" as she had resigned herself to loathe him for all eternity. During the dance, she engages in intense verbal battle with him, mentioning Mr. Wickham. Darcy gets extremely uncomfortable, but it is clear that the tension in their manners might be due to attraction.Charlotte warns Lizzie that Jane should show more affection and attention to Mr Bingley, to encourage him. Elizabeth defends Jane, countering that Jane is reserved and shy, but feels that the attention is enough. Charlotte maintains that we are all fools in love.Caroline notices the many social gaffes and generally low-class behavior of the Bennets and their cousin Mr. Collins, and she makes various disparaging remarks about this to Darcy.Bingley smiles at Jane just before the Bennet's leave, and Caroline knows the look on her brother's face means only one thing...love, and if she is going to have anything about it; she has to act quickly. She doesn't want her brother to marry a Bennet.The next morning, Mr. Collins proposes to Lizzie, in the most pompous and conceited way imaginable. Lizzie, who utterly loathes him, rejects the proposal. Her sisters (listening at the door as usual) are delighted that she turned down the pompous ass. But Mrs. Bennet is horrified that any opportunity for marriage has been passed up, particularly with the man who will inherit the estate. She demands that Lizzie change her mind. But Mr. Bennet sides with Lizzie.A letter arrives from Caroline, saying that the Bingleys, and Darcy, are leaving Netherfield indefinitely. The letter indicates that it is so that Darcy can go back to be with his sister Georgiana. Lizzie realizes that Caroline dragged Bingley away so she could set him up with Darcy's younger sister. Jane resigns herself to the thought that perhaps Bingley just never loved her at all. Lizzie protests and says that she is certain Bingley does love her, and that she should not give up. Lizzie tells Jane to go to London and stay with their aunt and uncle, and she is sure that Bingley will send for her before the week is out. The family bids Jane farewell the next morning as she rides off to London to seek out her love.Charlotte Lucas comes to visit Lizzie and tell her that she is engaged to Mr. Collins. Lizzie is appalled that she would marry such a shallow man. Charlotte replies that she is desperate--she is 27 and in danger of becoming a penniless old maid if she does not find a financially secure husband soon.A few weeks later, Charlotte invites Lizzie to visit her at her new home with Mr. Collins. Lizzie sees that Charlotte is genuinely happy. Mr. Collins takes Lizzie and Charlotte to visit his neighbor and patron, the fabulously wealthy and aristocratic Lady Catherine DeBourg (Judi Dench), who is also Darcy's aunt. Mr. Collins is extremely fawning and obsequious toward her. Mr. Darcy, and his cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam (Cornelius Booth), are also there.Lady DeBourg is an incredibly haughty, arrogant, insolent, and overbearing person. At dinner, she quizzes Lizzie about her family. She is openly disdainful of the Bennets' lower class upbringing (specifically, not having had a governess), Lizzie's unseemly (to Lady Debourg) outspokenness, and the fact that the five girls were violating proper social protocol by all being ""out in society"" at the same time.After dinner, Lady DeBourg commands that Lizzie play the piano. Lizzie protests that she is a poor musician, but Lady DeBourg is not to be denied. While Lizzie is muddling her way through a piano piece, Darcy comes over, and the two of them engage in some verbal sparring. Fitzwilliam comes over and asks about Lizzie's impression of her earlier encounter with Darcy. Lizzie relates his seemingly antisocial behavior, not conversing or dancing with anyone. Darcy protests that he is not skilled in conversing with people to whom he has not been introduced. The verbal jabs continue. Darcy seems hurt by Lizzie's reproach.The next day, Mr. Darcy comes to the house, seeming to want to speak to Lizzie, but is then totally tongue-tied and unable to express himself. He leaves in an apparent state of confusion and agitation.During a boring church sermon by Mr. Collins, Lizzie and Colonel Fitzwilliam have a whispered conversation. Fitzwilliam reveals that Darcy, not Caroline, was the one who had separated Mr. Bingley from Jane.Later, in a shelter from a driving rainstorm, Darcy meets Lizzie and proclaims his love for her, saying that this is against his better judgement and despite her inferior social rank. An extremely bitter confrontation ensues. Lizzie denounces Darcy for his haughty demeanor and, more importantly, for interfering with Jane and Bingley. Darcy explains that he did this because he believed that Jane was not really interested in the relationship. Liz counters that Jane is simply very shy. ""My sister hardly shows her true feelings to me!"" Darcy also makes extremely disparaging comments about the remaining members of the Bennet family. Lizzie also brings up Mr. Wickham's claim that Darcy had cheated him out of his inheritance.Lizzie is so upset by this confrontation that she spends the rest of the day brooding about it back at the house. At nightfall, Darcy comes by and drops off a letter that he has written. Lizzie says nothing.In the letter, Darcy explains the relationship with Wickham. Darcy's father did indeed leave Wickham with a generous annual allowance. Wickham demanded, and received, the full principal, then gambled it away and came back for more. Darcy refused. Later, Wickham returned, and tried to elope with Darcy's sister Georgiana, to get her 30,000 pound inheritance. When he was told he would not get it, he disappeared. Darcy's letter also explains that Georgiana was only 15 at the time, and was thrown into a state of deep despair by this. Darcy explained that he had separated Jane from Bingley because he truly believed that he was helping his friend.Lizzie returns home. Jane is also home from London, having failed to find Mr. Bingley. She tells Lizzie, not very convincingly, that she is quite over her attraction to Bingley. She asks Lizzie whether there is any news from the visit with Charlotte. Lizzie say no; she lies. She specifically denies that Darcy had said anything about Bingley.Also, Lydia has been invited by a Colonel Forster to go on a trip to the South coastal resort at Brighton. Lizzie thinks it is a bad idea; Lydia is immature and impulsive, and could get into trouble. Lizzie pleads with her father to forbid it, and is furious when he doesn't.The Bennet sisters' aunt and uncle, Mr. (Peter Wight) and Mrs. (Penelope Wilton) Gardiner, are visiting, and will be going on a vacation in the Peak district to the North. They invite Lizzie to come with them, and she accepts.While on their travels, Lizzie's aunt and uncle suggest a visit to Pemberley, Darcy's grand estate, which is nearby and is open for visitors. Lizzie is reluctant to be anywhere near the man she hates, but consents to the trip when she is told that Darcy is away.Lizzie is utterly awed by the opulence and splendor of the house and grounds, particularly a sculpture gallery. The housekeeper tells the three visitors what a kind, caring, and generous person Mr. Darcy is. Lizzie begins to think that her earlier impression of him may have been wrong.Lizzie peeks into a room where a very young woman (who will turn out to be Darcy's younger sister Georgiana (Tamzin Merchant)) is playing the piano. She then sees Darcy enter, and he and the young woman welcome each other and embrace affectionately. Lizzie quickly leaves and goes outside. Darcy follows her and makes an awkward attempt to be conciliatory. He explains that he had returned from his trip early. He offers Lizzie a ride back to the inn where she is staying, but she declines, saying that she will walk.At dinner at the inn, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner tell Lizzie that Darcy had come to talk to them, seemed to be a very gracious person, and had invited them all to come back to Pemberley the next day, so that Mr. Gardiner could go fishing and Lizzie could meet Georgiana. They do so. When Lizzie and Georgiana meet, the latter says ""My brother has told me so much about you. I feel that we are friends already."" Darcy then flatters Lizzie into playing piano duets with the much more talented Georgiana. The interaction between Lizzie and Darcy is completely pleasant and amicable this time, the first time that this has happened. Darcy is finally learning how to speak in a pleasing way.The Gardiners, Lizzie, and Darcy all go to the inn that evening for dinner. Lizzie receives a letter with the shocking news that Lydia has run away with Mr. Wickham. Darcy blames himself for this, for not having exposed Wickham's perfidy sooner. He then leaves, and the others hurry back to the Bennet's home. Mr. Bennet has gone to London to try to find Lydia and Wickham, and force them to marry. The family is totally devastated--in that society, an incident like this brings ruin upon the entire family. None of them will be able to marry well, and they will lose the estate upon Mr. Bennet's death.Mr. Bennet returns, but Mr. Gardiner is still searching. Then a letter arrives: Mr. Gardiner has found them, and they will get married if Wickham is promised a settlement of 100 pounds per year. Mr. Bennet will pay it, but they are convinced that the actual demand must have been in the thousands, and that Mr. Gardiner is paying the bulk of it.The newlyweds then arrive for a visit before going to the North of England, where Wickham will be stationed. At lunch, Lydia lets slip what was supposed to be a secret--that Darcy was at the wedding, and was in fact the one who had found her and Wickham. Lizzie realizes that Darcy had been noble and generous toward the Bennet family, and that he must have been the one that paid off Wickham.The Bennets later learn that Mr. Bingley is returning to town. Jane assures Lizzie, not very convincingly, that she has completely gotten over caring about him. Mrs. Bennet also feigns indifference. A short time later, Mr. Bingley arrives at the house, with Darcy. (There is a humorous scene where the family frantically cleans up the messy living room, finishing in the nick of time.) Mrs. Bennet, while pretending to be indifferent, is clearly excited at the thought that Bingley will propose to Jane. But the visit is somewhat awkward to all concerned.Bingley and Darcy then walk a short distance from the house, and Darcy helps Bingley rehearse his proposal to Jane. Back at the house, Lizzie begins to realize that Darcy brought Bingley back to town, attempting to repair the damage that he had caused by separating them. She realizes that her negative impression of Darcy had been wrong.Bingley returns and proposes to Jane, and she accepts (with the whole family listening intently at the door, of course.)The Bennet family is ecstatic that evening, until there is a knock on the door. It is Lady DeBourg. After issuing a few insults, she imperiously demands to speak to Lizzie alone. She tells Lizzie that she has heard a rumor that her nephew Darcy and Lizzie are to be married. She is scandalized that he would ruin the family name by marrying into such a low-class family. She demands that Lizzie promise that the rumor is false, and that she will never marry Darcy. Lizzie refuses to do so, and tells Lady DeBourg to leave, an almost unheard-of breach of decorum toward the aristocracy.Lizzie had been unaware of the rumor, and realizes that it must have come from Darcy, and that it means that Darcy is genuinely interested in her. She is so upset at the encounter with Lady DeBourg that she can't sleep. Finally, just before dawn, she gets up and goes for a walk outside. She meets Darcy, also going for a walk. He hadn't been able to sleep either. When Lady DeBourg had reported to him Lizzie's refusal to deny the rumor, he realized that there was hope that Lizzie might marry him. He says that he hopes that her view of him has changed from their earlier encounters. He apologizes for his past behavior, saying ""You are too generous to trifle with me"", and proposes to her. Just at the instant the Sun is rising between them, she accepts.Later that morning, in Mr. Bennet's study, Darcy asks for Lizzie's hand in marriage. Then he leaves and Lizzie goes in to talk to her father. ""I thought you hated the man."" ""No, papa ... I was wrong. I was entirely wrong about him."" He gives his consent, saying ""I could not have parted with you, my dear Lizzie, to anyone less worthy."" After she leaves, Mr. Bennet, who has now had three of his five daughters engaged or married within a few days, calls out ""If any young men come for Mary or Kitty, for heaven's sake, send them in, I'm quite at my leisure."""

"The film starts with a naked man named Fenix, sitting in a tree in a mental asylum. Nurses come out to him, bringing a plate of conventional food, which he refuses. When he is offered the plate of a raw fish, Fenix descends from the tree and eats as the nurses get him to put on some overalls.Flashback
The film flashes back into Fenix's childhood, which he spent performing as a ""child magician"" in a circus run by his father Orgo, the knife-thrower, and his mother Concha, a trapeze artist and aerialist. The circus crew also includes, among others, a tattooed woman, who acts as the object of Orgo's knife-throwing feats, her adopted daughter Alma (a hearing-impaired, voiceless mime and tightrope walker whom Fenix fancies, with the feeling mutual), Fenix's dwarf friend Aladin, a pack of clowns and a small elephant. Orgo carries on a very public flirtation with the tattooed woman, and their knife-throwing act is heavily sexualized.Concha is also the leader of a religious cult that considers, as its patron saint, a little girl who was raped and had her arms cut off by two brothers. Their church is about to be bulldozed at the behest of the owner of the land, and the followers make one last stand against the police and the bulldozers. A Roman Catholic Monsignor drives into the conflict, saying that he will prevent its demolition, but after he enters the temple to inspect it he deems it blasphemous and unworthy (the girl worshipped is no saint, he says, and the supposed pool of ""holy blood"" at the center of the edifice contains just red paint), so the demolition is carried out. Fenix leads Concha back to the circus, where she finds out about Orgo's affair, but Orgo, being also a hypnotist, puts Concha in a trance and rapes her.The circus elephant then dies, much to Fenix's grief, and a public funeral is conducted, in which the elephant is paraded through the city inside a giant casket. The casket is then dropped into the city dump, where scavengers open it up and proceed to carve up the elephant and take away the meat. Orgo consoles his son by tattooing a spread-eagled phoenix onto his chest, identical to the one on his own chest, using a knife dipped in red ink. This tattoo, Orgo says, will make Fenix a man.Later on, Concha, during her trapeze act, sees Orgo and the tattooed woman sneak out of the big top. She chases after them and, seeing them sexually engaged, pours a bottle of sulphuric acid onto Orgo's genitals. Orgo retaliates by cutting off both her arms (much like the girl previously venerated). He then walks into the street and slits his own throat. Fenix witnesses this, locked inside a trailer. He then sees the tattooed woman driving off with Alma.Flash-forward
Back in the present, Fenix is taken out to a movie theater, along with other patients, most of whom have Down syndrome. A pimp intercepts them and persuades them to take cocaine and follow him to meet an overweight prostitute. Fenix then spots the Tattooed Woman, who is now a prostitute, and becomes filled with rage. Back in the asylum, Fenix's armless mother Concha calls out for him from the street and he escapes by climbing down a rope from his cell window. The Tattooed Woman is shown trying to prostitute Alma, who runs away and sleeps on the roof of a truck. The Tattooed Woman is then mutilated and killed by the hands of unseen woman.Mother and son go on to perform an act whereby he stands behind her and moves his arms so that they appear to be Concha's arms that are moving. But Concha soon starts to use her son's hands to kill those women whom she deems a threat to her, including a young performer that he kills with a knife-throw, as well as a cross-dressing wrestler, whom he slashes with a katana. A dream sequence subsequently shows that he has killed many more women, all of whose memories haunt him.Alma finds Fenix and together they plan to run away from Concha and her house. She tries to force Fenix to murder Alma as well, but, after a struggle, he manages to plunge a knife into Concha's stomach. Yet she does not die but taunts him by saying she will always be inside him as she vanishes before his eyes. Through a quick series of flashbacks, it is revealed that Concha actually died after being maimed by Orgo, and that Fenix has actually kept a mannequin of his armless mother for performing on stage and at home, which also now appears in reality to be a thoroughly dilapidated house. He destroys the home-made temple and throws away the mannequin with the help of his imaginary childhood friends, Aladin and the clowns.Alma proceeds to lead Fenix outside the house where police are waiting and order them to put up their hands. As they both comply, Fenix watches his own hands in awe as he does so. And Fenix's realization that he has finally regained control of them brings him joy and peace."

"A young man -- starving, nearly catatonic and barely responsive -- is confined in a sanitarium. He is taken on a field trip along with other residents to the city's red-light district. There, he encounters by chance a woman from his past, triggering a series of flashbacks. We see that he was traumatized as a child, when he and his family were circus performers, and when he witnessed a murder/suicide: his father -- an American expatriate living in Mexico under suspicious circumstances -- cuts off the arms of his beloved mother, a possessive wife and religious fanatic who led a heretical church called ""Santa Sangre (Holy Blood),"" the members of which worshipped a martyred girl whose arms were severed by her father following her rape, and then commit suicide. Back in the present, buttressed by shock of his remembrance, he escapes the sanitarium and, in a series of hallucinations and dream-fulfillments, believes he has rejoined his armless mother.

"On July 29, 1939, renowned British big game hunter Captain Alan Thorndike (Walter Pidgeon) slips through the forest undetected near the Berghof, Adolf Hitler's residence near Berchtesgaden. Getting the dictator in his telescopic sight, he pulls the trigger on his unloaded rifle and gives a wave. He ponders a moment, then loads a live round, but is discovered at the last second by a guard, and the shot goes wild.After being beaten up, Thorndike is taken to Major Quive-Smith (George Sanders). Quive-Smith is also a devoted hunter and an admirer of Thorndike. Thorndike explains that it was a ""sporting stalk"", not to kill, but just for the thrill of going after the biggest game of all. The Nazi half-believes him, but insists he sign a confession that he was in fact working for His Majesty's government. When Thorndike refuses, he is tortured, but remains steadfast and warns of ""questions being asked in high places"" if he is killed, as his brother, Lord Risborough (Frederick Worlock), is a very important diplomat. The phrase gives Quive-Smith the idea to have Thorndike thrown off a cliff to make his death look like an accident.Thorndike survives when his knapsack gets caught in a tree, breaking his fall. He eludes his German pursuers and reaches a port. He steals a rowboat, but is forced to abandon it hastily when a patrol boat comes near. He swims to a Danish ship about to sail for London. Vaner (Roddy McDowall), the English cabin boy, helps Thorndike hide. The Germans find Thorndike's coat and passport aboard the rowboat and search the nearby ship. Though they find nothing, they place agent Mr. Jones (John Carradine) on board using Thorndike's passport to continue looking even after the ship leaves the harbor.Jones is met by German agents in London. Thorndike, mistakenly believing he is now safe, casually debarks and is spotted. He manages to shake off his pursuers by ducking into the apartment of Jerry Stokes (Joan Bennett), a young woman. Jerry lends him money so he can reach his brother.When Lord Risborough tells his brother that the British government, continuing its pre-war policy of appeasement, would have to extradite him if he were found, Thorndike decides to hide in Africa. Jerry tries to refuse a large cash reward, leading Lady Risborough (Heather Thatcher) to assume that it is payment for other services, but Thorndike insists. He also buys her a new hatpin, as she had lost hers when they first met. She chooses a cheap chromium arrow and insists Thorndike present it to her. Thorndike likens it to her, saying both are ""straight and shiny"". By this point, Jerry is in love.Quive-Smith arrives in London to join the hunt. When Thorndike calls on his solicitor, Saul Farnsworthy (Holmes Herbert), the Nazis are once again on his trail. Chased into a London Underground station, Thorndike struggles with Jones, who is killed when he is thrown onto an electrified rail.Thorndike tells Jerry to have Lord Risborough send him a letter in three weeks time care of Lyme Regis Post Office. Thorndike hides in a cave. However, when he goes to pick up the letter, the postmistress (Eily Malyon) seems alarmed and sends a girl on an errand. Thorndike grabs the letter and beats a hasty retreat. Back at his cave, he finds the letter is from Quive-Smith, who has followed him to his lair.Quive-Smith seals the only entrance and passes his quarry the confession and a pen through an air hole, threatening to leave him trapped inside. Quive-Smith also slides in Jerry's beret with the arrow pin, informing Thorndike that his men murdered Jerry by throwing her out a window to her death when she would not betray him. They only discovered Thorndike's location through the address he had written down for her. Badgered by the Nazi, the grief-stricken Thorndike finally admits that he subconsciously intended to assassinate Hitler after all. He then agrees to sign the confession. Quive-Smith unblocks the entrance, but waits to shoot him as he crawls out. Thorndike however has other plans; he uses his belt, a slat from his bed, and a stick to fabricate a bow, using Jerry's pin as the tip of a makeshift arrow, and shoots the German through the air hole. When Thorndike emerges, Quive-Smith manages to wound him before dying. By the time Thorndike recovers, the war has started (September 1, 1939).Over one year later, Thorndike joins the R.A.F. as a Bomber Command crewman.

"Pagan Rome, 37 A.D. Prince Gaius Germanicus ""Caligula"" (Latin term for 'Little Boots') (Malcolm McDowell) the 24-year-old young heir to the throne of the syphilis-ridden, 77-year-old, half-mad Emperor Tiberius (Peter O'Toole), thinks he has received a bad omen after a blackbird flies into his room early one morning. Shortly afterward, Macro (Guido Mannari), the head of the Praetorian Guards, appears to tell the young man that his great uncle (Tiberius) demands that he report at once to the Island of Capri, where he has been residing for a number of years with close friend, Senator Nerva (John Gielgud), Claudius (Giancaro Badessi), a dim-witted relative, and Caligula's younger stepbrother, Gemellus (Bruno Brive), Tiberius' favorite. Fearing assassination, Caligula is afraid to leave, but his beloved sister Drusilla (Teresa Ann Savoy) convinces him to go. Macro seeks to curry favor with Caligula, who will be the next Emperor, by tempting him with the promise of sleeping with his wife Ennia (Adriana Asti).At Capri, Caligula finds his uncle has become depraved, showing signs of advanced venereal diseases, and embittered with Rome and politics. Tiberius enjoys watching degrading sexual shows, often including children and various freaks of nature in his underground grotto. Caligula observes with a mixture of fascination and horror. Tiberius demands his grandson perform a dance from his youth when he was a mascot in his father's army. At first, Caligula claims to have forgotten, but Tiberius angrily insists. After a few minutes, Tiberius interrupts, and confronts Caligula about gossiping and praying for his grandfather's death. Caligula denies the accusations. Soon, Tiberius warns Nerva to be wary of Macro after his death. Tiberius embraces Caligula, and cautions him that it is a myth that emperors are gods. Tiberius is curious to know if he is missed in Rome, and Caligula assures him that he is loved. Tiberius believes he is not loved but feared. He cautions Caligula that every senator aspires to be emperor, and therefore is a traitor. Caligula denies being intimate with Drusilla, but Tiberius warns him that he knows everything that goes on in the kingdom. Soon, Tiberius greets a biological grandson, Gemellus, with affection. He offers Caligula a cup of wine, but Caligula passes the cup to Gemellus. However, Tiberius stops Gemellus from drinking, and warns him that Caligula will kill him once Tiberius is dead. A servant drinks the poisonous cup of wine and expires.Later, Caligula wakes from a nightmare, and tells Drusilla that Tiberius plots to kill him, but she reassures him he is the only one who can be emperor because Gemellus is too young to rule and Uncle Claudius is not mentally fit. Caligula wants Drusilla to be his empress, but she reminds him that he has been promised to Macro's wife, Ennia. Even Macro agrees with the arrangement.Meanwhile, Nerva chooses suicide over a natural death by slashing his wrists in a bath. Tiberius discovers Nerva in the midst of his suicide. As Tiberius orders his wounds bound, Nerva admits that he hates his life. Tiberius says he cannot live without Nerva at his side, and promises to kill Macro, but even with Macro gone, Nerva does not want to be ruled by ""the reptile"" Caligula. Nerva begs to be allowed to die, and Tiberius leaves. Meanwhile, Caligula wants to know what dying is like, and asks Nerva if he can see the goddess Isis. When he cannot, Caligula believes he is lying, pushes him down in the tub, and hastens his death.Late one night, Macro escorts all the spectators out of Tiberius' bedchamber to allow Caligula the opportunity to murder his grandfather, but when Caligula fails and falls into an epileptic trance, Macro finishes the deed himself by strangling Tiberius with a scarf. Caligula triumphantly removes the imperial signet from Tiberius' finger and suddenly realizes that Gemellus has witnessed the murder.Back in Rome several days later, Tiberius is buried with honors and Caligula is proclaimed the new Emperor, who in turn proclaims Drusilla his equal, to the apparent disgust of the Roman Senate. Afterwards, Drusilla, fearful of Macro's influence, convinces Caligula to get rid of him. Caligula obliges by setting up a mock trial, in which Gemellus is intimidated into testifying that Macro alone murdered Tiberius. Caligula then has Macro's wife, Ennia, arrested for ""insubordination"" and has her exiled to Gaul, never to be seen or heard of again.Macro is then executed in Caligula's public courtyard by a large decapitation machine; Macro and other convicts are buried up to their necks in the earth ground, and the blade-slashing machine, standing over 100-feet tall and wide as a city block, runs over him. At one point Caligula, when booed by the crowd, mutters ""If only all of Rome had but one neck...""With the powerful Macro gone, Caligula appoints Tiberius' former financial and political adviser Longinus (John Steiner) as his new adviser and right-hand man, and pronounces the docile Senator Chaerea (Paolo Bonacelli) as the new head of the Praetorian Guard. Drusilla endeavors to find Caligula a wife amongst the priestesses of the goddess Isis, the mystery cult they secretly practice. Disguised as a woman, Caligula chooses a candidate from among the shapely priestesses in the Temple of Isis. He is attracted, despite Drusilla's protests that she is promiscuous, to Caesonia (Helen Mirren), an eloquent, sensual divorcee, who becomes his mistress.Over the next several months, Caligula proves to be a popular, yet eccentric ruler, cutting taxes and overturning all the oppressive laws that Tiberius enacted. One of Caligula's first duties is to settle a land dispute between two senators. Instead of listening to arguments, he makes an arbitrary decision based on the size of the legal documents. Within a few months, the Roman Senate begins to dislike the young emperor for his eccentricities and various insults directed towards them. Darker aspects of his personality begin to emerge as well. When Caligula eyes a young woman named Livia (Mirella D'Angelo), whom is engaged to Proculus (Donato Placido), one of his most loyal soldiers, Caligula and his entourage crashes Livia and Proculus wedding party where he lures both to the kitchen and rapes both of them in a minor fit of jealousy. Proculus is later disemboweled and castrated in a gory torture-murder by Caligula himself. When asked why he murdered one of his most loyal officers, Caligula's insane reply is: ""because I can.""The much darker side of Caligula begins to show itself as he comes to realize that no one will challenge his absolute power. His terror during a thunder and lightning rainstorm is the first sign of a mental breakdown; his reaction is to run outside and dance naked. As Drusilla is summoned, Caligula tells her that he knows Gemellus plots to kill him. She kisses away his fears, and soon, Caligula is making love to both Drusilla and Caesonia. In another bedchamber, two Isis women, Messalina and Agrippina, watch the threesome unfolding and then engage in lesbian sex with each other.Over the next few months, Caligula's actions become increasingly senseless. His only confidant is his Arab stallion, Incitatus, which he rides into a banquet where Gemellus is one of the guests. In a macabre mood, Caligula accuses Gemellus publicly of treason and has him arrested merely to provoke a reaction from Drusilla. Caligula defends his increasingly erratic and outspoken actions as he is the Emperor of the Roman Empire and he feels that he can do anything he wants with impunity.After he discovers Caesonia is pregnant, Caligula suffers a severe fever, but Drusilla nurses him back to health. Right after he recovers, Caesonia bears Caligula a daughter, whom they name Julia Drusilla, and Caligula marries her on the spot. He is enraged to learn the child is a girl and insists on calling her ""my son."" During the celebration, Drusilla collapses in Caligula's arms from the same fever he'd suffered. Soon afterward, Caligula receives another ill omen in the guise of a black bird. He rushes to Drusilla's side and watches her die. Caligula experiences a nervous breakdown, smashes a statue of Isis and drags Drusilla's nude body around the palace while screaming hysterically.Now in a deep depression, Caligula walks the Roman streets, disguised as a beggar. When Caligula is dragged drunk and dirty into a prison for causing a disturbance at an outdoor theater, his signet ring is spotted by a giant (Osiride Pevarello) and his true identity becomes known. Caligula is released and has the Giant become his companion and 'flunky'.After his brief stay in jail, Caligula becomes determined to destroy the senatorial class, which he has come to loathe. Over the next year, his reign becomes a series of humiliations against the foundations of Rome. He orders the execution of several senators and their families without the slightest provocation.Caligula officially proclaims himself a god and awards free games and food to every citizen for one month. When Longinus protests by saying that the economy will never be able to handle such an expense, Caligula shows him how easy it is to replenish the Imperial purse. He builds a large ship in the palace that is to be used as a brothel. Forcing the wives and daughters of his senators into prostitution, Caligula himself collects the fees from citizens eager to sample their betters.Afterward, estates are confiscated, the old pagan religion is desecrated, and Caligula initiates an absurd war on Britain to humiliate the army. Caligula orders his officers to attack papyrus growing in the water of a lake so he can claim to have conquered Britain. Back in court, he announces his victory while servants parade the captured papyrus. During a celebration, Caligula orders Longinus to recite a list of citizens who have failed the empire, and they are arrested. His final public act of madness is to proclaim his horse, Incitatus, a senator.Having overruled every branch of the government, mocked the Roman gods, humiliated and killed all of the most loyal and trusted members of the Senate, destiny finally catches up with Caligula; Chaerea, Longinus, the Imperial physician Charicles (Leopoldo Trieste), the Chief Executioner, the Roman High Priest, and a few other senators and members of the Praetorian Guard have quietly begun plotting his assassination.On the last night of his life, Caligula wanders into his bedroom where a nervous Caesonia awaits him. The black bird makes a final appearance, but only Caesonia is frightened of it. By this point, Caligula is so consumed by his insanity that he no longer exhibits fear or any kind of strong emotions.The next day, on a cold January morning in 41 A.D., after rehearsing an Egyptian play, Caligula and his family leave the stadium to return to the Imperial Palace. On their way back, a vengeful Chaerea awaits them in the front corridor. Caligula gives Chaerea the secret password ""scrotum."" Chaerea answers, ""So be it!""... draws his sword and strikes Caligula on his head. To insure that none of Caligula's line will follow him to power, Caesonia is also stabbed, the child Julia has her head smashed on the marble steps by the Executioner, and the Giant is decapitated by Chaerea. Deranged to the last, the mortally wounded and bloodied Caligula rises to his feet and to which he defiantly whimpers: ""I live!"" Chaerea responds by stabbing Caligula a final time and he falls to the floor. Caligula is finished off when 10 or more of his own guards, seeing their now-hated Emperor dying, gorily stab him to the marble floor with their spears while the horrified Claudius watches. Begging to spare his life, Claudius is given Caligula's robe and ring by Longinus and the servants who hail him as the new Emperor, proclaiming a new era for the Roman Empire. As the unwilling and dull-witted Claudius is carried away, Chaerea, Longinus, and the other conspirators flee the scene of the crime.As the servants wash the blood off the palace floor following the assassinations, the mutilated and lifeless bodies of Caligula, Caesonia, their daughter, and the Giant's severed head are thrown down the marble steps of the Palace for display to all those in Rome."

"Ben Sanderson (Cage) is a Hollywood agent who has lost everything because of his alcoholism. He loses his job, his family, and decides to commit suicide by alcohol consumption in Las Vegas. After arriving, he meets Sera (Shue), a prostitute, and a deep friendship and understanding develops between them.The movie begins with Ben 'first' shopping for beer, then, in a restaurant. He borrows some money from his colleague Peter (Richard Lewis), and then proceeds directly to a bar and starts drinking. He attempts to pick up a pretty girl (Valeria Golino) and fails. After leaving the bar he visits a prostitute, and succeeds only in getting his wedding ring stolen. He is fired from his job for alcohol related issues and is given a large severance package. When his boss asks him what he is going to do next, Ben responds ""I thought I'd move out to Las Vegas"". He goes home and starts emptying his house by stuffing bedding in garbage bags, and creating a bonfire in his backyard on which he burns photographs, clothes, passport and other possessions. He then leaves for Las Vegas. As he drives his BMW drunkenly down the Las Vegas Strip, he almost hits a woman in the crosswalk (who turns out to be Sera) who chastises him. Ben checks himself into a sleazy motel called The Whole Year Inn. However, as he looks at this the wording changes to ""The Hole You're In"".Sera (Elisabeth Shue) is a Las Vegas prostitute who works for a pimp, Yuri Butso (Julian Sands), a Latvian immigrant. Yuri and Sera ""share a volatile relationship where Yuri is the dominator and Sera is the masochist.""[2] Polish mobsters are after Yuri for an unknown matter; therefore, Yuri breaks his relationship with Sera in fear that the Poles may hurt her. It frees Sera to continue to build her relationship with Ben.On his second day in Las Vegas, Ben finds Sera, on the same street where he met her, introduces himself and offers her $500 to go to his room for an hour. Sera agrees to go to his room, but she gets confused when Ben does not want to have sex with her. Instead, they just talk, and in the process they create an odd relationship with each other. Their relationship, however, is ultimately doomed; Sera has to promise Ben that she will never ask him to stop drinking, and Ben is not allowed to criticize Sera's occupation. At first the two are generally stable. Ben states that he is ""totally at ease with this (Sera's prostitution)."" However, after spending some time together, they both become more and more frustrated with the other's behavior. Over time, Sera attempts to get Ben to eat healthily but Ben refuses to even notice these actions as he stumbles for more alcohol. Finally, Sera becomes so fed up with Ben's alcoholism that she begs him to see a doctor. Ben, furious but far too intoxicated to express his feelings, goes out and brings another prostitute (played by Mariska Hargitay) back to Sera's house. Sera returns home to find them together and throws Ben out. Shortly afterwards, she is raped and beaten by three teenagers, and the injuries she sustains make her occupation publicly obvious. After being evicted, Sera receives a telephone call from Ben, who is on his deathbed. She goes to visit Ben and they have sex. They fall asleep, and when Ben wakes up, he looks across at Sera, who is lying on top of him, and dies while holding her as she sleeps."

"For the past year, Fox Mulder has been investigating the murders of six people in two states. The murderers have finally reappeared in Los Angeles after three months of inactivity. These murderers strike only at night, leaving their victims drained of blood through bite wounds on the exterior jugular and medial cubital veins. They smash every mirror in the house and they write on the walls with the victims' blood. ""He who eats of my flesh and drinks of my blood shall have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day"" [John 6:54, incorrectly shown as John 52:54]. Mulder thinks that they see themselves as an ""unholy trinity"" because the murders come in threes. In each case, the first is a father, the second a son, and the third a holy spirit. In Memphis, they murdered a father of three, a Korean woman named Linda Sun, and a Jesuit theologian. In Portland, they murdered a priest, the eldest son of six, and the owner of a New Age bookstore called ""Holy Spirit."" Their latest victim was the father of three boys. Mulder expects that there will be two more murders and then the unholy trinity will drop out of sight again.Mulder's latest lead says that they are working at a local blood center. He starts phoning blood centers under guise of a payroll service looking for the W-4 form of a recent hiring. He hits pay dirt at the Hollywood Blood Bank when he hears of Frank, the newly-hired night watchman. That night, Mulder goes snooping and apprehends Frank [Frank Military] in the basement, drinking a pint of blood. Frank is taken to the LAPD, but the interrogation lights have him cowering in a corner until Mulder brings in a red light and turns off the overhead lights. Frank admits to being a vampire and calls himself ""the Son,"" but he won't tell Mulder where his partners are, so Mulder has him placed in a cell with windows facing the morning sunrise, going along with what Mulder thinks is Frank's delusion. Astonishingly, when the morning sun enters the cell, Frank burns up.Mulder notices an inkstamp on the back of Frank's burned hands. The stamp reads ""Club Tepes,"" a local nightspot on Hollywood Blvd. That evening, Mulder stops at the club and meets Kristen Kilar [Perrey Reeves], who has no compulsion against showing Mulder how she pricks her finger with a hypodermic needle in order to get blood. When Mulder refuses to lick her finger, she offers it to another man, David Yung [Richard Yee.] Mulder follows Kristen and Yung to a restaurant called ""Ra,"" where he finds them in a back room, cutting each other and licking up the blood. A car pulls up, and Kristen and Yung see Mulder looking in the window. Yung knocks Mulder to the ground and informs him that he and Kristen are consenting adults. When Yung returns to the back room, Kristen has disappeared. Yung is suddenly attacked and murdered by vampires.A cursory examination by the county coroner reveals that the bites on Yung's body were made by three different people. Fingerprints taken at the scene lead Mulder to Kristen's house in Malibu Canyon. Further investigation of her previous addresses reveal that she was also living in both Portland and Memphis at the time that the vampire murders were committed there. Accompanied by several LAPD officers, Mulder searches Kristen's house, finding hypodermic needles and a snakebite suction cup used to extract blood. When Mulder finds a blood-filled loaf of bread in the oven, which he recognizes as an Eastern European protection against vampires, he tells the officers that Kristen has gone and is not coming back. Then he sits down and waits.When Kristen returns, Mulder asks how she's connected with the murders. Kristen tells him how, as a young girl, she was beaten by her father until the taste of her own blood was the only thing that told her she was alive. When she met John aka The Son aka Frank, he beat her, too. One time he split open her lip, so she bit his in retaliation. They tasted each other's blood, and from that point on, they got into blood sports. One night John came home with two others, real vampires. Kristen decided to leave John and moved to Memphis. They followed. She moved to Portland. They followed. She tells Mulder that she's tired of running from them. Mulder informs her that John is dead. Without John in the group, she doesn't think they will continue to come after her, but Mulder warns that the group seems to have picked up a third person and volunteers to stay with Kristen to protect her (not to mention that he's smitten with her). Kristen lets him get cleaned up and they make love, not realizing that John is watching them from outside the window.Just before sunrise, Kristen goes into the kitchen. John sneaks up behind her. He tells her how he was able to come back from the dead and offers the same to Kristen if she will only drink Mulder's blood. You have to drink the blood of a believer, John tells her, and Mulder knows what we are. He then puts a butcher knife in Kristen's hand and orders her to kill Mulder, but Kristen can't do it. Instead, she wakes up Mulder, tells him he must leave, and offers him her car. Then she uses the knife to kill the Father vampire, who was hiding in a dark corner. When Kristen tells Mulder that John is still alive, they go looking for him. John jumps Kristen and knocks her head against the wall. Mulder jumps John and ties him up. Then he and Kristen get into the car. Just as they're about to drive away, the Unholy Spirit female vampire jumps on the roof of the car. She smashes the sunroof and hauls Mulder out by his shirt collar. Kristen takes the wheel and drives the car into the Unholy Spirit, impaling her on a wall peg.Kristen refuses to leave without John, so Mulder runs back into the house to get him. Suddenly, he hears the tires squealing, so he runs back outside to find the car parked at the end of the driveway with no Kristen in sight. Kristen is back in the house, spilling gasoline around. John taunts her about drinking the blood of a believer, so she slathers her hand with her own blood from the back of her head and licks it. Then he taunts her about having to take a life before she can be turned into a real vampire, so she lights a match and tosses it on the gasoline while saying, ""I'll take mine."" From out in the yard, Mulder watches helplessly as the house explodes into flames.Epilogue: Firefighters cleaning up after the fire inform Mulder that they found four bodies, all reduced to ashes.

"In some abstract war, a military patrol consisting of four men: Air Force pilot Lieutenant Corby (Kenneth Harp), Sergeant Mac (Frank Silvera), and Privates Sidney (Paul Mazursky) and Fletcher (Steve Colt) find themselves six miles behind enemy lines after their plane has crashed.They advance into a forest where Corby decides to journey to a nearby river which runs through the front lines where they can make a raft and get back to friendly territory. Upon reaching the river, the four men cut down some trees to make a log raft, but are forced to run for cover when an ememy airplane flies overhead and lands in a nearby airfield where they notice that a high ranking military general is.That evening, while treking through the forest, they stumble upon a cabin where a couple of enemy soldiers are having dinner. They break in and take the enemy soldiers by suprise and kill them both, taking their rifles and weapons. The teenage soldier, Sidney, is traumatized from this act of violence and from there begins a slow slide into insanity.The next morning, the four soldiers encounter a local, young girl (Virginia Leith) and take her hostage. Afraid that she will inform on them since she is an enemy local, they tie her to a tree. Sidney stands guard over her while his three comrades proceed to the river to recon the area and to secure their log raft which will take them home. Sidney becomes more insane and attempts to sexually assault the tied up young woman by unting her which gives her a chance to escape when she pushes him aside and runs. Sidney is forced to shoot her in the back, killing her. Mac comes on the scene and seeing that Sidney has killed their hostage, begins to realize that Sidney has been dehumantized by this ordeal, but before he attempts to stop him, Sidney runs off into the forest, rambling incoherently.Later, Corby, Mac and Fletcher decide to leave the insane Sidney behind and sail down river towards the front lines, but Mac persuades Corby to turn back and kill the enemy general at the command post and steal the general's light aircraft to fly home. Realizing that the light plane is a two-seater meaning that only two of them can go, Mac volunteers to create a diversion while Corby and Fletcher commandeer the plane to fly back to friendly lines.That evening, Mac rows the log raft towards the enemy command post while Corby and Fletcher sneak up to wait until all the enemy sentries will move from the front of the house so they can storm in and kill the general. In the command post house, the enemy general (also Kenneth Harp in a dual role) and his aide-de-camp (also Steve Colt) talk amongst themselves over the general's pet dog whom his aide found lost in the woods (the same dog that the four soldiers encountered earlier), while the general talks about the troubles of his command and of his waiting for something to happen.Mac opens fire on the enemy command post from his raft on the river. The ruse works as the enemy soldiers line up along the banks and return fire, wounding Mac, but leaving the front of the house unguarded. Corby and Fletcher then go to the window where the general and captain are and shoot them both dead. Both of them briefly remark how the enemy officers look so much like them. Corby and Fletcher make it to the small plane and take off back to home. Meanwhile on the raft, the wounded Mac encounters Sidney, whom is still insane and asks Mac to take him home.The next day, Corby and Fletcher, having made it back to friendly territory and given their statement to their interogating officer, go to the riverbank to wait for Mac to show up. The four men are finally reunited when the raft arrives on the riverbank, except that Mac is practially dead from his wounds, while the deranged Sidney continues to ramble incoherently about the trees and the ""magician"" of the forest."

"A ficticious war in an unidentified country provides the setting for this drama. Four soldiers survive the crash-landing of their plane to find themselves in a forest six miles behind enemy lines. The group, led by Lt. Corby, has a plan: They'll make their way to a nearby river, build a raft, and then, under cover of night, float back to friendly territory. Their plans for getting back safely are sidetracked by a young woman who stumbles across them as they hide in the woods, and by the nearby presence of an enemy general who one member of the group is determined to kill.::Eugene Kim <genekim@concentric.net>"
"Lieutenant Corby, Sergeant Mac and Privates Fletcher and Sidney are in the woods somewhere behind enemy lines after their plane goes down. Although Mac in particular does not fully trust Corby, blaming him for their predicament, they have no other option but to follow his orders as the ranking personnel and only officer. Corby guesstimates that they are about six miles from the line and that there is a river nearby which flows downstream past the line. They can only believe that there is no rescue team looking for them, and that the enemies know they are still alive somewhere in the woods in their territory. Corby's plan is for them to head toward where he believes the river to be, build a raft, then wait for nightfall under the cover of darkness when they would drift down the river to safety. What happens to the collective is largely affected by who they are individually as people and soldiers. Corby is the type who takes the safe course of action. Mac is the career soldier, one who wants to seize upon opportunity for the greater war good. Fletcher is the quiet soldier who dutifully obeys orders, but not without fear. And Sidney is slowly unraveling in his shell shocked state. But what happens to them is also affected by who and what they encounter along the way, chief among these unknowns being what looks to be an enemy airfield commanded by a general, and small group of young women they believe are gathering food to feed the enemy officers at the airfield.::Huggo"

"Anthology film from three European directors based on stories by Edgar Allan Poe: a cruel princess haunted by a ghostly horse, a sadistic young man haunted by his double, and an alcoholic actor haunted by the Devil."
"Three directors each adapt a Poe short story to the screen: ""Toby Dammit"" features a disheveled, drugged and drunk English movie star who nods acceptance in the Italian press and his producers fawn over him. ""Metzengerstein"" features a medieval countess who has a love-hate relationship with a black stallion - who, it turns out, is really her dead lover. ""William Wilson"" tells the story of a sadistic Austrian student with an exact double whom he later kills.::alfiehitchie"
"Three short stories by Edgar Allan Poe are adapted for the screen, each under the helm of a different filmmaker. In ""Metzengerstein"", the Contessa Frederique de Metzengerstein is a wealthy, depraved and cruel young woman, whose actions are for her own amusement regardless of the affect they have on other people. Her cousin, Baron Wilhelm Berlifitzing, is her closest neighbor, although the two do not really know each other. Unlike Frederique, Wilhelm is a content and happy person. Upon first sighting, Frederique becomes obsessed with her cousin. An incident initiated by Frederique that affects Wilhelm directly has a profound effect on her psyche, which is only strengthened with the arrival of a wild black stallion into her life, from where the stallion came no one knows. In ""William Wilson"", a young non-Cathloic man named William Wilson feels the need to confess to a Catholic priest of a murder he just committed. His story starts as a boy when he was a cadet in a military school, he a sadistic person who tormented those classmates with who he had issue, with many of his other classmates mindlessly following him in not wanting to face his wrath. He brings his sadistic behavior into adulthood, first as a medical student, then as a military man in the Austrian army. But it is someone from his childhood who follows him, in body and/or spirit, that may ultimately be William's match. In ""Toby Dammit"", the title character, a British Shakespearean actor, has just landed in Rome where he is scheduled to film a movie, in the role of Christ in the first ever Catholic western. He is unabashedly self-indulgent and has open contempt for the business, even for his fans. He is also neurotic and tormented, he who copes with excessive alcohol.

"The film opens at Devon School. Gene Forester and his roommate Finny are in their room one night, Finny sleeping, Gene reading, when Brinker Haldey and several other boys take them out of their room. Somebody from down the hall watches the entire thing. The boys are delivered to a mock trial. Finny complains stating that there's nothing to investigate.Flashback to several months earlier. Gene arrives at the prestigious Devon Prep school and contemplates how he arrived on the same level as these rich kids. He meets his roommate, Finny, a good looking athlete, and his friends Brinker, the top of the class, and Leper, who shows Gene his snail collection and snail house.The boys make up a game called Blitz Ball, in which there are no rules and Finny makes it up as he goes along. They arrive at a tree, where seniors are practicing jumping out of enemy troopships under the aid of the ancient Fitzwinkler. The seniors leave and Finny decides to jump from the tree like the seniors. He coaxes Gene into following suit and tells him that rules are made to be broken.Gene soon discovers through his teachers that his grades are not up to the Devon standards, and so, pushes harder to study. One night, Finny decides to put the radio on, distracting Gene. Brinker and Leper appear dressed like Nazis, Leper like Adolf Hitler, and they dance and make fun of the Germans.At a headmaster tea, Gene watches Finny show off his outlandish pink shirt and tie which he used as a belt to the headmaster. He gets away with it, and the two go to jump some more from the tree. They decide to make a ""suicidal"" society where the students all jump out of the tree. Gene pulls his grades up.Finny invites Gene to go swimming with him and he beats the school record for the 100m dash. Only problem: Gene was the only person to see it. He tries to convince Finny to do it again with the timekeepers and the coach there, but Finny states he did it because he wanted to. They then go to the beach and camp out. Unfortunately, Gene has missed studying and the instruction for a math test that next morning, and fails. Finny states it's a mere fluke and that Gene will always pull through. He guesses that Gene wants to beat Brinker as top of the class. Gene suddenly begins to suspect that Finny secretly wants him to fail - Finny is a D student.The day comes when they convince Leper to jump from the tree. Finny tries to get Gene to come, but Gene insists he needs to study. Finny doesn't understand, thinking that things come naturally to Gene like they do to him. Gene states that Finny wouldn't understand, and he and Finny leave for the tree. Leper isn't there, and so the two decide to do a side-by-side double jump. Finny steps out first, and in a moment of rage, Gene shakes the tree limb. Finny loses his balance and falls. Suddenly, Gene regrets what he did.Finny will be OK, says Brinker, quoting the doctor. Finny's leg is shattered and sports are done for him. Gene states that's not fair, because it's what Finny lived for. Nobody suspects that Gene was to blame. Gene visits Finny and tries to tell him what really happened, but the doctor interrupts stating that Finny needs rest and that he's being sent home.Three weeks later, the fall session ends, and Gene visits Finny at his house - mansion is more like it. He tries once again to tell Finny what actually happened in the tree, but Finny won't believe it stating he'd ""kill"" Gene if he didn't shut up. Gene leaves shortly after.Leper, Brinker, and Gene go apple picking to help out a local farmer who states that his youngest son came home and he buried him under his favorite tree. He gives Leper his youngest son's army cap. Finny calls long distance and Gene and he talk. Finny states that if he can't do sports, Gene needs to do them for him and take part in the Devon Winter Olympics. Brinker becomes suspicious of the accident and Gene hears him discussing the mystery with the other boys.It begins snowing, and the students are sent to help shovel snow on the railroad tracks. Leper, meanwhile, is touring on skis to find a beaver dam. Brinker then announces to Gene that he's going to enlist for the army, and wonders if Gene will come along too. Gene agrees and Finny arrives back. The day of enlistment comes, but with Finny's return, Gene changes his mind, making Brinker more curious about Gene's character. Finny begins training Gene for the school Olympics, stating that he once had aspirations to be in the real Olympics.The students watch a movie about the Ski Troops in the war, and Leper is the first one to enlist upon seeing. He gives each of his friends a present. For Finny: the snail house. For Gene: a new alarm clock. For Brinker: His deer stalker cap. He then leaves. The students read the headlines on the war and wonder what Leper could be doing. Finny then states his dislike for the war.Shortly after, Gene witnesses a raggedy Leper creeping through the school courtyards. He gives chase and finds Leper living in a small shelter made from sticks and leaves. Leper states he was kicked out of the army and he could never go back. He said he was seeing things and that he needs a friend, but then goes on to state in Gene's face that Gene is incapable of friendship. In rage, Gene hits him and tells him to shut up. Leper knows the truth. Gene then leaves Leper alone.Later on, Gene and Finny return to their dorm to see the snail house destroyed. Whilst cleaning it, Gene discovers letters from people in the army addressed to Finny. Finny announces that he always wanted to go to the army, but his leg prevented him from doing so, and he tried to pretend that the war never existed.We then return to the beginning of the film. Gene and Finny are taken from their room, and we see the figure watching them. It is Leper. Brinker interrogates Gene and Finny about the incident in the tree, but Finny denies Gene ever doing anything, and Gene agrees, but Leper appears and states that he was at the bottom of the tree. They didn't see him. One moved up and the other moved down, like a piston, and Finny fell. Finny declares that it's nonsense and storms out, only to trip on the marble stares and falling, breaking the same leg.He's taken to the infirmary, and Gene tries to see him, but Finny declines him. The next day, Gene visits him and tells him the truth. Finny states that it wasn't Gene, but a dark side of him. No grudge or hate towards him, just madness. They make up, and the doctor states to Gene that he'll be moving and fixing Finny's bone - a cleaner cut this time - and he can come back around five.Gene goes swimming again and thinks about all that Finny had told him. When he returns the doctor announces that the cut was so clean that anybody could have mended it. He says that some bone marrow must have gone straight to Finny's heart, which in turn, killed him. Gene is taken over with guilt.He and Brinker are the only two by the end, and Gene announces that he is going to enlist. Proud of his pluck, Brinker shakes his hand and wishes him luck. Gene packs up and looks at his room. Whilst leaving, he states that Finny taught him how not to be at war with himself and to move on. His last line is: ""And so I will, Fin.""
And the movie ends."
Strong friendship between students slowly turns into bitter rivalry with fatal consequences.::Anonymous
"Commander Charles ""Chuck"" Prescott [Marshall Thompson] is not so sure that his brother,
Lieutenant Dan Prescott [Bill Edwards], is the correct choice for piloting the Y-13 into
outer space. Although Captain Ben Richards [Robert Ayres] of the Air Force Space Command
says that Dan is the best pilot they have, he bucked the rules when flying
Y-12, went into the ionosphere, had problems landing his ship, and then
promptly ran to see his girlfriend, Tia Francesca [Marla Landi], before bothering to
even make out his report. Still, Capt Richards wants Dan to pilot the
Y-13, after he has been throughly checked out and briefed by Doctor Paul
von Essen [Carl Jaffe].Y-13 takes off with Dan at the controls. He climbs and climbs. At
600,000 feet, when he is supposed to level off and begin his descent, he
continues to climb, even firing his emergency boost. He climbs to
1,320,000 feet (250 miles) and suddenly loses control of the ship and
passes through some meteorite dust, so he is forced to catapult.The next that is heard about Y-13 is a report to the New Mexico State
Police that some Mexican farmer saw a parachute attached to some sort of
plane land near his farm on Route 17 about 10 miles south of Alvarado.
Chief Wilson [Bill Nagy] has the presence to notify the military in case it has
something to do with their recent rocket firing. Wilson meets with
Commander Chuck and shows him the wreckage. No way could the pilot have
survived the crash. Tests on the recovered aircraft show that the
automatic escape mechanism as well as the breaking chute operated
perfectly. Tests also reveal some sort of unknown encrustation on the
hull, unusual because not x-rays nor infrared photography nor ultraviolet
will pass through it.Later that night, a wheezing creature breaks into the New Mexico
State Blood Bank in Alameda and drinks up a lot of the blood. The next
day, the headline in the Santa Fe Daily News reads ""Terror Roams State""
and tells of brutal and inhuman slaughtering of cows on a farm right next
door to where the Y-13 fell. Both the cows and the blood bank nurse show
similar wounds -- jagged tears across the throat. When Chuck and Chief
Wilson examine the body of the nurse, Chuck notices some shiny specks
around the wound as well as on the blood bank door. They see the same
specks on the necks of the dead cattle. They also find a piece of what
looks like a ""high-altitude oxygen lead"" lying under the dead cow's body.
The oxygen lead appears to be the one from Y-13.Chuck is beginning to suspect that the killings may have something to
do with the crashed spaceship and requests that Wilson send samples of the
shiny specks to Dr von Essen at Aviation Medicine. The next day, Chuck
stops at Aviation Medicine where Tia, who just happens to work there, has
the test results sent down to them while they break for coffee. The
results show that the shiny specks are particles of meteorite dust ""that
show no signs of structural damage such as would be expected from passage
through atmosphere."" Later, Dr von Essen demonstrates for Chuck the
results of metallurgical tests on the encrustation. Oddly, wherever the
encrustation occurs on the hull of Y-13, the metal is intact, but in
places not encrusted, the metal has transformed into a brittle substance,
like crumbling carbon, that can easily be reduced to a powder. Chuck
theorizes that the encrustation may be some sort of ""cosmic protection"",
like the primeval creatures that crawled out of the sea and grew skin to
protect themselves from the sun.Meanwhile, Capt Richards is paid a visit by Senor Ramon DeGareara [Roger Delgado],
consul for Mexico at Santa Fe. DeGareara tells them that the tail section
of Y-13 fell from the sky into a new bullring in San Pedro. It scared the
bull, which jumped from the ring and almost killed His Excellency, the
Minister for Social Services. After taking care of formalities and
arranging compensation for damages, a crew is sent to San Pedro to salvage
the rest of Y-13.Three more killings are reported, and Chuck is beginning to put the
pieces together. He suspects that the same encrustation that formed to
protect the hull of Y-13 also coated everything inside the cockpit,
including Dan, and that the creature doing the killing is Dan himself,
killing because he needs blood for some reason. Chuck further theorizes
that, when the canopy burst, Dan's blood absorbed a high content of
nitrogen while the protective encrustation quickly formed on his body,
allowing him to survive in the rarified atmosphere of space. In addition,
Dan's metabolism could have altered to a state that starved his body and
brain of oxygen so that he now needs to replace that oxygen by drinking
blood. That's Chuck's guess anyway.When Dan's encrusted helmut is found in a car with his latest victim,
Chuck's theory is proven right. But how are they to go about stopping him,
since bullets cannot penetrate the crust? Capt Richards and Chief Wilson
put in a call to Washington while Chuck and Tia stay behind to chat about
the wisdom of sending a person into space. Suddenly, Tia screams. The
hulking, wheezing, encrusted creature that is now Dan enters the room by
crashing through a sliding window.Chuck realizes by the wheezing that Dan is finding it difficult to
breathe. He instructs Tia to get Dr von Essen to open a high-altitude
chamber and then goes after his brother, who is running, wheezing and
grunting, down the hall. Chuck taps into the P.A. system and warns
everyone in the building to stay out of the corridors. Chuck then
instructs Dr von Essen to get on the P.A. and relay to Dan, who appears to
have intelligence under the encrustation, the directions to the
high-altitude chamber. Dan follows the directions while Chuck follows
behind him.Into the chamber Dan goes, but Chuck realizes that Dan won't be able
to operate the controls with his encrusted fingers, so he hops into the
chamber with Dan. While Dan lumbers around, taking potshots at Chuck, the
chamber technician quickly increases the simulated altitude to 38,000
feet, enabling Dan to feel more comfortable. While Chuck breathes oxygen
through a mask, Dan sits down and tries to describe what happened.
Unfortunately, he has no memory of the events. All he can remember is
darkness, feeling suffocated, and trying to stay alive until he could find
Dr von Essen. As Tia takes metabolism and blood pressure readings on Dan,
he apologizes to Tia for the way things ended. I just had to be the first
man into space, he says, then keels over dead.
`
Capt Richards and Dr von Essen open the door into the high-altitude
chamber and let Chuck out. While they concern themselves with the risks of
space travel (""There will always be men willing to take the risk""), Chuck
walks down the hall with Tia following him. [Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl]"

Ruhi, while she has much professional respect for A.J., she has been wooed and won over by Reggi. Sheena, on the other hand, holds a grudge against Reggi because, while she did a lot for him as a PR, he had rejected her in a personal relationship. As A.J. and Reggi face off against each in a do or die battle, envy and betrayal rear their ugly heads, and talent struggles to survive the onslaught of a carefully orchestrated smear campaign.::Q.

"The story opens in the late 1960s at Parris Island, South Carolina, the U.S. Marine Corps Training Camp, where a group of young Marine recruits, after having their heads shaved, are being prepped for basic training by the brutal Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey), whose orders are to ""weed out all non-hackers"". Hartman gives each of the Marines nicknames; one pragmatic recruit who talks behind his back becomes ""Joker"" (Matthew Modine); a Texas recruit becomes ""Cowboy"" (Arliss Howard). And finally Leonard Lawrence, a 6-foot 3-inch, 280 pound, slow-witted recruit with low intelligence and ambition becomes ""Gomer Pyle"" (Vincent D'Onofrio), and the focus of Hartman's brutality, because the overweight recruit cannot keep up with the other more physically fit recruits in the grueling obstacle courses.Hartman leads the recruits through endless running, marching and rifle drills. When Pyle mixes up right from left, Hartman slaps him viciously and makes him walk behind the platoon with his pants around his ankles while sucking his thumb after he cries from the constant verbal and physically abuse. On the obstacle course, Pyle can't perform pull-ups or climb to the top of one of the higher obstacles, receiving more torrents of verbal abuse from Hartman.One morning during muster, Hartman asks Joker if he believes in the Virgin Mary. Joker responds that he doesn't, angering the Catholic drill instructor. The clearly religious Hartman gives Joker a vicious backhanded slap and orders Joker to change his answer. Joker stubbornly refuses, stating that he believes that Hartman will only ""beat him harder if he reverses himself."" Hartman immediately promotes Joker to squad leader for having the courage to stand up for himself. However, Hartman also gives Joker the difficult job of being Pyle's personal instructor. Off on the sidelines over the next few days, Joker helps Pyle through the obstacle courses, shows him how to operate and clean his rifle and how to make his bed. However, all of Joker's effort is later proven to be a waste.During a routine evening inspection, Hartman, noticing that Pyle's foot locker is unlocked, searches it and finds a jelly doughnut; food is strictly forbidden in the barracks and Pyle is not permitted to eat donuts because he's overweight. Enraged, Hartman decides that from then on instead of punishing Pyle for each transgression, he'll punish all the other recruits in the platoon. A few nights later, the angry recruits attack Pyle with soap bars wrapped in towels while Cowboy gags him and a few others hold him down on his bed with a blanket. At first, Joker is reluctant to attack Pyle, but after Cowboy persuades him, Joker hits Pyle longer and harder than most of the others. In his bunk, Joker covers his ears, ashamed at himself for his actions, while Pyle howls in pain.After the traumatic experience, Pyle slowly begins to go insane but also shapes up and becomes the fastest and best rifleman, especially after Hartman lectures the platoon on how Lee Harvey Oswald and Charles Whitman were both crack riflemen trained in the Marine Corps. Hartman is impressed with Pyle's shooting skill and his marked improvement in training. Later, when Joker sees Pyle talking to his rifle and staring off into space blankly, and not responding to interaction, he realizes that Pyle is losing his mind (""Section 8""), and confides in Cowboy about Pyle's growing mental breakdown. By the end of basic training, Pyle clearly has been completely dehumanized by its rigors.After graduation Hartman assigns each recruit a MOS (Military Occupational Specialty), most of them as 0300 (Infantry). One exception is Joker who is assigned as a 4212 (Basic Military Journalism). On the platoon's last night on Parris Island, Joker draws fire watch (guard patrol), during which he discovers Pyle in the bathroom loading his M-14 rifle with live ammunition. Frightened, Joker attempts to calm the insane Pyle, who begins blankly shouting, executing drill commands and reciting the Rifleman's Creed. The noise awakens Hartman, who angrily confronts Pyle and quietly demands that he drop the rifle. When Pyle refuses and does not respond, Hartman hurls further insults at him. Pyle responds by shooting Hartman dead, and then aims the rifle at Joker. Joker pleads with Pyle, who lowers the rifle and nods, possibly in recognition of Joker as a friend. Pyle sits down on a toilet, places the muzzle of the weapon in his mouth and pulls the trigger, killing himself.One year later, Joker is in Da Nang, reporting on the Vietnam War for the military newspaper Stars and Stripes. He and his partner, combat photographer Rafterman (Kevyn Major Howard), meet a prostitute (Papillon Soo) in the streets and encounter a thief (Nguyen Hue Phong) who steals Rafterman's camera. Walking back to their base, Rafterman remarks how US military forces are there to help the South Vietnamese but they frequently take advantage of them. He also wants to join Joker in the field and get a good story. Joker tells him he won't take him along for fear of Rafterman being killed. They return to their base for a press meeting with their commanding officer, Lt. Lockhart (John Terry), who reviews their latest news offerings and gives some of his corps new assignments and shares new directives about reporting standards. Joker, however, wants to go to the front lines to get a good story. Joker also remarks that there's a lot of talk about the Tet holiday ceasefire and how it may be broken by enemy forces. Lockhart scoffs at the idea, saying that the Vietnamese will simply go about their usual celebration of the holiday.That evening in the barracks, Rafterman talks with the others GIs about wanting to go into combat, as Joker claims he has done. One of the other GIs mocks Joker, saying he knows Joker has never been in combat because he doesn't have the ""thousand-yard stare."" The sound of nearby artillery fire interrupts their argument. The North Vietnamese Army are attacking and attempting to overrun the base in what turns out to be the beginning of the Tet Offensive. Joker's unit returns fire but the base is not attacked as heavily as other locations.The next day, the staff learns about enemy attacks throughout South Vietnam. After Joker cracks wise about Ann-Margaret's impeding (but likely canceled) visit to the GIs, Lockhart sends Joker to Phu Bai, a Marine forward operating-base near the ancient Vietnamese city of Hue, to cover the combat taking place in the area. Rafterman accompanies him, hoping to get some combat experience. During the helicopter ride, Joker and Rafterman encounter an insane door gunner who shoots indiscriminately at unarmed Vietnamese civilians on the ground, boasting about his ability to kill.When they land outside Hue, Joker and Rafterman meet and talk to a lieutenant, Touchdown (Ed O'Ross). He tells Joker, who is looking for his old friend Cowboy, that he's Cowboy's commanding officer. However, before Joker and Rafterman meet the squad, they follow up a rumor about Vietnamese civilians who are reported to have been executed by the Viet Cong. They go to the mass grave and find over 20 bodies in a mass grave that have been covered with lime. Joker talks to a lieutenant who confirms that the deceased were told by the Viet Cong they'd be ""re-educated"" at a public meeting and were massacred when they arrived. As they wrap up their coverage, Joker is approached and lectured by a belligerent colonel (Bruce Boa) who demands to know why Joker wears a peace symbol on his body armor when he also has the words 'Born to Kill' written on his helmet. Joker suggests it has to do with the ""duality of Man"" according to Jung. The cynical colonel doesn't believe him and tells him to ""get with the program"".They later meet Cowboy's unit, the Lusthog Squad, and Joker is finally reunited with Cowboy, who has been promoted to sergeant and is second-in-command. Joker accompanies the squad during the Battle of Hue. As they approach Hue under tank cover, several mortar rounds land in front of them, killing Lt Touchdown. Another Marine nicknamed Crazy Earl (Kieron Jecchinis) takes command of the squad. The group goes into battle and quickly comes under enemy fire from a nearby building. Afterward, the squad is interviewed by a touring combat news team, and they share their experiences and opinion of the war. A little while later a South Vietnamese Army soldier and pimp (Tan Hung Francione) with a prostitute (Leanne Hong) visit the resting Marines to offer her services to them.A few days later, the squad goes out on patrol again, this time in the factory-ruins north of the Perfume River which divides the city of Hue, where the Americans believe enemy forces have hidden themselves. Crazy Earl comes across a toy rabbit in a ruined building and picks it up, triggering an explosive booby trap that kills him, leaving Cowboy as the reluctant squad leader. The squad becomes lost in more ruined buildings, and a unseen sniper (Ngoc Le) pins them down wounding two of their comrades, first Eightball (Dorian Harewood), and then Doc Jay (Jon Stafford) when he tries to drag Eightball to safety. The sniper refrains from killing the wounded men, with the apparent intention to draw more of the squad into range. Cowboy, unable to get tank support for the squad, orders everyone to pull out and leave Eightball and Doc behind. The M-60 machine gunner, Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin) disregards Cowboy's orders to withdraw, charges into the clump of warehouse buildings, and locates the sniper. As the squad maneuvers to try to locate the sniper's position, Cowboy is shot through a hole in one of the buildings. He is rushed behind one of the blown-out buildings where the squad tries to keep him alive; they fail and Cowboy dies in Joker's arms.Animal Mother assumes command of the remaining Marines and angrily declares, ""Let's go get some payback."" Using smoke grenades to conceal their advance, the squad enters the building and searches for the sniper. Joker finds the sniper on an upper floor, but his rifle jams as he tries to shoot. The enemy sniper, a teenage girl, spins around, opening fire with her automatic rifle, pinning him behind a column. Panicked, Joker drops his rifle and draws his sidearm, however he is unable to shoot back. Rafterman arrives and shoots the sniper, saving Joker. As Animal Mother and other Marines of the squad converge, she begins to pray in her native language, then repeatedly begs (in English) ""shoot me"", prompting an argument about whether to leave her to die from her wounds or to put her out of her misery. Animal Mother decides to allow a mercy killing only if Joker performs it. After some hesitation, Joker shoots her with his sidearm. The Marines sarcastically congratulate him on his first kill as Joker stares into the distance, having finally gotten his dehumanized ""thousand yard stare"".The film concludes with a night time shot of Joker, Rafterman, Animal Mother, and all the rest of the platoon marching through the burning ruins of Hue toward their bivouac for the night, singing the 'Mickey Mouse March'. Joker states that despite being ""in a world of shit"", he is glad to be alive, and is no longer afraid."

Full Metal Jacket begins by following the trials and tribulations of a platoon of fresh Marine Corps recruits focusing on the relationship between Gunnery Sergeant Hartman and Privates Pyle and Joker. We see Pyle grow into an instrument of death as Hartman has foreseen of all of his recruits. Through Pyle's torment and Joker's unwillingness to stand up against it the climax of part one is achieved with all three main characters deciding their fates by their action or inaction. The second chapter delves into Joker's psyche and the repeated referral to the fact that he joined the Corps to become a killer. When his mostly behind the scenes job as a combat correspondent is interfered with by the Tet offensive he is thrust into real combat and ultimately must decide if he really is a killer.::FMJ_Joker

"This probing and multi-layered investigation of love, sex, and commitment plays off China Blue's, Bobby's, and The Reverend's situations against each other. This probing and multi-layered investigation of love, sex, and commitment plays off China Blue's, Bobby's, and The Reverend's situations against each other. Each's sexual frustrations are extrapolated to the larger and symbolic factors of American life. China Blue is the woman in search of sexual fulfillment that includes love, but in her disappointment, she becomes a prostitute by night, career woman by day. Bobby's marriage has mutated into sexual frustration that is also shown as lack of honesty while husband and wife struggle with commitment gone sour. The Reverend is partly a symbolic representation of Christian confusion about sex and love and partly a representation of China Blue's confused and disappointed search for an authentic man/woman relationship. The story is not that simple, however, as it contains searing inditements of Christian salvation methods, the mixture of frustrated sexual longings and Christian condemnation of sex, and society's confusion about sex, marriage, and authentic loving relationships. As the prostitute, China Blue, that character is complex in her dual life, her unlikely opening of herself to a client (Bobby), and her brutal accessments of human sexual nature while leaving open the hope of ""true love."" The story will not resolve into these simplifying statements, however, because all the relationships are multi-dimensional.
For example, the hard bitten China Blue is tender and understanding in the strong scene where she is hired to give a dying man a last sexual thrill. That scene rises way above this description because of honesty of the ill man's pain and of China Blue's sensitivity to that pain. In another scene, China Blue is picked up in a limo by a ""Wall Street"" couple who dally with her while discussing a business deal, equating the couple's removal from real feelings and substituting money games. Her encounters with several male clients explore sexual domination and submission, especially with one (censored*) scene which graphically shows the brutality of a policeman-customer with Blue, but it must be taken as a larger contextual condemnation of violent sex as rape. Bobby appears a typical American male, frustrated in his marriage, longing for honesty, and trying hard to emerge from his teenage ideas into maturity. The price of divorce paid by the children is also referenced in a brief scene; thus, Bobby's divorce is with a large price, and he admits that and other dimensions. The story does not allow any easy or pat answers.
The Reverend is the most difficult character because he appears to harbor genuine caring for China Blue, but has his own twisted sexuality and confused idea of applying his Christianity to contemporary sexual mores. That he is made into a mad man, wanting to kill China Blue with a sharpened dildo, may push the story into horror elements that jar with the rest of the depictions. The final scene where he is killed by China Blue has to be taken symbolically (what will happen when the real police arrive?) in its brutality and unreality, although it does allow China Blue to throw over her ""China Blue"" life symbolically and be able to bond with Bobby.
Overall, the story is a search for authentic feelings and relationships in a world significantly corrupted by lack of trust and confused Christianity and inauthentic sexuality.I wrote more but the web site lost the rest."

Shortly after the Columbine High School massacre, Union Intermediate High School (in Tulsa, Oklahoma) was one of many schools around the country increasing security measures to prevent school shootings. Brandi Blackbear wrote horror stories similar to those of Stephen King, dressed in a slightly Gothlike way, and was not afraid to be herself, or to stand up to bullying by popular kids. Her defiance engendered hostility toward her from certain segments of her school's culture. False stories of threats of violence were circulated, and the combination of her writing and authorities' natural hyperawareness following Columbine led to her being suspended. When some of her fellow students later saw her checking out a book on world religions, including Wicca (as research for her stories), they immediately branded her a witch, and eventually accused her of casting a spell that made a teacher sick. Fear of her spread through much of the school, and she was once again suspended.Finally, her parents went to the ACLU, where they were told they had a good case against the school for violating her civil rights. The ACLU sued the affluent school for $10 million, even though the Blackbears were not sure they deserved that much based on what Brandi had suffered. Still, the ACLU argued that the school would not take any lesser claim seriously. When the school offered a settlement, the Blackbears refused. They were not interested in the money, despite needing it; what they really wanted was to have their story heard in court to inform the public that the school had mistreated Brandi. The judge ruled to dismiss the charges rather than going to trial, and ordered the Blackbears to pay $6000 in court fees, which they could not afford. Eventually it was agreed to drop the fees if the Blackbears dropped their appeal.

"In a small New England town, four elderly men form what they call the ""Chowder Society,"" regaling themselves with the telling of scary ""ghost stories."" Membership in the club, in fact, requires that one present such a story. The four old friends consist of Ricky Hawthorne (Fred Astaire), a lawyer, and his partner Sears James (John Houseman), along with Dr. John Jaffrey (Melvyn Douglas) and Edward Charles Wanderley (Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.), a successful businessman.When Edward's son, David, living in New York, falls from a window after the girl he's sleeping with turns suddenly into a hideous demon, Edward grieves. His other son, Don (Craig Wasson), a college professor who's fallen on hard times, shows up in town, not getting a great reception from Edward, who always preferred the other, more ambitious son.But now the four elderly gentlemen are unsettled, experiencing nightmares. Clearly, something is bothering them. Edward becomes so distraught, he wanders across a bridge in the snow. When he sees the same female apparition that caused his son to fall to his death, Edward, too, falls to his death from the bridge. Although his death is ruled a suicide, his son Don and Edward's three remaining elderly friends doubt it. Don approaches the remaining three friends, requesting membership in their group, offering up a bizarre ""ghost"" story of his own.Don's flashback:A few years earlier, then a promising junior professor in Miami, Florida, Don meets Alma (Alice Krige), a beautiful if mysterious secretary who comes to work at the university. They immediately become involved in a torrid sexual affair, which interferes with Don's job, causing him to miss work and earn the scorn of the Dean who previously championed him.But Don finds something strange about this strange, exotic woman -- a coldness, and he drops her. Later, he hears from his brother David that he has met the same girl in New York and intends to marry her. Don warns his brother that she's trouble, but to no avail. And indeed, Don suspects she caused his death - the fall from the building as seen earlier.Back in the present, the elderly friends react to Don's story. Sears dismisses it, but Ricky believes him. Elderly Dr. John Lafferty, after having a nightmare about the same woman - Alma - dies of a heart attack. This leaves only Sears and Ricky. Thus, they finally tell Don their own strange history with a woman who looked exactly like Alma.Their flashback:Back when the four friends were young in 1931, the beautiful Eva Galli (also Alice Krige) came to town, and, indeed, it's obvious that she's the same person as Alma in the present. The four friends are smitten with Eva, who encourages their sexual interest.It was Young Edward (Don's father) who first took her to bed, but he was impotent with her. When she mocked him later in front of his friends, Young Edward leaps to silence her, knocking her down, accidentally killing her when her head smashes into the stone fireplace. Horrified, the young men realize that she's dead. They consider calling police, but realize it would only mean wrecking their lives. Instead, they load her body into her car, then push it into the nearby lake. As the car descends, Eva stirs inside, looking out at them from the back window.... still alive!Back in the present, Ricky and Sears admit that the death has haunted them all these years. Whereas Sears is dubious, both Ricky and Don believe that Alma and Eva are one in the same and that her ghost has returned to seek revenge after 50 years.Don suggests they go to Eva's old house, now in ruins, to confront the past and her ghost once and for all. They go there, but Don falls on the rotting stairs and breaks his leg. Sears goes off in his car through the snow for help, leaving Don and Ricky behind, but one of Alma/Eva's evil accomplices, an evil boy, causes his car to crash off the icy road and he dies.Ricky nearly dies at the hands of one of Alma's the accomplices, an arrogant young Hod, but Ricky manages to get to the authorities, telling them to pull Eva's car up from the lake to reveal her body inside. This is intercut with Don, who confronts the rotting specter of Alma/Eva's ghost. Ricky and the authorities drag out the ancient car, opening the rusted, corroded door, finding the still-living rotting corpse inside. It falls out, disintegrating before their eyes. Don is spared from the monstrosity of her vengeful ghost, and the town is restored to peace.

"Mary (Mischa Barton) is a 14-year-old freshman new student at an all-girls boarding school located somewhere in rural Ontario and she is assigned a dorm room with Paulie (Piper Perabo) and Victoria, nicknamed Tori, (Jessica Paré), two seniors. Paulie is an American and Victoria is a Canadian local. On Mary's first day at the school, Pauline turns a quiet afternoon on the campus into a music-blasting dance party and spikes the punch with hard liquor.In an effort to get the shy Mary to break out of her shell, Paulie and Tori involve her in their activities, such as running in the morning. When they hear that Mary's mother has recently died, Paulie nicknames her ""Mary Brave.""Another day later, Pauline defends Victoria from a frustrated math teacher who humiliates her when she does not understand basic math.Mary observes the intimacy between her two roommates. Peering out a window at night, she sees the two of them kissing on a roof. Paulie and Tori's relationship is close and Paulie is full of life. Over time, Paulie and Tori become more comfortable showing affection in front of Mary. It progresses from a quick kiss on the lips in front of her to the two sharing a bed and having lesbian sex while Mary is sleeping.When the three are out jogging one day, Paulie comes across a hurt falcon, which she befriends. After reading up on falcons, she trains the animal while keeping it in a makeshift birdhouse on the roof of their dorm building. While she is tending to the falcon, Mary and Tori meet some boys from the nearby boys school. One of them, named Jake, flirts with Tori, asking if she will be attending her brother's 18th birthday party and making it clear that he likes her. When Mary and Tori are alone, Tori expresses disgust at the boy's interest in her, saying, ""He liked my tits."" When Mary asks if she'll go to the party, Tori says, ""And have all those gross guys groping me? No, thanks. I'd rather stay home and do math.""Meanwhile, on the sides, Mary spends time with the local groundskeeper Joe Menzies (Graham Greene) whom she volunteers to help him work with landscaping around the campus. Mary confides in Joe about her troubled home life and her lack of parental attention by her father whom has began neglecting her following her mother's death and focus his attention to her stepmother whom treats Mary badly. Joe encourages Mary to live out her frustration and unhappiness through work.One morning, Victoria's sister, Allison (Emily VanCamp), another freshman student, and her friends rush into the room to wake up the older girls. Paulie is lying in Tori's bed, both clearly topless. Horrified silence falls over everyone. Mary pushes Tori's sister out of the room and closes the door. Tori angrily tells Paulie to get out of her bed. Paulie tries to downplay the situation, and Tori tells her she doesn't understand, explaining that her sister will tell her parents about it.When confronted by Allison, Tori tries to extinguish her sister's suspicions by telling her that Paulie has an unrequited crush on her and crawled into her bed. Her sister promises to ""fix"" the rumors about Tori and not tell their parents anything. As she walks away from this conversation, Victoria collapses into tears.In the school library, Victoria explains to Mary that her conservative family, her parents and her sister, are strongly opposed to homosexuality, and she must stop the relationship with Paulie to prevent their rejection. Mary sympathizes with both of her friends, as she too feels rejected by her father, who does not bother to show up to a father/daughter dance. In the forest at night, Tori and Jake have sex against a tree. Both Mary and Paulie accidentally witness this scene and run back to their room before Tori returns.When Tori returns to the room, Paulie asks her where she's been and Tori says she was with a friend. Paulie lashes out at her by telling her that she saw what Tori and Jake were doing in the woods. In a very poignant moment, Tori tells Paulie that the intimacy that they had shared will never happen again but she (Tori) would always love her, both as a friend and as a lover.At this point onward, Paulie rapidly degenerates into psychotic behavior over Tori's withdrawal from their relationship. She smashes a mirror and hurls a dish cart to the ground and begins to act out in belligerent ways in class and out of it. A rejection letter from the agency that handled Paulie's adoption, which informs her that her birth mother denied a request from Paulie to get in touch, further sends her over the edge.When Paulie is called into the headmistress Fay Vaughn (Jackie Burroughs) office over mouthing off one too many times to a teacher, Paulie refuses to talk to Headmistress Vaughn about her recent behavior or what is bothering her. The headmistress suggests that Paulie is going through a nervous breakdown, but Paulie says that it's not the reason and storms out of the office. Later, when Headmistress Vaughn confronts Paulie on the school's quad, Paulie finally confides in her about her romance with a female student who ended it out of shame (without naming Tori's name). The headmistress is surprisingly very sympathetic with Paulie. She tells Paulie that when she was younger, she suffered a nervous breakdown too when her ""girlfriend"" abandoned her in a similar situation, but the headmistress got over it and offers emotional support for Paulie. But Paulie refuses to talk anymore and walks off.Meanwhile, Victoria, clearly ashamed at her lesbianism, creates an fabricated image of her heterosexuality to her friends and her sister by dating Jake Hollander (Luke Kirby) from a nearby all boys' school and avoiding Paulie.One day in the woods, Paulie declares a fencing duel to the death with Jake. Jake is not taking her seriously until he ends up on the ground after being slashed, with Paulie brandishing a sword above him. She demands that he give up Tori. When he refuses, she stabs him in the leg. Mary rushes to stop her and Paulie runs off.Mary runs to Victoria's soccer match, where the headmistress, math teacher and fellow students are congregated. Upon reaching the group, Mary sees Paulie, sobbing from the top of a nearby building while holding her falcon. Whispering: ""I rush into the secret house,"" (a reference to Shakespeare on suicide) Paulie jumps to her death, and as she falls, the injured falcon flies out of the doomed Paulie's hands into the air. The final shot shows the recovered falcon flying away into the bright blue sky background."

"Palmares was a 17th-century quilombo, a settlement of escaped slaves in the mountains of northeast Brazil. The story follows a group of plantation slaves, among them Abiola (Tony Tornado), who revolt in 1650 during the Dutch-Portuguese War (1601-1661) and escape to the mountains and the city of Palmares, where they join other former slaves who have already been living there peacefully and autonomously. On arrival, Abiola suggests that Palmares trade with a friendly squatter. The leader of Palmares, Acotirene (Alaide Santos), disagrees, but realizes that she is getting old and times are changing. After consulting a divination tray, she anoints Abiola the new leader and renames him Ganga Zumba and places him under the protection of Xango, who manifests himself though Ganga Zumba in trance. Ganga Zumba goes on to become a legendary king (see Diegues' film ""Ganga"" about the life of this character in particular). Ganga Zumba and his people keep Palmares safe for years.The film introduces other important characters, among them Zumbi (Antonio Pompeu), who was born free in Palmares but was captured as a child and lived as a slave for fifteen years, and Ana de Ferro (Vera Fischer), a white woman who choses to live in Palmares because she had been branded a Dutch collaborator as she had been a prostitute in Dutch-controlled Recife. Zumbi becomes chief warrior of Palmares and leads successful raids but refuses to take Recife, since to hold it would require enslaving the white population. Ana rises to become an advisor to Ganga Zumba. When the Dutch-Portuguese War ends, Ganga Zumba is persuaded by the Portuguese to leave the mountains to live on a reservation in the Cocaú Valley in exchange for peace. Many of the villages and towns of Palmares disagree with this change and choose to remain in the mountains. In the Cocaú Valley, Ganga Zumba is poisoned and killed.The warrior Zumbi emerges as the leader of a new generation at Palmares. Zumbi, unlike Ganga Zumba, demands freedom and independence and refuses to compromise with the Portuguese. Intermittent warfare exists until 1694, when the Portuguese send a decisive force under Domingos Jorge Velho (Maurício do Valle) against Palmares. The quilombo is once again attacked and this time taken by the Portuguese, with most of its inhabitants brutally murdered or enslaved (though the film manages to represent these events without victimizing the people). Although, the movie ends on a low point depicting the death of Zumbi and the destruction of the principal settlement of Palmares, a title card at the end explains that the people of Palmares continued to resist the Portuguese until at least 1797. The film insists that Palmares must continue to live on through memory and by keeping alive the traditions of its people."

While living in the house he is befriended by both a P.R. 'handler', Margaret, and the single mom next door, Sarah, who may or may not be interested in him romantically. Over the course of his house arrest, Gary becomes convinced that he is being haunted by the number nine, including finding a note saying ""Look for the nines"" in his handwriting.

During the process of post production, a television executive, Susan, pushes for Gavin to ditch his friend Melissa as the unconventional lead actress of his project, in favor of a more attractive, well-known accress. This causes an argument between him and Melissa, which leads to his telling the reality TV cameraman to leave him alone.

"Three peripherally related stories are presented. Beyond taking place in the same semi-fictional universe, the stories are connected by a stock company of actors portraying different characters in each of the three stories, those characters who are meant to look like each other from one story to the next. In ""Part One: The Prisoner"", Gary, a successful Hollywood television actor, has just been placed under house arrest, his sentence, out of circumstance, to be served in a house connected to his publicist, Lola, instead of his own house. While acerbic-tongued Margaret, one of Lola's representatives, works on keeping Gary's good name within the public fan-base in tact under the circumstances, Gary, lonely and alone at the house, makes a connection with Sarah, a married mother who lives next door. Sarah entering Gary's life is not by accident. In ""Part Two: Reality Television"", screenwriter Gavin Taylor has just had his television project green-lighted by the network. Concurrently, he has agreed to star in another just green-lighted project, a reality television series based on the making of his show. Gary wrote the show with his good friend Melissa McCarthy in mind to star, she who quit a lucrative gig on Gilmore Girls (2000) to accommodate Gary. But Gary ultimately has to answer to the network - Susan Howard who is acting on behalf of the network - while Susan and the network kowtow to their advertisers. All the players in question may have different and conflicting priorities. In ""Chapter Three: Knowing"", married Gabriel and Mary, a video game designer and editor respectively, and their eight year old daughter Noelle return to their car from a secluded wilderness hike to find it has a dead battery. While Mary and Noelle wait at the car, Gabriel goes for help. The first person he encounters is Sierra, who is out for a hike herself. Sierra ultimately but somewhat reluctantly decides to help Gabriel to the best of her ability, which hides her true motive.

The 1978 kidnapping of politician Aldo Moro as seen from the perspective of one of his assailants: a conflicted young woman in the ranks of the Red Brigade.::Anonymous
"The movie is based on a true story. On 16 March 1978 Aldo Moro, the former Italian Prime Minister was kidnapped in Via Fani by the Brigate Rosse (Red Brigades), a militant Communist Italian group. He was the main supporter of the Compromesso Storico (Hystorical Compromise), which had to lead to the first Italian government supported by both the Christian Democrats and the Communists, in a period of social, economic and political crises. During the attack his five escort agents were all killed. Moro's corpse was found on 9 May 1978 in a car parked in a street between the headquarters of the Christian Democrat Party and the Communist Party. This movie is inspired by this tragic event which traumatize the whole nation. It focuses mainly on the relationship between the prisoner and his guards through the eyes of Chiara, the young woman whose role is to guard the prisoner. The movie portraits Chiara's life (her job as a librarian, the ordinary household) on one side and the political process which is held against Moro by her friends on the other, while they are waiting for a revolution to come. She is drawn between these two aspects and she begins to doubt her political commitment (she cries when she listens to Moro's letter to the Pope). The news tell the people what is going on in Italy (some politicians ask for the death penalty for the kidnappers, the Pope Paul VI appeals to the terrorist for Moro's release). The State will not bend by accepting the conditions established by the terrorists to release the prisoner. The Brigate Rosse sentence Moro to death and the story comes to its tragic end, although the eyes and the heart of the imagination show Aldo Moro walking happy and free in Rome.::manutwo"

While Mr. March serves in the Union Army, Mrs. March, affectionately referred to as ""Marmee"" by her daughters, holds the family together and teaches the girls the importance of giving to those less fortunate than themselves, especially during the upcoming Christmas season.Though the spoiled and vain Amy often bemoans the family's lack of material wealth and social status, Jo, an aspiring writer, keeps everyone entertained with her stories and plays, while the youngest March, the shy and sensitive Beth, accompanies Jo's productions on an out-of-tune piano. The spirited Jo, a tomboy in search of male companionship, strikes up a friendship with Theodore ""Laurie"" Laurence, the grandson of the March's wealthy, but cantankerous neighbor, James Laurence.Later that winter, Jo so impresses Mr. Laurence with her forthrightness and her beneficial effect on the brooding Laurie, that he invites the March sisters to a fancy dress ball at his sumptuous home. At the ball, Meg is courted by John Brooke, Laurie's tutor, and Jo consents to dance with Laurie while Amy and Beth breathlessly view the scene from their perch atop the staircase. Mr. Laurence's gruff demeanor is softened upon meeting Beth, who reminds him of the beloved granddaughter he lost, and when he learns of her musical talent, he offers her the use of his grand piano. The beautiful evening ends on a sour note, however, when Amy and Beth overhear the snobbish Mrs. Gardiner and her daughter gossiping about Marmee.As the weeks pass, Laurie's affection for Jo grows, but Jo rebuffs him as a suitor, claiming that although she loves him as a friend, she will never marry. Meanwhile, Jo attempts to discourage Meg's deepening feelings for Mr. Brooke, fearing that a marriage will break the bond between the sisters.Spring arrives, and Marmee receives word that Mr. March has been wounded and sent to an Army hospital in Washington, D.C.

"A film crew is stranded in a melancholy seaside hotel somewhere outside of Lisbon when the production runs out of money mid-shoot. The director, Friedrich, is a gentle philosophical leader of intellect and heart who enjoys a paternal relationship with everyone in the cast and crew. He is a rock of calm in the midst of this crisis, keeping his charges fed and sheltered not only physically, but emotionally. He accomplishes this through maintaining the company's focus on their art and humanity during the boring days they spend waiting for an infusion of cash to resume work.His steadfast ally in this is the grizzled old cameraman Joe, whose vast experience in the business steadies him as a father can a son. As days stretch out with no word from their producer back in the USA, the people occupy themselves in the minutiae of forestalling the crushing boredom. They are becoming a family of sorts, forced to empathize and interact with each other more intimately than film crews normally do. It is the silver lining in this cloud of doubt enveloping them.But as days become weeks, foreboding begins to overtake them. Joe must return home to bury his terminally-ill wife, reluctantly leaving Friedrich to manage the worsening situation alone. Dennis, the high-strung line producer/writer, begins to snap, despairing in what he calls the ""suicide"" of making films. When Friedrich attempts to assuage Dennis' panic, pleading, ""We're in the same boat"", he replies, ""No, YOU'RE in the boat --- I'm on the ship."" Dennis, like many paranoids, is privy to knowledge others miss. He knows many important facts that he's withholding from Friedrich: like the elaborate data base he's assembled which tabulates and illustrates every aspect of their project from storyboards and budget to biographies of all players ... and most important, the fact that their producer has deserted them and there will be no more money. Friedrich can sense the unspoken betrayal though he cannot believe it. He realizes with alarm that drastic measures are necessary.He desperately flies to Hollywood to talk to his producer and old friend Gordon if only to obtain a reason for his abandonment. Now the interminably sluggish pace of Portugal is accelerated to the frenetic pace of L.A. He soon discovers after a convoluted search that Gordon isn't just hiding from him, but everybody. And there is something very spooky going on: he's being shadowed as he tries to find Gordon. He eventually locates Gordon hunkered down in a borrowed mobile home parked beside LA's last drive-in burger joint on a seedy part of the Sunset Strip. They greet each other warmly and immediately renew their familiar camaraderie.
In the RV, Gordon finally reveals to his friend what has happened. He loved the dailies he saw coming from Portugal. He proudly showed the rushes to the investors, who didn't understand what was wrong with the picture, wanting to know what had happened to the color. When Gordon explained to them that it was shot in black-and-white, they were very disappointed. Unfortunately, these investors' displeasure is keener than normal: they're the Mob. They put out a contract on Gordon. As their night of sad/comic ruminations on the nature of art, stories, Hollywood and reality turns to dawn, the friends step outside the RV for a last hug as Gordon prepares to go back underground and Friedrich back to Portugal to somehow reconcile his crew to the state of things. Then the hit goes down, efficiently, anonymously and finally."

"Harry Lee returns home to Malaysia from overseas studies. He has failed everything and is kicked out of home by his father, a disgrace. He forms a dance band with Yati, his childhood friend. Harry is Chinese by race and does not believe in god. Yati is a modern Malay and Muslim who believes in her heritage and religion. The five members of this band (Malay, Chinese, Indian and Eurasian) represent the multi-racial nature of Malaysian society, and English is their common language. The band members are forced to flee Kuala Lumpur, the capital city, when the loan sharks demand repayment of a debt. They flee to the picturesque East Coast, where traditions and myths still hold strong amongst the villagers and fishermen. They are in familiar yet disturbing territory, and their hip and modern dance music blends with the magical folk songs of an old culture. Away from the pressures of urban life, Yati and Harry's childhood crush develops into something much stronger, a love that crosses racial and religious boundaries. Harry and Yati are forced to resolve personal issues of love and betrayal, race and religion.::Teck Tan <niche@ppp.nasionet.net>"
"Comments by Actor / Writer Roy C. PetersonThis is a skier's movie. I only wish there were more ski movies. I've seen this one many times and enjoy it every time. Robert Redford did all his own skiing for this and must be especially fond and proud of this particular film.The character Redford plays, David Chappellet, is a very bleak and grimly determined individual (Remember Bruno in The Blue Max?) When David goes home to visit his father we see where he got his emotional approach to living. Their conversations are so minimalist as to be nearly autistic. From their viewpoint probably just seen as practical minded and verbally economical. But I don't care what anybody says. There was something I liked about this character and found myself rooting for him. I was happy when he won at the end. What else would there have been to this story if he hadn't won? To love your work and to never betray it, whatever else happens, is one of the greatest gifts that life can give."
"Quietly cocky Robert Redford joins U.S. ski team as downhill racer and clashes with the team's coach, played by Gene Hackman. Lots of good skiing action leading to an exciting climax.::Rick Morton <RNMorton@aol.com>"
"David Chappellet is a mean-spirited skier, who profits from another skier's injury to gain a spot on the American Olympic team. His roommate sums up his goals when he observes of David, ""He's not for the team, and he never will be""; but precisely who the David is that David is so fiendishly striving for we're never to learn. He develops a short-lived relationship with Carole Stahl, a glamorous European woman even more capricious than himself. Chappellet's identity trouble are exacerbated by the fact that he is an ""Event"" as well as a personality; and more astute minds than his own have difficulty where the one leaves off and the other takes over. Director Michael Richie's (""The Candidate"") feature film debut.::alfiehitchie"
