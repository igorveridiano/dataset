Killearn tells him that he'd given MacDonald the money and he left. Killearn also suggests that MacDonald had stolen the money for himself and may have boarded a ship to America. MacDonald had earlier told Rob he wished to leave Scotland for Virginia. Rob refuses to believe that MacDonald would betray him and decides to take his case directly to Montrose. When he meets with the lord he tries to strike a new deal for more money. Montrose will agree provided Rob falsely testifies that Campbell is a Jacobite. Rob refuses only knowing Campbell by reputation. When he suggests that Montrose is crooked Montrose orders Archie to arrest Rob.

They fire a warning shot at him and bleat like sheep as they sail back across the lake. Mary furiously washes her groin in the lake and Alasdair realizes that she's been raped.

Spurned by Archie Betty agrees to testify that she overheard Archie and Killearn conspiring to steal the money given to MacDonald.

Enraged Mary stabs him in the neck bringing Rob and Alasdair. Rob tries to calm Mary down leaving Killearn to Alasdair. Alasdair drowns Killearn in the lake.

He tells Archie that he a thief and rapist and Archie tells him that Campbell's wife Mary was more enjoyable when raped than others who were willing and that ""not all of her objected."" Rob lunges forward and bites at Archie ripping his coat. Archie beats him and has him gagged for the rest of the march home.When they reach the Bridge at Glen Orchy Montrose is waiting. Rob is allowed to speak in his defense. He claims that Archie killed MacDonald and stole the money. Archie denies the charges and Montrose orders his men to hang Rob from the bridge. Rob quickly grabs the rope binding his hands loops it around Archie's neck and jumps from the bridge. The rope pulls Archie to the edge where one of the soldiers uses a sword to cut it freeing Rob who plunges into the stream below - Archie is still alive.

On the bank he finds the rotting carcass of a dead ox and quickly guts it using the animal to hide from the search party who won't approach because of the stench.Rob rejoins Mary at a safe house. which Mary had earlier negotiated from Campbell himself and secured the property under his protection. Rob confronts Mary about the rape but realizes she still loves him and that the child she bears is definitely his.

Campbell and Montrose agree on a wager. After laying out the customary rules about backstabbing and quarter ""no quarter being given or asked."" The two duel and Archie has obviously superior skills to Rob Roy. He toys with Rob slashing him superficially several times on his torso and then on his dueling arm disarming him.He lifts Rob's chin with his blade and receives a nod from the moderator to end the duel and Rob Roy's life. Rob suddenly grasps Archie's sword blade at his own neck with his bare hand. He picks up his own sword from the floor next to him and Archie is too surprised for a moment at Rob's sudden action to do anything. Rob swiftly cuts Archie deeply from his shoulder to his sternum opening a wide wound. Archie is shocked gasps blood spilling from his mouth stumbles and falls dead.Rob settles his wagers with Campbell and Montrose and leaves. Montrose tells Archie's sponsor that he will hold him to their wager meaning that all of Rob Roy's debts are wiped clean. Rob returns home to Mary who is overjoyed to see him."

In 19th century India three British soldiers and a native waterbearer must stop a secret mass revival of the murderous Thuggee cult before it can rampage across the land.::Kenneth Chisholm
"Based loosely on the poem by Rudyard Kipling this takes place in British India during the Thuggee uprising. Three fun loving sergeants are doing fine until one of them wants to get married and leave the service. The other two trick him into a final mission where they end up confronting the entire cult by themselves as the British Army is entering a trap. This is of the ""War is fun"" school of movie making. It has the flavour of watching Notre Dame play an inferior high school team.::John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net>"
Born in British India Gunga Din always wanted to join the British army like many of his fellow Indians but was not allowed to do so. So he starts observing them and learns accordingly. He befriends Sgt. Archibald Cutter and warns him about a Thuggee uprising that may threaten their base. Sgt. Cutter and others are able to fend off the attack but when Gunga gets information of a much larger rebel attack Cutter accompanies him to the cult's temple embedded with gold statues of Hindu deities. Gunga finds out he is regarded as a traitor by his countrymen and Cutter as well as Sergeants MacChesney and Ballantine are held captive by the Thuggees in a bid to force the British to leave India.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)
"A young girl of about 10 years lives in a solitary peasant's house on the edge of the jurassic mountains in the East of France. One day in autumn when she is on her way to school through the forest she observes a hunting fox. Of course the fox flees from her but the girl feels a strong desire to meet the fox again.During the following months she spends most of her free time in the forests exploring the nature observing many different animals but above all searching for the fox. Yet she never sees the fox again before winter comes. During the winter already knowing how to distinguish the tracks various animals leave in the snow she follows fox's traces far across the fields through woods and thickets. Still she does not find the fox but instead she is terrified by the howling of wolves close by. In panic she tries to run home but seriously hurts her ankle during her flight.The film does not explain how she manages to get back home at all; maybe she manages to walk despite her injury maybe her parents miss her search for her and carry her back. In any case the healing of her injured leg takes all the rest of the winter. She cannot leave the house any more but spends lots of time reading books about the wild animals of the woods above all about foxes.During springtime the girl resumes her roaming in the woods. She already knows how to identify fox's kennels. Finding many of them she finds some empty some blocked by people who consider foxes harmful animals that should be hunted down and killed. But she also finds a kennel that's obviously inhabited. Sitting down behind the bushes some dozens of meters away from the kennel she patiently waits for the fox to come out or to come home. But the fox having cast its young is particularly shy and wary not showing itself when the girl is near. In fact it is so disquieted that it starts removing its young to a different hole in order to hide them from the spying human. By chance just when the fox carries one of its young out of the kennel the girl returns and sees it leaving.The girl understands that the fox is extremely frightened so she decides not to try to find the new hiding. On the other hand she guesses that the new hole must be close so she watches the scene from a larger distance: From the branches of an old beech near the edge of the forest. And indeed after many fruitless and uneventful watches the fox finally shows itself.During the following weeks the girl is gradually taming the fox: At first the intervals at which the girl sees the fox decrease but the fox is always staying far away from the girl and flees as soon as they become aware of each other. When the girl starts to put pieces of bacon in a line leading to her tree the fox starts coming closer. After many weeks the fox still flees from the girl but allows her to follow at a distance: They start roaming the fields and woods together in this peculiar manner. The girl from her perspective gets the impression that the fox is showing her around the forest - in any case she comes to know many new places and things in the forest that she wasn't aware of before.Again many weeks pass before the fox starts taking meat from the girl's hand and still longer before it allows her to touch it but finally the fox enjoys being fondled like a dog. It even leads the girl to its kennel where she meets the young foxes too.During the summer while following the fox the girl lives through many adventures: jumping across a mountain creek in a deep and narrow ravine nearly getting lost in a karst cave passing a night in the forest utterly scared by the sounds of the night in the forest and by several pairs of eyes glowing at her out of the dark protecting one of the young foxes from a hunting bird of prey meating a brown bear finally saving her fox from a hunting pride of wolves scaring the wolves away by jumping and shouting on the top of her voice.After all these adventures and after becoming accustomed to the fox behaving as a tame animal the girl starts playing children's role games while the fox is around: giving the fox a name talking to it imagining a house in the middle of the wood lighting a fire ""on the hearth"" treating the fox as ""her dog"" giving it a necklace and a leash. Finally she leads the fox to the house where she lives and even though it is very frightened it follows her up the stairs into her chamber. She tries to play with ""her"" fox as people would at times play with a dog: for example hiding under the bed and the table and chasing each other around the room nearly starting a tussle on the floor. But it turns out the the fox cannot stand the closed room: It starts jumping along the walls and across the furniture trying to escape throwing toys off the shelves breaking dishes and vases getting more and more agitated finally jumping in panic out through the closed window breaking the glass. The girl finds it in the court covered with blood and having lost conscience.Strangely enough even though the girl is obviously used to keeping pets and farm animals the thought of searching help from a veterinarian doesn't occur to her. Perhaps she has still kept the fox as a secret she didn't tell even her parents about; perhaps the next veterinarian is living so far away that she has no hope to carry the fox that far; perhaps she thinks that no man would tend a fox often having seen hunters catching shooting even poisoning foxes. Anyway she carries the fox back to its kennel rather mourning for it than tending it not even removing the necklace before the young foxes start tearing at the cloth. In fact it's rather the young foxes tending their mother licking its wounds.The girl is deeply shocked and ashamed and utterly helpless. When she sees that the fox still lives not knowing whether it will indeed survive she finally walks away. During the following days she often returns to the places where the two liked to meet but never again she approaches the kennel. The girl feels that her friendship with the fox can never again be exactly as it was before. In a way she has betrayed their friendship. All the same that autumn and during part of the winter the two sometimes meet in the wild the girl now treating the fox with tender but restrained respect. During the winter the girl loses track of the fox never seing it again.A decade later she explains to her young son the lesson she learnt from that episode: True friendship between human and animal is extremely difficult to attain because the human will inevitably be tempted to domesticate the animal changing its character and life longing to own it instead of just watching liking and meeting it. After the horrible scene in her chamber the girl decided that the wild animal must always be free to decide what it wants and what it doesn't want to do: ""I promised to the fox that it must always be her to choose the game that never again i would try to force any game upon her - because i could never know whether she would like it."""
"It has been described as both a nature documentary and a ""fairy tale"" look at the story of young girl and her friendship with a fox.::Luc_Jacquet"
Riding her bicycle on her way to school a dreamy ten-year-old red-haired farm girl decides to take a shortcut through a ruddy and luscious autumn forest somewhere in the mountainous region of eastern France. Unexpectedly the young girl encounters a bright-eyed red fox however the untamed wild animal flees in an instant leaving her longing to meet again. Since then a whole winter has passed and still no sign of the elusive fox but with the arrival of spring the girl determined to find the animal finally locates its den and an ambitious effort to grow accustomed to each other begins. As we witness a succession of compelling scenes lost inside the enchanting and breathlessly exquisite landscape we observe the bond between a human and a savage animal grow gradually stronger yet a wish and question emerge. If only we humans could talk to the wild beasts and if we could could we ever become friends?::Nick Riganas

Dick who is leaving for Paris the next day assures Ruth that Tom was more vain than heroic and counsels her not to take his legacy too seriously.Later Ruth is awakened in the middle of the night by the sound of John and his friends playing polo on bicycles across the mansion's spacious floors. When Ruth tells John she was frightened by the noise he coldly dismisses her fears as childish. Ruth runs crying back to her bedroom and suddenly shamed John follows and apologizes.The next day Ruth notices Appuhamy praying at the foot of Tom's grave and tours the enormous kitchen with him. Appuhamy shows Ruth the items that were special favorites of ""the old master"" which are still being purchased and balks when she offers to plan the menu so as to reduce the amount of waste generated by the plantation. Appuhamy also refuses to give Ruth the key to Tom's old study piquing Ruth's curiosity.That night Dick stops by to say farewell and before going encourages Ruth to contact him if she needs help. Later John fractures his leg while drunkenly playing bicycle polo and is confined to his bed. During his convalescence Ruth tries to sneak into Tom's study but hides when Appuhamy appears. After overhearing Appuhamy declare to a portrait of Tom that Ruth ""does not belong"" at Elephant Walk Ruth learns from John's doctor that John's belligerent attitudes are impeding his recovery. Ruth writes to Dick for help and he quickly returns and resumes his work as overseer.John's mood does not improve however as the expected monsoons have not started and the elephants have become agitated over the lack of water. When John yells at her for changing his lunch menu without permission Ruth rushes to Dick and while out riding with him confesses that John is still ruled by his dead father. Dick kisses Ruth who despite her attraction pulls away protesting that she still loves John. Back at the plantation John apologizes to Ruth and tries to appease her by announcing a special upcoming celebration.The celebration turns out to be an elaborate birthday party for Tom and Ruth finally explodes with frustration ordering John's drunken friends out of the house. The next morning John condemns Ruth for driving his friends away and when she insists that he hates Tom as much as she does slaps her. Stunned Ruth runs to Dick's quarters and begs him to take her to Paris. At the same time however one of John's servants collapses with cholera and the plantation is placed under quarantine.Trapped at Elephant Walk Ruth and Dick toil long hours to help John curb the epidemic and soothe the terrified workers. When John who is aware of Ruth's plans to leave him insists on burying the dead himself Ruth is impressed by his selfless dedication. Later after the quarantine is lifted Ruth tells Dick that she cannot leave John before the rains come despite Dick's protests that John has not changed.As a final precaution the workers' huts are set ablaze and the elephants agitated by the fire start to stampede. With no workers available to beat them back the elephants crash through the plantation wall and storm the house. Appuhamy who has finally recognized Ruth's true worth rushes to alert her and is killed by an angry elephant. While crashing through the house the elephants cause a fire to erupt and John barely arrives in time to rescue Ruth. Just then the rain starts and as Elephant Walk burns to the ground John and Ruth embrace and pledge to start a new life together."

"On February 20 1963 a young girl named Andie (Hollye Rebecca Suggs) is laying out under the stars somewhere in the rural farmlands of America trying to see if she can spot Friendship 7 during its return to Earth after its historic orbital mission. She noticed what looks like a shooting star which blinks in the sky. Taking this as John Glenn winking at her Andie promises herself that one day she too will become an astronaut.23 years later Andie Bergstrom (Kate Capshaw) flies a T-38 Talon into John F. Kennedy Space Center and meets her husband fellow astronaut and former moonwalker Zack Bergstrom (Tom Skeritt) on the tarmac. She is now in NASA's astronaut program but has not flown into space yet. In fact she's upset that she was passed up for a coming mission. Zack immediately cashes in on a promise she made if she didn't get the flight: he recruits her as an instructor for that summer's Space Camp program.As registration begins among the arrivals for the program is Kevin Donaldson (Tate Donovan) driving his new Jeep. Initially he rubs Zack the wrong way by parking in his spot. After he moves his Jeep he notices the young female pilot of a biplane flying in: Kathryn Fairly (Lea Thompson). Immediately smitten he catches up behind her in the registration line. Wanting to get closer to her he steals somebody else's credentials so he can end up in the Blue Team the same team as her.As it so happens the Blue Team is the one being instructed by Andie Bergstrom whom Kathryn idolizes as one of the few female pilots in the shuttle program. She realises that Donaldson is not on her list of students but as Hideo Takamini (Scott Holcomb) isn't around she just lets things be. In addition to Kathryn and Kevin three others make up the team. Tish Ambrosei (Kelly Preston) has the look of a valley girl but is highly intelligent with a photographic memory and a perfect SAT score. Rudy Tyler (Larry B. Scott) is a young African American man from a military family; he loves science but isn't very good at it. Last there's Max Graham (Joaquin Phoenix) a kid with a Star Wars obsession that is still young enough for the junior program. Andie permits Max on the team since he's been in the junior program for the past two years.Andie gives shuttle positions to each of the cadets. To everyone's surprise the seemingly irresponsible Kevin is made Shuttle Commander while Kathryn who aspires to be a real Commander one day is named the Pilot. The others are Mission Specialists. Tish is responsible for communications while Rudy is responsible for operations. Max is not given a specific area of responsibility.During the initial tour the Blue Team is introduced to a ""prototype maintenance droid"" a robot called ""Jinx"" (Frank Welker's voice). He was intended for use on a future space station but too many bugs in his AI programming relegated him to service work around the Cape. Max hides Jinx in his closet. One night Jinx is teased by other members of the Space Camp particularly the Green Team who ask him to do twenty things at the same time resulting in frying his circuitry. Max spends the night repairing Jinx and the two become as Jinx says ""friends forever"".For the Blue Team Space Camp is anything but smooth sailing. Although they develop a camraderie together they have difficulties working together as a team largely the result of Kevin not taking his position as Commander seriously. Kathryn in addition is frustrated by her inability to master the multi-axis trainer a prerequisite for any real shuttle pilot.Kevin succeeds in bonding with Kathryn and gets directions from Jinx to a good place to see the Space Shuttle Atlantis on the pad so he can sneak out with her. Unfortunately Jinx readily rats them out to Zack when they turn up missing. Kevin blames Max for Jinx's betrayal leading Max to wish aloud while wandering the camp alone that he were in space. Overhearing him Jinx takes it literally and works with other NASA computers to figure out a way to get Max into space. Meanwhile Andie and Kathryn had the opportunity of having a chat together: Andie complais that Kathryn is much more tougher on her than on the rest and Kathryn reminds her that she will only be able to command a shuttle if she is best than all the others.Tensions in the Blue Team come to a head when they end up screwing up in a simulation. The Green Team arranges for the electric power to create a circuit malfunction. Kevin didn't take the situation seriously Tish and Rudy argued about what do; Kathryn left her place as pilot to go and argue some more with Rudy and Tish. All this happening while Max is left outside on the outer arm being jarred repeatedly and getting dizzy. All this led to disaster: if there had been a real-life situation they all would have died. While Kevin doesn't think it's a big deal Andie has to lecture him on responsibility.The Blue Team earns a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity: they will sit in Atlantis during a test firing of its main engines. This gives Jinx his chance. During the test Jinx orders a computer to send a code to Launch Control: a ""thermal curtain failure"" in one of the solid rocket boosters. Unlike the main engines which can be turned off the solid rockets cannot be stopped once lit essentially requiring Atlantis to be launched. Atlantis with the Blue Team on-board successfully reaches orbit. However they have two problems both caused by the fact that Atlantis was not yet equipped for an actual launch. It does not have its normal communications equipment installed and it only carries 12 hours worth of oxygen. They do not have enough oxygen to get to the next available window or opportunity to safely land at Edwards Air Force Base the normal Shuttle Landing facility.Unable to communicate directly with only telemetry relaying between the ground and Atlantis Launch Control director (Terry O'Quinn) and the Blue Team both think of how to get more oxygen and get home. Andie remembers something: Space Station Daedalus under construction but already carrying extra oxygen canisters. They could recharge their own oxygen tanks there. During the transit to Daedalus Tish begins to use one of the telemetry switches the ""CXT switch"" to attempt to reach Launch Control via Morse code. When they reach Daedalus Andie begins a dangerous solo spacewalk to get an oxygen tank from the space station. However she is too big to reach any of the tanks through the station's truss structure. Max agrees to go out in a suit scrunched down to his smaller size by one of Tish's belts and he successfully grabs two tanks; one for a backup. Before they get back to Atlantis Max accidentally ends up hurtling away from the space station but Andie uses her manned manuevering unit to catch up to him and bring him back safely.During the misadventure Atlantis runs out of oxygen reserves leaving those inside with just the air in the cabin. When Andie goes to fill the tanks there is a problem. She cannot decide which of the four tanks needs to be filled first. Rudy and Kathryn each have a different choice. There are four valves: from left to right a single-headed blue valve a red valve a yellow valve and a double-headed blue valve. They must be filled in the proper sequence. Rudy thinks it's the blue valve next to the yellow while Kathryn thinks it's the blue valve next to the red. Rudy tells Andie to go for the one next to the yellow valve. It works. The tank is emptied completely into Atlantis buying them 12 extra hours on orbit if necessary. Finding out that Atlantis has more oxygen via telemetry Launch Control puts the shuttle on auto so it will take the next available window to landing.However Andie connects the second tank to the second head on the double-headed blue valve instead of going to the yellow valve and blows the tank off of the connection sending her hurtling into the back of the payload bay. Andie is left unconscious seriously injured and floating slowly out to space. Max tries to pull her in by her lifeline but the payload bay doors close pinning Andie outside of Atlantis. Kevin makes a choice: he overrides the auto landing missing the window for Edwards AFB and reopens the payload bay doors bringing Andie back inside Atlantis. The Blue Team immediately explores other options to get home as they again do not have enough oxygen to get to the next window for Edwards AFB and don't have enough air left in the space suits to return for more oxygen at Daedalus.They begin to explore other places to land and figure something out: White Sands Missile Range New Mexico where Columbia had to land at the end of STS-3. Just as they begin their preparations Jinx who has discovered Tish's Morse code reaches Launch Control and brings the contact to Zack's attention. NASA finally acknowledges the Blue Team and quickly learns the full situation.Andie wakes up but is still hurt badly and it's up to Kevin Kathryn Tish Rudy and Max to land Atlantis. Kathryn takes the role of pilot just as in Space Camp. It's then that her worst fear comes to pass: Atlantis enters a flat spin after its deorbit burn exactly the situation that the multi-axis trainer simulates. Kathryn manages to regain control of Atlantis. After a tough manual reentry Atlantis makes it safely to a landing at White Sands."

"Amid a sea of gently-waving tall grass lies the factory of Zevo Toys founded by Kenneth Zevo as a place where 'joy and innocence prevail.' Kenneth works in his whimsical factory along with his children Leslie and Alsatia.In recent months Kennth has grown deathly ill and sends for his Militaristic brother General Leland Zevo. Upon meeting his brother Kenneth explains that he wants Leland to take control of Zevo Toys once he dies. This strikes Leland as a very strange request since he is not at all like his brother and is more concerned with the 'rank and file' of his former glory days.Eventually Kenneth dies and Leland is still not sure what to do. He goes to consult with their father a bed-ridden retired 4-star general. But even this doesn't lead to any answers. Leland finally decides to fulfill his brother's request but even with Leslie and Alsatia welcoming him to the factory and trying to get him acclimated Leland seems largely like a 'fish out of water' not seeing the humor or fun in the factory's workings.During a board meeting word of industrial espionage rouses his attention. Consulting with Kenneth's former advisor Owen Owens Leland decides to implement some changes.At a formal dinner at Leslie and Alsatia's home they are introduced to Leland's son Patrick a master of camouflage. Leland takes the opportunity to explain to everyone about his upcoming plans. Patrick is being implemented to step-up security measures to prevent future information leaks and Leland also plans to start a new line of 'war toys' a concept that has never been introduced in the factory.Some months pass and a major security detail is now in place with the once happy workers now rather dour. Leland has grown upset that the design teams are not fulfilling his vision for a war toys line and berates them much to Leslie's displeasure. While passing by the copy room Leslie meets Gwen Tyler (Robin Wright) who he soon strikes up a conversation with and finds her to have a rather intriguing personality. Leslie also finds out that Gwen was hired by his father right before he died.Later that evening Leland and Patrick go into town where they peruse a video arcade watching children play intently at the flickering game consoles. Going to a local toy store Leland is amazed at what other companies have produced in regards to war toys. As they drive back to the country Leland and Patrick stop at a small pond and contemplate. Leland soon hits on an epiphany: what if military aircraft and hardware could be made smaller? After all the reason they are so large is because they need a human being inside to man them. What if the human person operated the craft by remote control? Plus this could allow Military spending to become less cumbersome!The next day Leslie meets with Leland to discuss his feelings about the 'war toys' line. Leslie contends that Zevo Toys has always been moreso about children and war toys would bring a change to his father's philosophy. Leland 'plays along' with this and claims he agrees but asks Leslie if he could have some space to work on some of his own ideas for potential toys. Leslie agrees to this but then notices some rather startling changes going on around the factory.Leland keeps asking for more space which begins to 'shrink' other departments in the factory. Alsatia's department is also shut down and a number of workers are fired. Owen Owens tells Leslie about children being brought into the factory but has no idea where they are going to. Leslie confronts Leland about what he's doing but the General is tight-lipped and refuses to say more.Leslie ends up obtaining a security key to the General's secret project and after staging an elaborate plan to distract the guards gains access to the secret room. Inside he finds numerous children at videogame consoles playing simulations of fighter craft in war-like scenarios. Leslie's presence is soon found out and he attempts to escape but falls into a pit in which a strange creature named the 'sea-swine' inhabits. Patrick and the General find Leslie in the tank and the two are at odds with the other: Patrick wants to save Leslie but the General refuses.Leslie manages to secretly make his way out of the sea-swine enclosure and reports to his family and friends what he's seen. Leslie then has a confrontation with the General about what he's seen but the General refuses to tell more other than requesting two weeks to finish his project at which time he promises to show them what he's doing.After the meeting Patrick informs the General that some men from Washington D.C. are coming to meet with him. The General is ecstatic and a top-secret location is set-up a ways outside the factory with tight security. The General states his vision for the future but the men at the meeting are still unsure about his plan. Their negative attitude towards his ideas infuriates the General causing him to strangle one of the men. The General appears to have gone power-mad as later on that evening while sitting in his office he attempts to take care of an errant fly by shooting it with a pistol...and succeeds in shooting himself in the foot.By now Patrick has grown upset with his father's 'conduct' and goes to Leslie's place where he explains to Leslie Alsatia Gwen and Owen about what the General has been up to and that they have to stop him. Sneaking into the factory Patrick and the others split up trying to find the main control center where the General is.The General uses this to his advantage letting loose some cute-yet-deadly toys before setting his military-style 'Tommy Tanks' and 'Hurly-Burly Helicopters' on them. Leslie Alsatia Gwen and Owen end up finding their way into a storage warehouse where the General had the older Zevo Toys stored. Devising a plan Leslie has the old toys wound up and put to battle against the General's creations. As the battle rages on Leslie runs off to find Patrick. He winds up in a room outside the General's offices that resembles a miniature of New York City where Patrick explains that he's been wounded and that Leslie has to get to the General's room and shut off the controls.Getting into a small plane over the New York model Leslie tries to pilot it into the General's office where he confronts the General and manages to shut off the controls.As the machines shut down Alsatia Gwen and Owen join Leslie. However the sea-swine has also been activated and tries to kill Leslie but misses and hits Alsatia causing her head to fly off. It is then revealed that she is a robot that was created as a playmate for Leslie by his father. In the confusion the General attempts to escape but is attacked by the sea-swine.Time passes and Leslie has now assumed control of Zevo Toys returning it to it's more innocent state. The General has now become bed-ridden and now shares quarters with his father as well.The film ends with Leslie Alsatia Gwen and Patrick visiting Kenneth's Zevo's grave. Patrick then says his goodbyes and wanders off into the sea of waving tall-grass.

Holt also introduces Jane to her father's mistress a native woman Parker calls ""Africa"" (Akushula Selayah).That night Jane dines with Parker and informs him that her mother recently died leaving Jane a wealthy heiress. She hates her father for leaving shortly after her birth and only knows him through newspaper clippings of his adventures. Parker insists he loved them and still carries a photograph of his wife and baby daughter.In the morning Jane learns that her father is searching for the legendary elephant graveyard and declares she is joining the expedition over Parker's objections. Jane is adamant so Parker gives her a pistol and they set off into the jungle. Later they reach a mountain of rock that must be scaled. As they camp for the night Parker announces Jane must return to base camp in the morning and report on his ""remarkable"" progress. That evening they hear someone yell and Parker claims it is the legendary Tarzan (Miles O'Keeffe) a gigantic white man who might be half ape. The native porters are frightened of Tarzan and do not want to continue so Parker offers more money. When Tarzan yells again Parker orders Africa to shame the workers by telling them she is not afraid to continue.The next day Jane announces she is climbing the mountain too despite her father's protests. The rope wears thin as each person scales the mountain face and as the last worker climbs the rope breaks and the man falls to his death. Later Parker shows Jane a map he found in a Cairo Egypt museum revealing the route taken by an Egyptian expedition 1000 years ago to a graveyard of ivory near an inland sea.

As they journey through the jungle the expedition is unaware that members of an unfriendly tribe follow them. Africa is abducted by the savage tribe but Parker mistakenly thinks Tarzan kidnapped her and it fuels his desire to kill the ape man.As they continue through the jungle Jane stops at the river to fill her canteen and Parker orders Holt to watch her. However Holt turns his back for a second and Tarzan pulls Jane under the water and they disappear. He carries her through the jungle swinging on vines. When they stop Jane fires her gun as a warning and Tarzan runs away.Jane maneuvers through the jungle and hears a shot fired in the distance as Parker and Holt try to locate her. She fires in response and leans against a tree to wait for them. However an enormous snake wraps itself around her and she falls into the water while struggling to escape. Tarzan swings to the rescue battles the snake and carries Jane off. He swings her through the jungle until he cannot move anymore then drops to the ground unconscious.

Edward McKinley) is asked about the chances for a successful retrieval and voices his opinion. Major Lyman Ross (Gordon Barnes) is asked about establishing any communications with the ship and reports none. Treegar adjourns the meeting telling all assembled they will leave for a base in Nevada immediately.A B-52 is flown to the Nevada Base. Inside the control room the ship is spotted on radar. They are able to remotely return the rocket to Earth. Prof. Weiner leads the effort. Treegar orders Lt. Col. Davis (Jack Haddock) to compute and report the arrival time for the ship. The newspaper headlines inform us ""Mars Rocket Due Tonight Landing in Nevada at 9:12 p.m."" but another asks ""Is Mars Rocket Crew Alive?"" A TV newscaster (Don Lamond) informs listeners that the ship will be returned to a remote Air Force Base in Nevada. We are introduced via earlier broadcast footage of the crew: Col. Tom O'Bannion (Gerald Mohr) Dr. Iris Ryan (Naura Hayden as Nora Hayden) Prof. Theodore Gettell (Les Tremayne) and Chief Warrant Officer Sam Jacobs (Jack Kruschen).The military men and firefighters wait for the landing and speculate on the crew's condition. The ship is spotted in the night sky. It lands successfully. A radiation detection crew is sent over first and reports that all counts are safe. The recovery squad is sent next. The door opens on the ship. Two Jeeps and an ambulance rush to the rocket. Dr. Ryan is alive but must be assisted. O'Bannion is carried off on a stretcher. Prof. Weiner comforts Ryan and tells her everything that can be done for O'Bannion will be done. Her reply is ""How can anyone cope with that?""At the USAF Norwood Hospital O'Bannion is being treated behind a screen. Dr. Frank Gordon (Tom Daly) tells the other doctors that he has administered a sedative. He removes his examination gloves and places them in a bag being held by Nurse Hayes (Brandy Bryan). Dr. Muller (Duke Norton) asks about the growth on O'Bannion's arm but Gordon admits he is stumped. He notes only that it is growing. Muller asks if there was any information gleaned from the tapes and is told that all the tapes examined to date were blank. Dr. Hawley (William Remick) asks ""No tapes at all?"" Gordon clarifies that the tapes were marked but there is nothing on them--as if they were all erased by a powerful magnetic force. Dr. Hawley expresses hope that Iris may be of some help.Dr. Ryan is resting in a hospital bed. Treegar is talking to her about the flight. Nurse Dixon (Joan Fitzpatrick) Dr. Gordon and Prof. Weiner are standing next to her bed. Iris asks about Tom. She is frustrated that she cannot remember any details about what happened to Tom. Treegar asks her to start from the beginning. Iris tells her story.After takeoff the radiation counter jumped. It was attributed to a radioactive meteor approaching. Visual examination by Iris and Sam at the view window confirms its approach. It comes close but misses the ship. Tom and Gettell join them at the window and they see the planet Mars in the distance. Sam performs a routine radio check while iris and Gettell take notes. Sam and the professor take a nap leaving Iris and Tom for the first watch. 17 days into the flight things are still fine. Tom and Iris get lunch: canned rations. They talk about Mars and their mission. Tom constantly addresses Iris as Irish and Iris calls him on it. Sam reads a pulp science fiction article about creatures on Mars. It is Day 29 and still things are normal. Sammy labels and stores the tapes and Iris cleans the microscope and camera. It is now Day 47 and Sammy reports that they are orbiting Mars and beginning their descent onto the planet. They land and Sammy jokes ""Well should we go out and claim the planet in the name of Brooklyn?"" They open the view plate and turn on the outside microphones. It is still and silent. Gottell and Iris start their tests. A crash is heard on the deck above but it was only Iris dropping a tray of test tubes. She tripped over Sammy's flight suit. Gottell determines the atmosphere is thin but contains oxygen. They landed near the Martian Equator. The thin atmosphere accounts for the silence and lack of movement of the plants. They decide to suit up and explore outside. Iris looks to the outside via the porthole window and sees the face of a three-eyed monster. She screams and she is back in her hospital bed.Treegar asks her what happened. She can't remember. Gordon orders a sedative sodium aluminol. Nurse Dixon prepares the drug. Gordon states she has a mental block ""Her mind refuses to remember."" Treegar speculates that the alien infection could spread to all humans and that every moment counts. Weiner proposes narcosynthesis. Gordon is reluctant to use that technique ""Her mind might snap if we forced her to remember the horror she has so carefully obliterated from her conscious level."" Iris asks Gordon how Tom is doing and Gordon reveals that Tom is getting worse. She agrees to the narcosynthesis. Gordon injects Iris with the drug and she nods off.Iris wakes on the ship surrounded by the crew. They ask about what she saw and she tells them it was horrible. They see nothing but she describes it as a ""huge distorted face with three bulging eyes."" Tom and Gettell set off for the outside. They intended to leave Iris and Sammy behind but both object and join their colleagues on the journey outside. Tom is the first outside. [Note: We are now experiencing ""Cinemagic"" which is nothing more than filming through an orange filter with the picture somewhat solarized.] We see the Mars landscape of weird plants and a stalagmite-shaped rocky landscape. Iris is next out of the ship followed by Gettell with Sammy last out of the rocket. Sammy carries a new weapon an ultrasonic freeze gun. Sammy test fires at a plant and Tom hits it knocking off a piece which sounds like breaking glass. They head off into the jungle. Iris and Gettell take pictures then stop to get a better look at some plants. Iris notes the plants have very little chlorophyll but seem to have a nervous system. She picks up a vine and follows it to a very strange plant. It resembles a monstrous venus fly trap. She finds what appears to be the bone of some creature. The arm of the plant wraps around her and pulls her towards its mouth. She screams for help. Tom hacks at its arms with a machete. Once free Sammy shoots the plant with his ultrasonic freeze gun. They return to the plant and Gettell explains that it is more than a plant ""Its a low form of neuromuscular vegetal creature."" They decide to return to the ship and call it a day. Iris takes Sammy's picture with his new toy. Gettell suspects they are being watched and that some control is being exerted over the plants. They notice their Earth contact is an hour late. Their radio transmission bounces back so they are now out of contact with Earth.The next morning they venture out for another exploration mission. They leave the jungle and enter a drier area. They spot what appears to be a grove of strange looking trees. Tom and Iris walk over and Iris uses the machete to remove what appears to be a dead branch. The tree screeches and begins to move. What we see is described by Sammy later as a ""rat-bat-spider nightmare"" an apt description. It lumbers over Tom and Iris and approaches Gottell who has wedged himself between two rocks. Sammy fires the gun at the creature but it has no effect. Finally a shot in the eyes blinds the creature and it walks away screeching in pain. They decide to continue their journey. They find a lake. Gottell checks it for radiation. Iris swishes her hand in the liquid and discovers it is somewhat oily. They agree to return the next day with a boat. After they depart the area the three-eyed creature pops up from behind a rock to watch them. Tom and Gettell discuss the day's events and decide to cut the mission short. Tom proposes they depart tonight. Gettell is convinced there is something dangerous observing them. They launch the rocket but a very powerful force holds them on the surface. They are stuck on Mars. Gettell is vindicated and says ""The control. Whoever they are they don't want us to leave."" They speculate on why they are being held prisoners on Mars. Since they are stuck they decide to use the boat and see what is across the lake. They paddle until they see a huge city of skyscrapers a half-mile high. The lake begins to boil and something rises before them. It is dome-shaped with a central crest running down its length. It sports an eye that stares at them. They paddle their inflatable boat as quickly as possible as the creature chases them. Once on land they are again observed by the three-eyed Martian. The creature makes land rolling over their boat. Sammy's gun has no effect on this weird blob with tentacles. It chases them through the jungle to their ship. The crew runs into the ship but Sammy makes one last attempt to stop the creature. He is pulled into the blob. It consumes the man and his body disappears. Tom orders the door closed. Gettell opens the view ports. They see what appears to be multiple colored blobs of Jello being smeared on the glass--the creature has surrounded the ship. Iris notices Tom's arm is covered with a piece of the creature. It has burned through his suit. Iris treats the wound. Gettell asks Iris about the creature. She speculates it is a single-celled creature like an amoeba that digests using a strong acid. She explains that amoeba are very hard to kill but they do respond to electricity. The plan is to route the ship's power to the outside hull through the instrument cable. They agree and electrocute the creature. Unfortunately the stress and strain causes Gettell to have a heart attack. Gettell dismisses it as just a bit of strain. The radio activates and Iris turns on the recorder. The Martian has a message for the crew ""Men of Earth we of the planet Mars give you this warning. Listen carefully and remember."" Iris sees the three-eyed creature in the view plate and collapses.The ship is far out into space when she comes to. Gettell is in command and very sick. He blames the takeoff and acceleration pressure. He has a trickle of blood down the right side of his mouth. With his dying breath he tells her to check on Tom in the cabin above. Tom is in his bunk covered with a blanket. When Iris goes to pull back the blanket Tom's arm swings down. It is covered with a green and black substance like Jello. It runs from his elbow to his knuckles. Iris goes below and looks outside through the view plate. She sees the planet Mars in the distance. She tries to make sense of the wiring mess then returns to stare at Gettell's body.She is back in her hospital bed and calls to Tom. Treegar asks about the warning. She remembers the last tape may have the answer. Gordon concludes they are facing an enzymatic infection. Tom is awake and being treated but with little improvement. It is only slowing the growth. Iris assists with the research. She tells her colleagues ""Dr.Gordon I think we've found the solution."" She tells them electricity can be used to lure it to a tissue culture to avoid the electric shocks.Sometime later Iris sits by Tom's bed. It is clear he has improved as the bandage on his arm is very small now. Treegar and Weiner come into Tom's hospital room with a tape recorder. The last tape had the warning ""Men of Earth we of the planet Mars give you this warning. Listen carefully and remember. We have known your planet Earth since the first creature crawled out of the primeval slime of your seas to become man. For millennia we have followed your progress. For centuries we have watched you listened to your radio signals and learned your speech and your culture. And now you have invaded our home. Technological adults but spiritual and emotional infants. We kept you here deciding your fate. Had the lower life forms of life of our planet destroyed you we would not have interfered but you survived. Your civilization has not progressed beyond destruction war and violence against yourselves and others. Do as you will to your own and to your planet but remember this warning. Do not return to Mars. You will be permitted to leave for this sole purpose. Carry the warning to Earth. Do not come here. We can and will destroy you all life on your planet if you do not heed us. You have seen us been permitted to glimpse our world. Go now warn mankind not to return unbidden."" We close with title and credits."

The plucky little #53 VW Bug named Herbie was once one of the most popular vehicles on the racing circuit in his day. However over time his popularity waned until he eventually finds himself in the hands of a junk yard owner named Crazy Dave who is planning to eventually crush the little beetle into scrap.Meanwhile Maggie Peyton has just graduated from college and is planning to head to New York after the summer to work for ESPN. Though she appears happy for these plans she secretly harbors a wish to race just like her Father Grandfather and Brother. However while her Father and Grandfather had the 'ambition and drive' her brother Rey Payton Jr just doesn't have it.After her graduation Rey Payton Sr takes his daughter to Crazy Dave's to pick out a used car of her own. Through a mishap perpetrated by Herbie Maggie ends up as the beetle's new owner. However once she starts Herbie up he takes off in a mad dash to a nearby garage owned by a young man named Kevin who is a friend of Maggie's.Noting Herbie's condition Kevin decides to go with Maggie for a drive to test Herbie out. However Herbie ends up driving the two of them to a local exotic car show where famed NASCAR racer Trip Murphy is making a publicity appearance. After Trip makes a rude comment about Herbie's condition the little beetle creates a major scratch along the side of Trip's personal vehicle. A race soon ensues and Maggie (wearing a racing outfit with a darkened helmet) manages to beat Trip.Herbie's beating Trip gives Maggie a thrill from winning a street race (something she promised her Dad she wouldn't do again after a serious accident some time before) but plunges Trip into a deep grudge over being beaten by an old VW beetle. Even though his manager (and brother) tells Trip to just ignore the 'fluke win' Trip is determined to get back at Herbie and his racer. Trip then advertises a special racing event in the desert with the promise of a $10000 cash prize to the person who beats him.The ad catches the eye of Maggie and Kevin who feel that the money could be a good thing for Maggie when she moves to New York. The two work to repair Herbie and make him more race-worthy. At the race-off's tryouts Herbie manages to beat all the other competitors. However Trip has been watching Herbie and his mysterious driver and finally confirms that it's Maggie.After the day is over Trip allows Maggie the chance to take his NASCAR racer for a ride in the desert. Trip then attempts to examine Herbie's engine to figure how the bug beat him but Herbie ends up knocking Trip around instead.When Maggie returns Trip tricks Maggie into betting Herbie's ownership on the last race claiming that if Maggie wins she can have his NASCAR racer.The next day Herbie throws the race when Maggie demands they win so she can have Trip's race car. The loss ends in Maggie's duel identity as Herbie's mysterious driver being exposed to the crowd...which also consists of her Dad. Rey Payton Sr angrily tells his displeasure that Maggie went back on her promise not to race and Kevin is upset that Maggie would bet Herbie like she did.Though it seems that everyone is upset with Maggie her college friend Charisma (who was at the race) commends Maggie that she really seems to have a racer's spirit and that it seems she would moreso enjoy racing than the upcoming position with ESPN.After some soul-searching Maggie visits Trip with the intent to buy back Herbie. However Trip has sold Herbie to a demolition derby with the intent that the little beetle will be demolished. Maggie manages to get to the derby but not before Herbie is damaged quite badly.The next day Maggie's brother Rey Jr qualifies for the NEXTEL Cup race but can't race due to a vision impairment. Rey then suggests that Maggie race in his place. Kevin also voices his affirmative but Rey Sr refuses to allow this.That evening Maggie and Kevin assess Herbie's damage and find that they do not have the funds to fix him. However their solution comes in the form of Ray Jr who arrives to tell Maggie that he is going to let her race in the NEXTEL Cup the next day. However Maggie insists that she race in Herbie. Ray Jr and his pit crew then work overnight to fix Herbie and make him NASCAR-certified (as much as a VW Bug can be anyways).The next day Trip Murphy is surprised to see Herbie enter the race. Eventually Herbie manages to outperform most of the race favorites but encounters fuel problems during the final laps. Maggie is more than willing to lose the race if it means Herbie will be alright but Herbie manages to push on intending to win the race...of which Trip is in the lead. It looks like Trip may win the race but his ego gets the better of him and he ends up crashing allowing Herbie and Maggie to win making her the first woman to win the NEXTEL Cup and returning Herbie to prominence in the current racing world.The old legendary Number 53 racing car Herbie a 1963 Volkswagen bug has been forgotten for many years.

"Opening scene is a yelling rioting mob in a heavy rain shower in New York City. They are tearing down a statue of the King of England. Tom Dobb and his young son Ned are sailing into the harbor in a small boat carrying furs. An expensive carriage can barely get through the crowds. Inside the carriage are a wealthy mother Mrs. McConnahay and her daughters who are young women. A man tosses several pages of paper into the carriage window shouting ""The Declaration of Independence!"" One of the daughters Daisy begins to read it but her angry mother takes it away and wads it up telling Daisy to ignore the ""scum"" in the streets.
As Tom pulls his boat up to the dock the mob including Daisy who has joined them demand he give them the boat and cargo. Tom and Ned resist but the mob storms aboard seizing the boat and furs. He is given a 'note' for payment for the boat but now he and his son are homeless and without money or any possessions.As Tom goes into a big hall full of yelling angry men to find out about his boat he tells Ned to wait outside. Inside a man on a balcony tells the crowd that all the money has gone to war but the crowd is furious all of them waving notes for their seized possessions. The man tells them that Mr. McConnahay a wealthy man standing beside him will pay them back with gold after the British are defeated. . When Tom goes back outside he discovers that his son has signed up with the United States Continental Army as a drummer in exchange for five shillings and a promise of land at the end of the war. Tom argues with the recruiter offering the money back and begging him not to take his son who is the last of his family but the recruiters will not let Ned out of military service so Tom is forced to join the Army as well to stay with his son and protect him. Tom and Ned get their guns and provisions and are immediately loaded on one of many boats full of soldiers. None of them wear uniforms but just wear their own clothes. The crowd on the dock wave them off cheering and yelling ""Liberty!""Daisy volunteers for the Patriots' cause by bringing supplies to a battlefield medical tent and she is needed to assist a surgeon cutting off a woman's leg with a saw while the woman screams. All around the tents are vast fields of yellow flowering weeds. Daisy walks through the tall weeds looking for soldiers to feed. She finds Tom and Ned lying in the fields gives them food and draws close to Tom as she asks him what the battle was like. Tom tells her that the battle was beneath the Brooklyn Heights that they never saw the enemy but were torn apart by their cannons and chain shot and they lost the battle. Daisy cries because she is so moved emotionally that Tom would fight for the cause of freedom. At least half a dozen men on horses gallop up suddenly yelling for all the men lying in the fields to get up and fall into rank and the scene closes showing long lines of men marching out as several women watch.Back home in New York Daisy overhears a business meeting her father Mr. Mconnahay is having with several men. She hears him say that he is happy the Continentals lost the battle because soon the British army will occupy New York and his company will make a lot of money by selling them food including spoiled goods. Daisy demands that her father give some food to the Rebels. He admonishes her about her youthful idealism and tells her it doesn't matter who wins as long as he and their family are on the right side. He tells her he'll give 50 barrels of food to the Rebels but after she leaves he tells his clerk to revise the number down to 10.Next scene shows Tom and Ned along with the Continental Army preparing for battle with the Red Coats. They are all getting behind cover to hide such as trees rocks and brush wearing brown and tan clothing. The British meanwhile march toward them in straight lines right out in the open in the old fashioned European style and they have far more numbers than the Continentals. Their uniforms are clean and new and their equipment is obviously superior to that of the Continentals. Drummer boys and flutists play as they march. As the British march toward them the Rebels open fire shooting down many but the British never break ranks. Finally they stop marching and shoot in unison. The Americans are badly massacred and retreat. Survivors of the barrage fall back to a second line of defense then flee as the British chase them with bayonets and lances. Tom engages with British major Peasy who is using a lance and disarms Tom from his rifle and bayonet and later from an American his son has rescued. Still moving away from the battlefield afterward the Continental troops are scattered and Tom tells Ned they are going to quit the Army and go back to New York where he can work in the rope factory.As predicted by Mr. McConnahay the British do indeed occupy New York and scenes show several hundred British troops marching in the streets as hundreds more citizens watch them. Officers make speeches in the public square and Mr. McConnahay is up on the stage with British generals and officers. Two of his daughters heavily layered in make-up in the style of European aristocracy are excited about their chances of meeting eligible British officers. Daisy meanwhile without make-up and dressed in black as if mourning spots Tom in the crowd and talks to him. Crying she accuses him of cowardice for running away even though he explains that the whole Army ran away. Tom then leaves her taking his son Ned to an encampment of homeless people under a wooden walkway to seek shelter.Daisy returns home to the wealthy mansion of her parents where a party is being planned by her mother Mrs. McConnahay for two single British officers that will be housed with them. Daisy wants no part of it but her mother orders her to attend. The party is a very fancy affair with white make-up and gigantic powder wigs with sculptures of castles and sailing ships in them. The women wear fancy dresses and the British officers wear dress uniforms as they sip drinks. One of the girls plays harpsichord. Another daughter flirts with a British officer. Daisy begins to flirt with the same officer until suddenly stabbing him in the groin with a giant pin from her wig. The officer screams calls her and her sisters ""bloody Yankee bitches!"". The party is ruined and ends abruptly. Daisy goes to her bedroom screams and throws a fit kicking her furniture and tearing the room apart until her mother comes in and tells her she has shamed her family and that now she must choose between her family and the rebel Patriots.Running with a gang of youths called the Mohawks who commit small crimes and plan to blow up a bomb to kill British soldiers in town Ned steals a live pig but it squirms out of his grasp and gets away. Ned finds Tom at his job in the rope factory and Tom tells Ned that he must not run with the Mohawks or he could get killed by the British. At that moment British soldiers come into the factory and pick a couple of men including Tom making them run in place. They explain they are organizing a fox hunt but can find no foxes so Tom and another man must run in the place of the fox dragging a lure. Ned hates seeing his father jump at the command of the soldiers effectively calls him a coward and leaves to join up with his gang.The hunt begins with blowing horns and many hunting dogs barking. Tom and the other man a big man are tied by the wrists to a heavy effigy of George Washington made of rope and doused with scent. Given a sizable head start they are forced to drag the effigy through wilderness while a group of British officers and civilians chase them on horseback. Tom and the big man argue and separate Tom carrying the heavy effigy over his shoulder. First the dogs hunt down the big man and maul him. Then the dogs are redirected to run down Tom and they attack the effigy. A British officer cuts the rope to the effigy from Tom's wrist and they let him go but Tom is out of breath traumatized and physically exhausted as they ride away.British Sergeant Major Peasy comforts a young drummer boy who is about nine or ten years old at a battlefield burial of some drummer boys. To replace his lost drummer boys Peasy goes to a prison in New York where he finds Ned and Ned's friend Merle who were drummers for the Americans and Merle was captured in the earlier battle. They are practicing drumming and Peasy forces them along with others to serve in the British Army. Daisy sees them leaving prison and followed by her black servant girl Cuffy she searches out Tom to tell him of the capture. Even though he is still exhausted from the 'fox hunt' Tom gets himself up and immediately steals a boat to chase after the departing British Army to rescue his son.The British Army is encamped at night with tents and campfires when an officer orders Peasy to bring him some boys to choose one of them to allegedly shine his boots. Among others Peasy brings Ned and Merle into the officer's tent and as the boys stand in line the officer stops at Ned to touch his face and Ned bites his hand. The officer orders Ned to be tied to a cannon and have the soles of his feet whipped. Tom catches up with the British Army at nightfall and in the midst of a rain storm sneaks into the encampment and finds his son. He cuts Ned loose and because the boy is unable to walk on his bloody feet. Tom carries Ned out of the camp and Merle escapes with them using the British pass he was given for the fox hunt. Peasy discovers that the boys are missing in the morning and promises a high quality knife to two Iroquois scouts if they bring back the prisoners. Peasy questions another drummer boy who confesses he didn't report the escape because he thought Peasy liked Ned more than him. Tom carries Ned into the wilderness followed by Merle and chased by the two Iroquois. The Iroquois spot them and get ahead of them and wreck Tom's boat. Tom and the boys see the Iroquois wrecking the boat and Merle trips over something on the trail and it falls down the cliff into the water and the Iroquois spot them Tom and the boys lie in wait as the natives approach and Tom jumps out from hiding with a knife and kills the first and then with some struggle manages to kill the second Iroquois.No sooner is the fight over than Tom and the boys see three more natives standing in the distance watching them. The natives approach as Tom and the boys stand their ground as it becomes clear that these natives don't want to fight them. One of the natives explains that they are Huron and ""He who kills my enemy is my friend"" and the natives help Tom Ned and Merle by taking them to their village and giving them food and shelter and by treating Ned's severely wounded feet. Ned screams as his feet are cauterized by the natives and Tom holds him in his arms. Tom and Ned stay with the Hurons for six months while Ned's feet heal. Then they come down from the mountains ""to join the fight"".In Valley Forge Daisy drives a horse drawn wagon load of supplies into the camp flying an American flag. Snow falls as she discovers that conditions are harsh and men are wounded and dying and she is told that she will need to evacuate some dying men to a hospital. She meets up by chance with Ned and she sees that he has grown. He tells her that he and Tom are scouts now and he leads her to their tent where he is making bullets with his friend Ongwata one of the natives who helped him and his son in the wilderness. Happy to see Daisy Tom offers her food and they visit together as Ongwata leaves to give them privacy. She tells Tom that she and Cuffy her servant had fled New York to Philadelphia where they joined the Rebels smuggling supplies and that she had learned how to sail. They dream of sailing away together. Ned has become friends with Bella the daughter of a gunner in the Valley Forge fort. Ned's conversation with her reveals that he has a new found respect for his father's courage and fighting abilities and the two have become closer as they have fought together as comrades in arms. Tom and Daisy confess their love to each other as she drives her wagon load of wounded soldiers out of the fort but as she pulls away in the distance Tom sees British cavalry charge the wagons and he chases them by foot helplessly. The British officer Daisy had stabbed is leading the Calvary and swings his sword at Daisy. Tom cannot tell if she is wounded or dead but he wagon is captured and led away by the British.The Americans win the next battle and while on leave in Philadelphia Tom goes into a public building where records are kept of the dead and wounded looking for the name of Daisy McConnahay. He needs help from a woman there because he cannot read. Daisy's name is not in the records however which gives Tom hope that she may still be alive. Meanwhile Ned and Bella wander the building and meet a Harvard student helping Congress to clean up buildings wrecked by British soldiers. The student explains that the term 'revolution' was coined by Mr. Jefferson for their political movement because the world was going through a new turn in history like the moon revolving the Earth. People are generally in a festive mood and the soldiers are singing because the Continental Army has been fairing well. The American soldiers are now much better equipped with real uniforms and boots in good condition. Ned and Bella get married outdoors just before they march off again with the Army.Three years later the story picks up in the middle of the battle of Yorktown. Cannons are firing and the fighting is fierce and violent. From within a fortress father and son fight together taking pot shots at good British targets until Ned spots British officer Peasy who whipped Ned's feet while he had been captive. Tom and Ned watch as Peasy and leads a small group towards the beach towards the American spotter and signaler and they decide to stop Peasy. They run together with Ongwata and another Huron down to the beach where they find Peasy and his companions. Hiding behind cover the Americans shoot the two British soldiers and two Iroquois scouts. Peasy is wounded but his companion the former drummer boy is badly wounded and lying in Peasy's arms. Ned aims his rifle to kill Peasy but decides not to and the Tom and his men take the fallen enemy's weapons and go back to the fort. Peasy begins dragging his wounded comrade back towards the British Army.There is a somber moment while a woman sings a sad song after the battle of Yorktown. The Americans are victorious but dead and wounded lie everywhere and survivors stand listening. Then as the song fades into silence there is a dramatic cut from the silent battlefield to the cheering crowded streets of New York where a merry band is playing countless Americans are waving flags singing dancing and celebrating. Tom cashes in his note for his boat and gets paid only $40 far less than the $70 he had been promised by the American government. He asks what happened to the 150 acres of land he had been promised to join the the Army and the American soldier paying him tells him the land is all gone due to the war debt and if Tom is unhappy then he should complain to Congress. Tom asserts his freedom to complain to anyone he wants. Leaving the soldier Tom meets up with Ned and the rest of their party down the street and gives him the $40 as they say goodbye. Ned is heading upriver with Bella who is pregnant to start a farm and a family. Merle and Bella's father go with them along with their Huron friends. Tom stays in New York where he feels he will have a better chance to earn a living and he still wants to search for Daisy..After watching Ned and the rest leave Tom spots Cuffy Daisy's servant in the crowds of New York where people are still singing dancing and celebrating everywhere literally in the streets. He loses her in the crowd as she is moving quickly. He passes people watching a bare knuckle boxing match but keeps searching until he eventually sees Daisy who is kneeling smiling talking with several small children. She looks up sees Tom and they embrace as the camera pulls back to show the vast numbers of people celebrating and dancing in the city streets."

"The film opens with a scroll saying that when Alfred Hitchcock's film The Birds (1963) was released audiences laughed at the notion of birds revolting against humanity but when an attack perpetrated by birds occurred in 1975 no one laughed. This is followed by a pre-credits sequence of a tomato rising out of a woman's garbage disposal unit. Her puzzlement turns into terror as the tomato draws her into a corner. Following the opening credits the police investigate her death. One officer discovers that the red substance she is covered with is not blood but tomato juice.A series of attacks perpetrated by tomatoes occur (including a man dying by drinking tomato juice made from a killer tomato a boy heard being gobbled up by a killer tomato and a sequence where the tomatoes attack innocent swimmers in a bay area of San Diego in a parody of 'Jaws').While the President's press secretary Jim Richardson tries to convince the public that there is no credible threat the president puts together a team of specialists to stop the tomatoes led by a Euro-American man named Mason Dixon. Dixon's team includes Sam Smith an African-American disguise expert who is seen at various points dressed as among other things George Washington Abraham Lincoln and Adolf Hitler; Euro-American Navy diver Greg Colburn; Central-Russo Russian Olympic swimmer Gretta Attenbaum; and Euro-American parachute-toting soldier Wilbur Finletter.Smith is sent out to infiltrate the tomatoes at a campfire eventually blowing his cover while eating a hamburger and asking if anyone could ""pass the ketchup"". Colburn and Gretta are sent to sectors while Finletter stays with Mason.Meanwhile the president sends Richardson to the fictitious ad agency ""Mind Makers"" where executive Ted Swan spends huge amounts of money to develop virtually worthless ploys including a bumper sticker with ""STP"" for ""Stop Tomato Program"" on it a satirical reference to the real ""whip inflation now"" campaign and its widely ridiculed ""WIN"" slogan. It is revealed that a human is also plotting to stop Dixon when a masked assassin attempts to shoot him but misses.A senate subcommittee meeting is held where one secret pamphlet is leaked to a newspaper editor who sends reporter Lois Fairchild on the story. While she tails Finletter he mistakes her for a spy and trashes a hotel room attempting to kill her. He then chases the assassin as the masked man fails again to kill Dixon but loses him.Gretta is killed and further regression has led leaders to bring in tanks and soldiers to the west coast in a battle that leaves the American forces in shambles. Dixon walking among the rubble sees a trail of tomato juice and decides to investigate. He ends up being chased by a killer tomato to an apartment where an oblivious child is listening to the radio. The tomato is about to kill Dixon but suddenly flies out the window. Dixon peers out to see if it has died when he spots the assassin hijacking his car. He chases the assassin on foot until he is knocked out when it is revealed that Richardson is behind the tomatoes. He is about to reveal his secret of control when Finletter charges in and runs him through. Dixon picking up some strewn records realizes that both times the tomatoes left him the new hit song ""Puberty Love"" had been on the radio. He orders Finletter to gather all remaining people and bring them to the stadium which is soon attacked by the tomatoes.The tomatoes are cornered in a stadium. ""Puberty Love"" is played over the loudspeaker causing the tomatoes to shrink and allowing the various people at the stadium to squash them by stomping on them repeatedly. Fairchild meanwhile is cornered by a giant tomato wearing earmuffs. Dixon saves her by showing the tomato the sheet music to ""Puberty Love."" He professes his love to her in song. The film ends with a carrot that rises from the Earth and says ""All right you guys. They're gone now.""The end credits title card appears which is a joke to stay tuned for the sequel ""Attack of the Killer Carrots""."

The plots of the two films are similar. There are many minor differences and a number of major changes noted below*South Hemi = Soviet Union*North Hemi = United States*The film is set in the future. The opening scenes are set today and a reporter is interviewing scientists about the future of space travel. During a day dream the rest of the film unfolds*The trip from Earth to the space station is not on a purpose built spacecraft but a regularly scheduled flight. Hence the almost airline like interiors of the ship*When Torrent requests help from the space station he is actually still on Earth and is contacting the station in advance to confirm they can refuel at the station*The pilot who arrives with the second supply ship is not killed by the monsters but dies from radiation poisoning because the ship he flew had inadequate shielding against cosmic rays--------------------------------------------------------------------------Opening sceneEarth Nov 7 1997 Following the great nuclear war the Earth has divided into two distinct political entities North Hemis and the South Hemis. Doctor Gordon (Ivan Perevzev) and his wife Ruth are working on a special project for South Hemis. It is called Red Planet first planned mission to Mars Astronaut Craig Mathews (Andrei Gordienko) briefs a journalist on the mission.He cautions that details cant be released to the general public until it is known if the mission is successfull or not. It had been discovered that North Hemis scientists were working on the same project and time was now of the essence. The mission will begin once the required the astronauts arrive at the space station
At the launch pad the astronauts say their last goodbyes to their families. On board the ship Mathews questions is wife about whether her mother approves of him and if Nancy herself has lost confidenceThe launch proceeds without incident and the ship rendezvous with the space station. The head of the space station takes leaders of the expedition on a tour of the Mercury rocket that will fly to Mars. The briefing is interrupted by an emergency signal. North Hemis ship Typhoon commanded by Capt Tonunts. He is seeking permission to land at the station to conduct emergency repairs.Permission is granted and over dinner North and South Hem astronauts discuss how it is silly that the two hems cant exchange information or be allowed to work together. The commander of the station reveals details about the mission to Mars and shows them the Mercury.It turns out the North Hem astronauts are spies and are surprised to hear of the South Hemi expedition. Later Doctor Gordon talks to the scientist onboard the Typhoon. He realizes their ship is also equipped to go to Mars but the commander wont reveal further details. The Typhoon crew realizing the game is up and immediately launch from the space station despite the lack of confidence in their repairs. In response Mercury launches a few hours later and the race to Mars is on. The North Hem crew gets into trouble when they encounter a strong magnetic force that destabilizes the ships guidance system. They realize the ship is being dragged into the sunOnboard Mercury all systems are operating normally when they receive an emergency distress signal from Typhoon. Mercury can save the Typhoons crew but doing so will sacrifice the success of their own mission. Doctor Gordon doesnt hesitate and changes courses.On board Typhoon conditions get worse and the crew realizes they dont have much time. Their impetuous actions have sealed their fate. Moments from death they receive word Mercury is nearby and is going to affect a rescue. Typhoon warns them of the danger but Mercury wont be put off.On Earth the control center watches the drama unfold. Mercury continues on the rescue mission. Mathews crosses over to Typhoon and transfers the dying men to safety. As Mathews reaches his own ship Typhoon is destroyed.Gordon rechecks his figures and sees they can no longer reach Mars. Their only hope is to make for an asteroid and hope Earth sends a refueling ship.The ship successfully lands but unseen by the crew strange creatures are moving around preparing to attack as expected Earth launches the fuel rocket. Gordon however realizes a directional antenna is going to have to be deployed to guide the ship inThe men forget their troubles as they watch a spellbinding image of Mars rise over the horizion. The North Hem men now understand how great a sacrifice the south hem astronauts actually made. Eventually the fuel rocket arrives but instead of a controlled landing it crashes and explodes. The crew faced with a lack of communication with Earth rig one of the ships antennas to flash a light in Earths direction to see if they can make contactOn Earth a dramatic decision is made to send a piloted fuel rocket to save the men. Concern is raised over the use of untested technology and astronaut Paul Clinton is selected to fly the ship. Paul agrees to man the flight and he launches without incidentBack on Mercury they continue to try and establish contact with Earth however they become more and more convinced they are going to die. However unannounced Pauls rocket arrives and he goes to make contact with the Mercury crewAs he journeys to the other ship he is set upon by an alien creature intent on eating him. Before he can react a second creature appears and attacks the first seemingly killing it and saving Clinton. From the Mercury they see Paul who suddenly collapses in some sort of distress.Clinton manages to tell them about the fuel rocket and briefly mentions the creatures that attacked him before dying. The Mercury crew is puzzled by Pauls cryptic reference to monsters but successfully fuel their ship any way and blast off for Earth.Sometime later the ship successfully lands on a specially prepared landing pad on a lake. The crew then transfer by boat to the shore to be reunited with their families"

"The introduction shows the young Dalai Lama receiving gifts from Tibetan monks. One gift he receives an ornate music box has special meaning to him as he is still a young child.The progress of Heinrich Harrer through India and Tibet on his trek across the high plateau to Lhasa is interwoven with the story of the young Dalai Lama growing into an 8 year old boy who becomes the spiritual leader of Tibet with a thirst for western knowledge and later into an adolescent. The Dalai Lama is portrayed by three different actors as he grows up.Harrer (Pitt) and his pregnant wife Ingrid (Ingeborga Dapkunaite) are briefly shown being driven to the train station in Graz for Harrer's departure on an expedition to Nanga Parbat. It becomes evident that Ingrid resents his departure. At the station Harrer barges through the crowds dragging his wife by the hand and shows his resentment of Peter Aufschnaiter's selection as leader of the expedition.Harrer at the train station in 1939 appears hostile to the Nazi Party taking their flag with reluctance. The real-life Heinrich Harrer admitted he had Nazi sympathies at the time which he later regretted. Harrer's arrogance and self-sufficiency become apparent as he sits by himself on the train journey to India.The expedition begins climbing the mountain Harrer Aufschnaiter and the expedition group begin climbing Nanga Parbat. Harrer falls injuring his leg but hides his injuries from the group. Harrer places Aufschnaiter's life in danger by his inability to pull him safely up a cliff due to the pain of his injury; this worsens their relationship. After an avalanche Aufschnaiter orders the group to retreat back to the base despite Harrer's determination to reach the summit.While descending from the mountain Harrer encounters a Tibetan traveller who gives him a photograph of the Dalai Lama for his protection. On reaching the base they learn that Germany has invaded Poland and they are arrested by the British and taken by truck to Dehra Dun prison camp. Harrer writes to Ingrid in Austria telling of his capture; she responds with divorce papers and tells him she wishes to re-marry. Harrer's son Rolf is now two. Harrer makes several unsuccessful escape attempts. Eventually Aufschnaiter manages to steal a British uniform and several of the prisoners escape. The members of the group go separate ways with Harrer heading for northern India.On reaching northern India in 1943 Harrer steals food from a religious offering but is later violently sick from food poisoning. The rest of the group apart from Aufschnaiter have been recaptured. Aufschnaiter plans to travel to China to find work.They cross the border into Tibet and set out east but are met by two men on horseback who tell them they must turn back. Aufschnaiter attempts to speak to them in Tibetan which he learned while in prison but is told that foreigners are strictly forbidden in Tibet. On reaching the next town and requesting food they are confronted by the same two men. They learn that one of them is the garpon leader of the province and that the reason that foreigners are forbidden from Tibet is that there is a threat of attack from outside forces. Harrer attempts to appease the garpon by offering him the photo of the Dalai Lama but they are forced to return towards India escorted by two guards who are told to shoot them if they try to escape.Harrer and Aufschnaiter are escorted to a small town near the border with India where they trade what little they have in return for food. Harrer persuades Aufschnaiter to trade a watch that he received from his father for climbing Mont Blanc. Seeing one of the guards trying on a Chinese army uniform he offers him his ""German army boots"" while actually giving him crampons. The guard takes a liking to the ""boots"" and puts them on. Harrer and Aufschnaiter escape to the mountainside where the guards clad in the heavy crampons and uniforms are unable to follow.While recovering from the escape Aufschnaiter discovers that Harrer has deceived him about not having a watch to trade and is furious at Harrer's selfishness. Harrer first indifferent after a while begs forgiveness offering Aufschnaiter all three of his watches and his wedding ring. Aufschnaiter declines the ring but Harrer insists stating ""I didn't deserve it either."" The two then start on their way over the high Tibetan plateau to Lhasa.The arduous journey to Lhasa (including footage secretly captured by director Jean Jacques Annaud in Tibet) causes Harrer to reflect on his son Rolf and the Tibetan custom that the longer and more difficult the journey in a pilgrimage the greater the repentance of past sins. High in the Himalayas Harrer and Aufschnaiter are abducted by bandits but they escape on horseback. Harrer and Aufschnaiter are forced to kill their horses and eat the meat raw.In Lhasa the pair encounter pilgrims travelling to Lhasa. They are only allowed to join the group after saying they have ""special permission"" and showing one of the pilgrims the instruction sheet from their first aid kit. As the Tibetan they show it to cannot read English he allows the two men to join the pilgrims.In Lhasa Harrer and Aufschnaiter cover their faces to avoid recognition as foreigners. When they try to steal food Kungo Tsarong played by Mako seeing the condition of the travellers invites them to stay at his home.Tsarong asks for permission for the explorers to remain in Lhasa. The conversation is overheard by the secretary to the regent Ngawang Jigme (B. D. Wong). Jigme offers Harrer and Aufschnaiter a gift of new clothes and at the guest quarters of Tsarong's home a Tibetan tailor named Pema Lhaki arrives to measure the two men. Not having seen a woman for several years they immediately attempt to win her affections.Settled in Lhasa Harrer continues his attempts to impress Pema Lhaki by demonstrating his climbing techniques and showing a scrapbook containing his achievements back in Austria in skiing and his gold medal at the 1936 Winter Olympics. Lhaki is seemingly unimpressed stating that climbing is a foolish pleasure and informing Harrer that Western civilization is very different from Tibet where a man is more respected for abandoning his ego.Harrer still interested in the Tibetan tailor rips out a jacket pocket as an excuse to visit her and have it repaired. Harrer enters the store to find Aufschnaiter already there. The three go ice skating together and Harrer realises that Aufschnaiter has succeeded in winning the Tibetan woman's love.The foreigners have been observed through a telescope by the young Dalai Lama from the nearby Potala Palace. Ngawang Jigme visits the Chinese embassy in Tibet and becomes acquainted with the Chinese ambassador. He has been sent by the Tibetan government to persuade Chinese officials to stop sending financial gifts to Tibetan monasteries as they are becoming suspicious of Chinese intentions. The Chinese official hints that Jigme could gain advancement by offering his services to the Chinese.By May 1945 Harrer visits Aufschnaiter and Pema Lhaki to congratulate them on their marriage. They discuss the activities of the Chinese Communist Party. Lhaki asks Harrer about his life in Lhasa and he reveals he is very busy and moved out of Tsarong's house five months ago into his own settlement. But he has not found love and shows his resentment over Aufschnaiter's marriage.Returning to Lhasa where he has been hired to survey the city he is told by Ngawang Jigme that World War II is now over. Heinrich immediately begins packing for home when Kungo's elderly wife arrives with a letter for him from Austria. The letter is from his son Rolf telling him to stop writing. A depressed Harrer receives another letter this time from the `Great Mother` of the Dalai Lama.In a beautiful Deyangsar courtyard Harrer greets the Great Mother (played by Jetsun Pema the sister of the living 14th Dalai Lama). She gives him instructions on how to behave when in the presence of the Lama who has learned of Harrer's presence in Lhasa and would like to meet him personally.Harrer enters the interior halls of the Potala Palace. Turning into a dark chamber he sees the mysterious Dalai Lama seated on a throne at the end. Entering behind the Great Mother he bows repeatedly much to the amusement of the young Lama. Harrer walks up to the throne and the Dalai Lama plays with Harrer's mop of blond hair calling him a yellow head. Shortly afterwards the Dalai Lama asks the surprised Harrer if he can build him a movie cinema at the palace. He also wants Harrer to teach him about western civilization and become his private tutor during the building process.Harrer immediately begins building the theatre but encounters a problem as the workers refuse to harm the worms in the earth while digging believing that each could have been their mother or a loved one in a past life. Harrer again visits the Dalai Lama who emphasizes that religious concerns are paramount and that he must honor them and find a solution. As the movie house is built Harrer begins tutoring the boy in world geography and the ways of the west.Harrer and Aufschnaiter with a number of important monks and ministers attend a festival near a river where they meet Ngawang Jigme to celebrate his promotion to the position of minister. At a Christmas party Harrer returns Aufschnaiter's old watch. Harrer had come across it by chance at a shop and retrieved it as a gift to Aufschnaiter along with a note thanking him for his friendship. Soon afterwards a Tibetan turns on the radio and a Chinese announcer proclaims that they plan to invade Tibet. The party breaks up and an evil omen at night casts a shadow on what is to come.At a meeting with the cabinet the regent states that Tibet recognizes no foreign sovereign and banishes all Chinese officials from Tibet including those at the Chinese embassy. As the crisis grows the Dalai Lama has a terrible nightmare of Chinese atrocities near the Tibetan border in Taktser his birthplace with monasteries being burnt down and monks being forced to kill each other. He seeks comfort with Heinrich Harrer who tells him it was a dream only to find soon after that the Chinese have indeed crossed the Tibetan frontier burnt Taktser and are advancing.Three Chinese generals fly to Lhasa to speak with the Dalai Lama and against Harrer's request Ngawang Jigme raises the Chinese flag saying that Tibet should embrace the enemy if it cannot defend itself. Monks have spent many days creating a sand mandala to welcome the generals who show their disrespect by wiping their feet on it. Despite the Dalai Lama's speech to them that Tibet is a peace-loving nation the head of the Chinese delegation dismisses religion as ""poison"" and war soon breaks out on the Tibetan frontier at Chamdo.Ngawang Jigme is sent to Chamdo with a small Tibetan army to defend against the Chinese attack but many Tibetans are killed. Jigme makes the decision to surrender after just 11 days and then blows up the Tibetan ammunitions dump destroying any hope of a counter-attack. During a treaty signing in Lhasa Kungo Tsarong tells Harrer that if Jigme had not destroyed the weapons supply Tibetan guerillas could have held the mountain passes buying time to appeal to other nations for help. As the Chinese take control of Tibet and the Chinese flag flies at Lhasa Harrer visits Ngawang Jigme to condemn him for his surrender and insults him by returning the jacket he received as a gift.Despite the Chinese invasion the Dalai Lama now fifteen years old is formally enthroned as the spiritual and temporal leader of Tibet. Harrer pays a final visit to the Lama on top of the Potala and prays with him. As he leaves the palace he is given a gift of the music box which was shown to be so dear to the Dalai Lama at the beginning of the film.Harrer bids farewell to Aufschnaiter and Pema and returns to Austria in 1951 to visit his son Rolf now a young boy. Although his son initially refuses to see him Harrer leaves the musical box as a gift for him and watches him lovingly from the crack in the door. In the film finale Harrer gradually comes to know the son he has thought about all the years while he was in Tibet and trains him like himself in the art of climbing mountains. Having reached the top of a mountain Harrer is shown with a Tibetan flag planted beside him at the peak."

"MOBY DICKA man is seen walking along hilly terrain near the sea. When he walks nearer to the camera and we see his face in closeup we hear the words ""Call me Ishmael"" He is the narrator (Richard Basehart) a young man who has experience in the merchant marine but has recently decided to see a different world by signing on to a whaling ship. By nightfall he arrives at the Spouter Inn in New Bedford Massachusetts and agrees to share a bed with a then absent stranger. He enjoys drinks at the inn and as he waits for night he is told of the rules for seeking work on whaling ships by Stubb (Harry Andrews). He is questioned and after his answers are deemed satisfactory he is accepted by a group of seamen and he joins in drinking songs with them. During the storm they spot the mysterious Captain Ahab (Gregory Peck) walking in the rainWhen his room and bed mate a heavily tattooed Polynesian harpooner named Queequeg (Friedrich von Ledebur) returns very late and discovers Ishmael in the bed under the blankets both men are alarmed but the two quickly become close friends and decide to sail together on a whaling ship.The duo signs on with the Pequod a whaling ship that is soon to leave port. Two owner partners make the hiring decisions and negotiate the compensation which is a fraction of the profit from the voyage. They are suspicious of Queequeg but he shows his marksmanship with the harpoon and they gladly accept him at 1/300 fraction where Ishmael only gets 1/600. The ships captain Ahab is nowhere to be seen; nevertheless the owners speak of his solid reputation and legendary experience.On a church near the ships townspeople and seamen gather for a Sunday service. The pastor Father Mapple (Orson Welles) gives a sermon based on the story of Jonah and how after his earnest prayer he was saved from the great whale.The two pals encounter a man on the dock as they walk to board the Pequod a man seeming either crazed or drunk (Royal Dano) and he makes a prophecy that the day you smell land where there is no land that day Ahab will meet his death and after he will return and beckon others save one to follow him. When asked his name he answers ""Elijah"".The ships second rank officers direct the first part of the voyage while Ahab stays in his quarters. The chief mate is Starbuck (Leo Genn) a serious sincere Quaker and fine leader; second mate is Stubb happy-go-lucky cheerful and forever smoking his pipe; the third mate is Flask (Seamus Kelly) a thoroughly reliable man who bullies anyone bigger than him. Each mate is responsible for a whaling boat and each whaling boat of the Pequod has its own pagan harpooneer assigned to it.Some time after sailing Ahab finally appears on the quarter-deck one morning an imposing frightening figure whose haunted visage sends shivers over the narrator. One of his legs is missing from the knee down and has been replaced by a prosthesis fashioned from a whale's jawbone. A long vertical scar from his hairline down to his chin gives his face a special character.Ahab orders the crew to gather and in a rousing speech promises a Spanish ounce of gold to the crewman who first sights Moby Dick. His single secret purpose for the voyage is hunting down and killing Moby Dick an old very large sperm whale with a snow white hump and mottled skin that crippled Ahab on his last whaling voyage. The gold coin is nailed to a mast in plain view as a reminder.In a scene in the Captain's quarters Ahab explains to Starbuck that over the years he has gathered information on whale presence and migrations from many many whaling ships and he has fashioned a map that he can use to predict where the whales might be at any time of year. According to his map Moby Dick should be at Bikini Atoll by the following March.In another sequence a whale is sighted pursued in three small boats and harpooned. The whale swims away towing the boats and dives. One of the boats might be towed downwards into the deep so the rope is cut. The whale eventually weakens as it bleeds and it is killed. The carcass is cut into pieces the blubber sliced and the oil rendered in large vats on the vessel. At the end of the work the seamen celebrate.Eventually a day comes when Ishmael is given the opportunity to be the lookout from the top of the main mast. It isnt long before he sights a whale in fact a large group of whales. The whales are chased and five of them are killed. The seamen who will share in the profits from the value of the oil are happy.However Ahab hears from another passing ship that the white whale has been sighted. Immediately he orders a stop to the harvest work and full sailing in the direction that he believes Moby Dick is traveling much to the dismay of Stubb and the other seamen who are shocked that the profit from the whales killed is abandoned.Only Starbuck offers any resistance to the charismatic but obsessed captain. The first mate argues repeatedly that the ships purpose should be to hunt whales for their oil with luck returning home profitably safely and quickly but not to seek out and kill Moby Dick in particular and especially not for revenge as revenge is only for the Lord to take.Starbuck even dares to show to the other mates a book in which it is clearly written that if a Captain diverts resources to a private matter and neglects the commercial purpose of the enterprise the other officers are justified in removing the Captain from his duties. However Stubb and the other mates refuse to go along with even the planning of such an act. Eventually even Starbuck acquiesces to Ahab's will suppressing his instincts.The custom of visiting with other whaling vessels met in the open sea is illustrated when the Pequod meets the Samuel Enderby. Captain Boomer (James Robertson Justice) has lost an arm to the whale comes on board the Pequod for a friendly visit and interchange of news. For Ahab however there is but one relevant question to ask of another ship: Hast seen the White Whale? Captain Boomer is stunned at Ahab's burning need for revenge and soon ends their brief interchange.In another incident that emphasizes Ahabs obsession when a man accidentally falls off the ship from a great height he is unusually quick in making the decision that the man is dead and will not resurface. Ahab insists on resuming course without delay to the dismay of Stubb and the seamen.Another day Queequeg is throwing bone pieces on deck in what is evidently a fortune telling ritual. Suddenly he stares at his bones says Ah! and insists on calling the ships carpenter. He places an order for a very long coffin with special carvings a coffin that is to be pitched and caulked so as to be waterproof. He pays the carpenter gives the rest of his money his harpoon and other property to Ishmael and stops talking to anyone while just staring vacantly ahead.Queequeg persists in his catatonic state until much later. When a fight breaks out and Ishmael is in danger of being knifed to death Queequeg jumps out of his stupor to protect him and resumes his normal behavior.Next they meet the Rachel from which Moby Dick has been seen very recently. As a result of the encounter one of its boats is missing. The captains youngest son had been aboard. The Rachel's captain begs Ahab to aid in the search for the missing boat but Ahab is resolute; the Pequod is very near the White Whale now and Ahab will not stop to help. He reasons that he will kill the whale that killed the captains son and revenge should be the priority.The man at the mast sights the white whale and Captain Ahab organizes a ceremony where the man is handed his Spanish doubloon.In the next sequence the Pequod goes right into a dangerous storm as the captain refuses to take any course of evasion that would divert him away from Moby Dicks path. Despite extreme danger from strong winds the captain insists on leaving full canvas on even trying to replace a torn sail in the middle of the storm. Starbuck begs Ahab one final time to desist on his quest for vengeance but to no avail. As the ship leaves the storm area St. Elmos fire appears on the masts and Captain Ahab shows that he can dominate the elements by his will as he extinguishes the glow from a harpoon he is holding.The next day the Pequod meets Moby Dick. The Pequod's crew pursues the whale which wreaks widespread destruction. Ahab ignores Starbucks pleas one more time and continues with his ill fated chase. All three boats set out to harpoon him.Ahab harpoons the whale but the harpoon line breaks. Moby Dick then rams the Pequod itself which is heavily damaged. As Ahab harpoons the whale again the unfolding harpoon rope catches him and he is entangled with other ropes hanging from harpoons that have remained stuck into Moby Dick from previous encounters.Even stuck to Moby Dick Ahab stabs and stabs with all his energy trying to kill the whale while it thrashes about upending the other boats and diving deep into the sea. After Moby Dick returns to the surface the crew still on boats see the dead Ahab stuck on the side of the whale and one limp arm seems to wave beckoning even in death thus fulfilling the mysterious prophecy of Elijah.Moby Dick destroys all boats. As the seamen struggle to stay on the surface Moby Dick swims around and around the Pequod creating a whirlpool that catches the ship and draws it down slowly.Ishmael is on the surface still swimming when Queequegs special coffin bobs up from the deep. Ishmael is able to climb on top of the coffin and cling to it for a day and a half at which time the Rachel comes upon the scene and he is rescued.Only Ishmael has survived to tell the tale."

"In the middle of World War II two prisoners of war are burying a corpse in the graveyard of a Japanese POW camp in southern Burma. One American Navy Commander Shears (William Holden) is revealed to routinely bribe guards to ensure he is put on the sick list which allows him to avoid hard labour.A large contingent of British prisoners under the leadership of Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness) arrives defiantly whistling the Colonel Bogey March as they march in. Because they were ordered by their superiors to surrender Nicholson states that they should be obedient and cooperative prisoners. The Japanese camp commander Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) addresses them informing them of his rules. He insists that all prisoners regardless of rank will work on the construction of a bridge over the Kwai River as part of a railroad that will link all Burma.The next morning when Saito orders everyone including officers to work Nicholson commands his officers to stand fast. He points out that the Geneva Conventions state that captured officers are exempt from manual labour. Saito is infuriated and backhands Nicholson in the face but the latter refuses to back down even after Saito has a machine gun set up threatening to shoot all the officers. Saito is dissuaded from shooting by Major Clipton (James Donald) a British medical officer prisoner citing an inquiry and scandal should Saito carry through with the murder of officers. Instead the Japanese commander leaves Nicholson and his officers standing in the intense heat. As the day wears on one of them collapses from heat stroke but Nicholson and the rest are still standing defiantly at attention when the prisoners return from the day's work. After Colonel Nicholson is beaten in Saito's quarters the British officers are sent into a punishment cage and Nicholson into his own box for solitary confinement.When Clipton requests to be allowed to check the officers Saito agrees on the condition that Clipton persuade Nicholson to change his mind. Nicholson however refuses to budge saying ""if we give in now there'll be no end to it."" In the meantime construction of the railroad bridge falls far behind schedule due in part to many ""accidents"" purposely arranged by the British prisoners.Saito has a deadline; if he should fail to meet it it would bring him great shame and oblige him to commit seppuku (ritual suicide). Saito reluctantly releases Nicholson telling him that he has proclaimed an ""amnesty"" to commemorate the anniversary of Japan's great victory in the Russo-Japanese War using it as an excuse to exempt the officers from work. Upon their release Nicholson and his officers proudly walk through a jubilant reception. Saito for his part breaks down in tears in private.Having recovered from his ordeal physically but not mentally broken Nicholson sets off on an inspection of the bridge and is shocked to find disorganization shirking and outright sabotage on the construction site. He decides that he will build a better bridge than the Japanese soldiers. He orders Captain Reeves (Peter Williams) and Major Hughes (John Boxer) to come up with designs for a proper bridge despite its military value to the Japanese. He wants to demonstrate to his captors what he considers superior British ingenuity and to also keep his men busy which he feels would be better for morale than sitting around doing nothing in prison.Meanwhile three men one of them the American Shears attempt to escape. Two are killed; Shears is shot falls into the river and is swept downstream. After many days in the jungle he stumbles into a Siamese village whose residents help him recover and get back to safety. He's given food water and an outrigger boat to make his way down the river. Shears runs out of water during the trip and is forced to drink the water from the river which makes him ill. However he makes it to the mouth of the river and is picked up by British forces and shipped to a British hospital in Colombo Sri Lanka (at the time Ceylon). While recuperating he dallies with a lovely nurse (Ann Sears).Major Warden (Jack Hawkins) a member of the British Special Forces asks to speak with him. He informs Shears that he is leading a small group of commandos on a mission to destroy the Kwai bridge. He asks Shears to volunteer since he knows the area. Shears refuses finally admitting that he is not Commander Shears at all but a Navy enlisted man. Shears recounts that he and a Navy Commander survived the sinking of their ship but the Commander was subsequently killed by a Japanese patrol. ""Shears"" switched dog tags with the dead officer hoping to get preferential treatment in captivity. It didn't work but then he had no choice but to continue the impersonation. Warden tells him that the military already knew about it. To avoid bad publicity the U.S. Navy loans him to the British. Warden offers him a deal: in exchange for his services he will be given the ""simulated rank"" of major on the mission and avoid being charged with impersonating an officer an offense punishable by death. Thus Shears reluctantly ""volunteers"" with the understanding that should he survive he'll get to keep his officer status. They are to be joined by Lieutenant Joyce (Geoffrey Horne) a young eager officer with no combat experience who insists that he won't fold under pressure should he have to kill someone on the mission and a fourth officer.Back in the camp Nicholson explains to the Japanese through engineering principles that they've selected a poor site for the bridge. Finally convinced the original bridge is abandoned and construction of a whole new bridge is commenced 400 yards downriver. Clipton watches in bewilderment as Nicholson maniacally drives his men to complete the project by the deadline. Ironically he even volunteers his junior officers to assist with the physical labor something he had refused to consider earlier in the standoff with Saito - provided that the Japanese officers are willing to pitch in as well.Meanwhile the commandos parachute in. The fourth officer dies due to a bad landing. The rest make their way to the river assisted by native Burmese women porters and their village chief Yai (M.R.B. Chakrabandhu). The commandos come upon a Japanese patrol whom they try to kill without firing shots but Joyce freezes when confronted by one in the jungle. Warden jumps in front of him and kills the Japanese soldier but gets shot in the foot as a consequence. This slows him down but Shears refuses to leave him behind and the trio make their way to the bridge with the Burmese helpers.As the prison camp celebrates the completion of the bridge on time with a party for all Shears and Joyce wire explosives to it under cover of darkness. The next day a Japanese train full of soldiers and important officials is scheduled to be the first to use the bridge; Warden wants to blow it up just as the train passes over accomplishing two missions at once.As dawn approaches the trio notice with horror that the river has receded and the wires and explosives that were hidden the night before are now exposed. Nicholson proudly walks up and down his bridge making a final inspection and notices the wires. The train can be heard approaching. Nicholson and Saito frantically hurry down to the riverbank pulling up and following the wire towards Joyce who is waiting by the detonator. When they get too close Joyce breaks cover and stabs Saito to death. Nicholson yells for help and then tries to stop Joyce (who cannot bring himself to kill Nicholson) from getting to the detonator. A firefight erupts as Warden fires upon the approaching Japanese soldiers; Yai is killed in the gunfight. When Joyce is hit Shears swims across the river to finish the job but he too is shot just before he reaches Nicholson.Recognizing Shears Nicholson suddenly comes to his senses and exclaims ""What have I done?"" Warden desperately turns the mortar fire in their direction killing Shears in the blast and mortally wounding Nicholson. The colonel stumbles over to the detonator plunger and falls on it with his dying breath just in time to blow up the bridge and send the train hurtling into the river.Warden feeling guilty for killing Shears and Nicholson in the face of shocked stares from the Burmese women pleads ""I had to do it! They might have been taken alive! It was the only thing to do!"" Meanwhile Major Clipton the British medical officer who has witnessed all the carnage unfold from his vantage point on the hill shakes his head incredulously ""Madness! ... Madness!""."
After settling his differences with a Japanese P.O.W. camp commander a British colonel co-operates to oversee his men's construction of a railway bridge for their captors while oblivious to a plan by the Allies to destroy it.::Chris White
This movie deals with the situation of British prisoners of war during World War II who are ordered to build a bridge to accommodate the Burma-Siam railway. Their instinct is to sabotage the bridge but under the leadership of Colonel Nicholson they are persuaded that the bridge should be constructed as a symbol of British morale spirit and dignity in adverse circumstances. At first the prisoners admire Nicholson when he bravely endures torture rather than compromise his principles for the benefit of the Japanese Commandant Saito. He is an honorable but arrogant man who is slowly revealed to be a deluded obsessive man. He convinces himself that the bridge is a monument to British character but actually is a monument to himself and his insistence on its construction becomes a subtle form of collaboration with the enemy. Unknown to him the Allies have sent a mission into the jungle led by Warden and an American Shears to blow up the bridge.::alfiehitchie
During World War II the Japanese have set up a P.O.W. camp in Indochina on an island on the banks of the River Kwai. The primary purpose of this location is so that the Japanese can use the labor of the P.O.W.s to construct a railway bridge over the river the bridge which will be a vital link for the Japanese forces in the war. It needs to be completed in five month's time. The camp is presided over by Colonel Saito a man ruled by a mixture of Japanese cultural tradition and the need to win the war at any cost even if it includes torture and other measures against the Geneva Convention. Among the officers at the camp are Colonel Nicholson the senior British officer for whom the principle of the matter is foremost regardless of the consequences; Major Clipton the pragmatic medical officer; and U.S. Navy Commander Shears who is more concerned about his own well-being and that of those around him than he is about the big picture of the war. Against the assertions of its futility by Saito and Nicholson three P.O.W.s try to escape among them being Shears with all being shot. Everyone believes Shears is dead but he manages to survive and make it out of the jungle back to safety. At the camp a battle of wills ensues between Nicholson and Saito specifically regarding the illegal use of P.O.W. officers as laborers to build the bridge. Nicholson wins the respect of the P.O.W.s because of this standoff. But Nicholson ultimately has other thoughts namely taking control of the building of a proper well-made bridge to replace the haphazard one currently being directed by Saito. Nicholson's rationale is that it will raise the morale of the P.O.W.s by giving them something constructive to do while demoralizing the enemy by showing them the superiority of the British. Meanwhile as Shears is convalescing at a beach-side military hospital in Ceylon he is certain he will get his wish of a medical discharge. His plans are disrailed when he is asked to participate in a British-led four man commando mission to destroy the bridge under the command of Major Warden the antithesis of Shears in that he can only see the big picture without seeing the personal cost to those around him. This offer is one that Shears cannot refuse. The four understand the risks the perils of the jungle and the Japanese but they may not fully realize that their biggest threat for carrying out the mission successfully is Nicholson's pride.::Huggo

"The film opens with Fredrick and Eleanor Little (Hugh Laurie and Geena Davis) and their son George (played by Jonathan Lipnicki) on the day they are intending an adoption. George wants to go to the orphanage with them but has to go to school. While George is at school the Littles go to the orphanage where among all the kids there they fall in love with a thoughtful observant mouse named Stuart (voiced by Michael J. Fox) who knows almost everything about the other children having been at the orphanage for a long time. Despite the warnings of Mrs. Keeper (the woman in charge) who says that humans should not be adopting mice the Littles decide to adopt him as their second son.Immediately after getting home Stuart meets Snowbell (voiced by Nathan Lane) the family cat who immediately attempts to eat Stuart. George arrives home and is surprised when his parents introduce Stuart as his new brother. George at first thinks it is a joke but is shocked when he realises they are being serious. That night Snowbell visits Stuart and requests that he keep a low profile so as to avoid getting seen by the other cats and damaging Snowbell's image (the alley cats would laugh forever if they heard that there was a mouse with a pet cat).George is at first sullen and somewhat disappointed and treats Stuart with contempt. He eventually snaps at a family gathering when they encourage him to play ""catch"" with Stuart. Stuart also earns Snowbell's wrath when his friend Monty the Mouth (voiced by Steve Zahn) visits for food. As Snowbell tries to keep him from seeing Stuart Stuart makes a scene trying to get a cereal box from a cupboard. When he sees him and discovers he is a member of the family Monty cannot contain himself. Enraged Snowbell tries to kill Stuart who narrowly escapes by fleeing into the basement. Here Stuart learns that George keeps a playroom and the two interact and eventually George comes to accept Stuart as his brother. Stuart also finds that George keeps a toy car just his size. They decide to work together to finish George's homemade model boat the Wasp for the Central Park Boat Race the following week.Snowbell however isn't finished. He and Monty head to an alley that night to visit Smokey (voiced by Chazz Palminteri) a Mafia Don-like Russian Blue who is the leader of the alley cats. Since Snowbell doesn't want Stuart killed he makes a plan with the alley cats to remove Stuart from the Little house. On the day of the 92nd annual Central Park boat race the Wasp is finished and they arrive at Central Park. But George finds a problem when he discovers his nemesis Anton is present at the race. At the same time Stuart accidentally destroys George's remote control rendering his boat inoperable. To make up for this Stuart takes control of the boat himself. Anton however attempts to cheat by ramming his much larger boat into other boats and sinking them. When he attempts to do the same thing to Stuart's boat Stuart manages to bite into the line of his sail rendering Anton's boat inoperable. Stuart subsequently wins the race.The celebration is short lived however as during the party that night the Littles are visited by Reginald and Camille Stout (voiced by both Bruno Kirby and Jennifer Tilly) a mouse couple claiming to be Stuart's parents. After discussion Stuart reluctantly leaves with his real parents taking the small car with him as a goodbye present from George and they go to their home a small toy castle on a golf course. Three days later the Littles are visited by Mrs. Keeper whom they had asked to do a little background research on Stuart. She tells them that according to the records Stuart's parents died several years ago after a pile of canned food fell on them. The Little's realised that Stuart had been kidnapped and call the police.A terrified Snowbell rushes to the alley and warns Smokey and the others about the Littles' discovery. Smokey then decides that the only way to rectify things is to kill him. They call a meeting with Reginald and demand that he and Camille hand Stuart over. But the Stouts having grown to care for Stuart reveal the truth and Reginald orders him to escape before the cats find him. Stuart does so after saying goodbye to his ""fake parents"". Meanwhile the Littles decide to place ""missing"" posters around the city to get help in finding Stuart. While going through Central Park Stuart is ambushed by Smokey and a few cats. He manages to evade them by driving his car into the sewer but at a cost: he loses the car and his luggage while escaping the storm drain. Eventually Stuart finds his way home just as the Littles leave to hang the posters. The only one home is Snowbell and he tells Stuart a lie about how the Littles are enjoying life without him and shows him the family picture with Stuart's face cut out (the Littles had actually removed the picture to provide one for the Missing posters). Stuart leaves again. However Snowbell sees the pain Stuart's absence has caused and realises his selfishness.Discovering Stuart's location from Monty and the other cats who intend to eat Stuart Snowbell heads to Central Park and finds him sitting alone in a bird's nest. Snowbell however turns on the other cats and escapes with Stuart admitting his lie to him and that the family actually does love him he is in fact the only one who hates him. The cats catch up with them and Snowbell attempts to convince Smokey to call off the hit on Stuart but is refused. Instead Smokey orders the cats to kill both Stuart and Snowbell. Stuart responds by taking off Snowbell's collar and using it to lure the cats.The cats give chase and eventually corner Stuart hanging from a tree branch. The cats group together on a lower branch to catch Stuart but Snowbell breaks it at the last minute and sends the cats into the water below. Smokey sneaks up behind Snowbell and is about to kill him when Stuart releases a thin branch that hits Smokey in the face and knocks him into the water. Enraged and humiliated Smokey walks off only to be killed by dogs upon turning a corner. Monty and the other cats also climb out of the water whimpering and embarrassed. Snowbell and Stuart walk home and Stuart shares a warm reunion with his family telling them that Snowbell helped him home. The Littles bring Stuart and Snowbell inside and close the windows ready for bed."

"***This synopsis has errors and timeframe issues. I'm in the process of correcting those and giving more detail to it much of which I've already done. This is my favorite Bogart movie of all and with all due respect to the original writer I'm not completely re-writing it but simply organizing it sequentially. I will have it completed in the next few days as time allows me.***Harry Morgan (Humphrey Bogart) and his sidekick Eddie (Walter Brennan) run a charter fishing boat in Martinique (controlled by the French government at Vichy which in turn was Nazi-controlled after 1940). Their current client is an American fisherman named Johnson who grudgingly pulls out money to pay for gasoline for the boat and who then ineptly loses two large marlins by not following Harry's orders. The second loss also includes all the tackle he was using. He tells Harry he is leaving Martinique in the morning and will pay him after he goes to the bank in the morning because he doesn't have enough money on him.Back at the hotel Gerard (Frenchy) who is the hotel owner and a member of the Free French resistance comes to Harry's room and asks him to take on a smuggling job for the Free French Resistance movement. Suddenly a sultry young woman (Lauren Bacall) appears in his doorway asking for a match. Harry tosses her a box of matches and she leaves. Harry asks Frenchy who she is and he says she came that afternoon on the plane from the south. Harry tells Frenchy he doesn't want any part of the movement or their activities.Later in the dining room he notices Marie with his American client who acts too fresh for her taste. She brushes him off and goes to stand by the piano where Cricket (Hoagy Carmichael) is playing and singing ""Am I Blue?"" She joins him in the verse and they harmonize well. Harry sees Marie pick up Johnson's wallet and leave the room. Frenchy stops at Harry's table and tells him he hasn't been able to head off the men who want to hire Harry's boat for the smuggling operation and Harry tells him he'd better head them off. Harry follows Marie upstairs and stops her as she's entering her own room and makes her come with him into his room. He makes her hand over the wallet and finds it's full of traveller's checks and cash enough to pay his bill along with a plane reservation for earlier the next morning than Johnson had said he'd meet Harry to pay him. Harry is glad Slim (as he calls her) took the wallet and didn't return it after all. She says she needed money to leave Martinique.Frenchy comes to the door with his group of comrades who offer to pay Harry to pick up two people secretly from another Caribbean island and bring them back to Martinique. Eddie comes in during this business and asks the French resistance leader if he was ever stung by a dead bee. The man tries to shut Eddie up but Slim takes up the question seriously delighting Eddie and getting Harry's approval. Eddie leaves with a coin for a drink. Harry refuses to get involved despite their pleadings. He leaves the room taking Slim downstairs with him to confront Johnson and return his wallet and ask for the payment Johnson owes Harry. As Johnson is about to sign over the traveller's checks the pro-Nazi French police open fire in the lounge at the resistance group that had come down from Harry's room and Johnson gets killed by a stray bullet.Capt. M. Renard (Dan Seymour) the head of the local Gestapo closes the hotel lounge and picks out four people for questioning--Frenchy Harry and Slim being three of the four. At the station they confiscate Harry's money and passport and question everyone. Harry gets riled at the methods of questioning and fights back then grabs Slim and tells her ""Let's get out of here"" which they do.Harry and Slim end up going to another bar but they realize neither has any money so Slim asks Harry if she should do her thing and he says ""Go right ahead."" She immediately turns on the flirtatious charm with a French officer there and he gets up and starts dancing with her. Harry leaves grinning. He knows she's ""good"" at what she does but it begins to bother him.Later she comes to his room with a bottle she has presumably charmed out of the man she was with but Harry's reaction makes her feel cheap and she leaves angry. He follows her across the hall to her room and they have it out. They have their first kiss then another and as she's leaving his room she tells him to whistle if he needs anything. ""You know how to whistle don't you Steve? You just put your lips together and . . . blow."" She shuts the door and he lets out a low wolf whistle.His American client dead without paying him the rest of his money confiscated by the police having refused Slim's last few dollars Harry reluctantly takes the smuggling job. He's supposed to pick up the two Frenchmen from another island and deliver them back to Martinique in the middle of the night. He makes them pay him in advance and he arranges a plane ticket for Slim for that afternoon to fly back to her home.Harry doesn't want to take Eddie with him into danger so he insults and slaps Eddie to keep him on shore while he goes out to pick up the Frenchmen. Eddie tricks him and smuggles himself aboard. Eddie comes out of hiding and confronts Harry telling him he knew it was all a lie. Together they pick up their cargo which turns out to be a man and his wife Paul and Hellene de Bursac (Walter Molnar and Dolores Moran). On the way back to Martinique they encounter a patrol boat and the Frenchman takes one in the shoulder. Harry shoots out the patrol boat's spotlight and they head back to their destination in the foggy night waters.Harry and Eddie get the Frenchman and his wife back to Martinique. They find that Slim intentionally missed the plane home and has been hired to sing with Cricket and his combo. She helps Harry remove the bullet from de Bursac's shoulder while his wife makes demands and has hysterics and finally faints. Slim keeps her cool but is pointedly jealous of Madam de Bursac's flirting with Harry and Harry's obvious response to her.Captain Renard tries to get Eddie drunk to find out where the Frenchman and his wife are. Harry intervenes and breaks up the questioning. It turns out that de Bursac is actually supposed to get a resistance leader off Devil's Island to help the cause and he wishes he had Harry's courage. Soon afterward Captain Renard again gets hold of Eddie and tries to blackmail Harry into giving over the location of the Frenchman by threatening to withhold liquor from Eddie to make him go into delirium tremens and crack up. Harry gets a gun from his desk drawer and shoots one of Renard's henchmen and handcuffs the other and Renard. He beats them both until they agree to make the arrangements so that the de Bursacs Harry Eddie and Slim can all leave the island for good.With everything fixed up they gather in the hotel lounge where Slim wins over Eddie when she asks him ""Was you ever stung by a dead bee?"" Eddie says she's all right and she goes over to say goodbye to Cricket who's playing piano. He asks her if she's happy and Slim says ""What do you think?"" doing a dance back over to her ""Steve."""

"Captain Nolan (Richard Harris) is an Irish Canadian fisherman who catches marine animals and sells them in order to pay off the mortgage of his boat so he can return to Ireland. Nolan's crew is looking for a great white shark for a local aquarium but a scientist named Ken (Robert Carradine) is being targeted by the shark. An orca killer whale comes and kills the shark subsequently saving Ken. This switches Nolan's target to the orca. While Nolan is on the journey with his crew he tries to capture what he believes to be a bull orca but mistakenly harpoons a pregnant female. Nolan and his crew get the orca on board where she subsequently miscarries. The crew hoses the dead fetus overboard as the male looks on screaming.Seeking release of his near-dead mate the male orca tries to sink the ship. One of Nolan's crew members Novak (Keenan Wynn) cuts the female off the ship but the male leaps and drags him into the sea eating him alive. The following day the orca pushes his now dead mate onto shore. Alan Swain (Scott Walker) berates Nolan on his actions after finding the dead whale. Nolan denies responsibility but Swain and the villagers eventually find out his involvement. The villagers insist that he kill the orca as its presence is causing the fish vital to the village's economy to migrate. The orca then terrorizes the village by sinking fishing boats in broad daylight and then breaking fuel lines thus destroying the village's fuel reserves and causing a massive fire.Dr. Rachel Bedford (Charlotte Rampling) a colleague of Ken and whale expert shows him how similar whales are to humans and tells Nolan that ""If he (the orca) is like a human what he wants isn't necessarily what he should have."" Nolan confesses to Rachel that he empathises with the whale as his own wife and unborn child had previously been killed in a car crash caused by a drunk driver. Nolan promises Rachel not to fight the whale but the orca attacks his sea-front house containing an injured crew member of Nolan's Annie (Bo Derek) within it. The house starts slipping into the sea and the whale bites Annie's leg off. Nolan decides to fight the orca although with Novak dead and Annie maimed for life Nolan and Paul (Peter Hooten) are now the only crew members left. Dr. Bedford and Ken join the pursuit along with a native American man Jacob Umilak (Will Sampson) enlisted for his orca knowledge.The crew begins to chase the whale after it signals Nolan to follow him. Ken is leaning over the side when the whale surfaces and grabs him eating him alive in the process. They follow the whale until they reach the Strait of Belle Isle though when Paul starts to get into a lifeboat the maddened orca knocks Paul out of the boat and drowns him.The next day the whale shoves an iceberg into the boat and starts to sink it. Nolan manages to harpoon the whale just before he and Dr. Bedford escape from the boat while Umilak is crushed beneath an avalanche of ice just after sending out an SOS.Nolan and Dr. Bedford hide in an iceberg although Nolan slips onto another. The orca separates the icebergs trapping Nolan. The whale jumps onto the ice causing it to tilt and send Nolan into the water. The whale lifts Nolan up with his tail and throws him onto another iceberg killing him. Dr. Bedford looks on as the dead Nolan slips into the water in a cross shape. With his revenge complete the whale swims southward under the ice while a helicopter is seen to rescue Dr. Bedford.

"The film is set in British South Africa in the province of Natal in January 1879. The first half of the film revolves around the administrators and officials of Cape Colony notably the supremely arrogant Lord Chelmsford (Peter O'Toole) and the scheming Sir Henry Bartle Frere (John Mills) who both wish to crush the neighbouring Zulu Empire which is perceived as a threat to Cape Colony's emerging industrial economy. Bartle Frere issues an impossible ultimatum to the Zulu king Cetshwayo (Simon Sabela) demanding that he dissolve the Zulu Empire. Cetshwayo refuses providing Cape Colony with a pretext to invade Zululand. Despite objections from leading members of Cape Colony's high society and from Great Britain itself Bartle Frere authorises Lord Chelmsford to lead a British invasion force into Zululand.The second half of the film focuses on the British invasion of Zululand and the lead-up to the climatic Battle of Isandlwana. The invading British army laden with an immense network of supply wagons invades Zululand and marches in the direction of Ulundi the Zulu capital. British forces eager to fight a large battle in which they can unleash their cutting-edge firearm military technology against the vast Zulu army become increasingly frustrated as the main Zulu army refuses to attack the British and fighting is restricted to a few small skirmishes between British and Zulu scouts.Concerned that their supply lines are becoming overstretched and that the main Zulu army is still at large British troops begin torturing captive Zulu warriors in an effort to learn the location and tactics of the Zulu army. Halfway to Ulundi Chelmsford halts his army at the base of Mount Isandhlwana ignoring the advice of Boer attendants to entrench the camp and laager the supply wagons leaving the camp dangerously exposed. During the night Colonel Durnford (Burt Lancaster) and an escort of 50 mounted Basutos approach the camp. Lord Chelmsford then orders Durnford to return to his unit bringing them to the camp immediately to reinforce Colonel Pulleine (Denholm Elliott). Lt. Vereker (Simon Ward) should join Durnford as aide-de-camp.Reacting to false intelligence Chelmsford leads half of the British army including the best infantry cavalry and artillery units on a wild goose chase far from the camp in pursuit of a phantom Zulu army. On the day of battle (January 22) Durnford and his troops are arriving at 11:00 a.m. at the camp at Isandlwana. Meanwhile the Zulu captives escape their torturers and regroup with the Zulu army informing them of the British army's direction and strength. After having lunch with Colonel Pulleine and Lt. Vereker Durnford quickly decides to send Vereker to scout the hills. Durnford then decides to take his own command out from the camp too and scout the iNyoni heights.The entire Zulu army is later discovered by men of Lt. Vereker's troop of scouts who chase a number of Zulu herdsmen trying to hurry away their cattle only to discover the main Zulu enemy force of thousands at the bottom of a valley. Lt. Vereker then sends Lt. Raw to warn the camp that it is about to be attacked.As Zulu impis descend upon the camp Durnford's cavalry retreat to a donga in an effort to hold back the Zulu advance. Forced back the British take heavy casualties including the battery of Congreve rockets which is overrun by the Zulus. Initially the British infantry succeed in defending the camp and Zulu forces retreat under a hail of artillery and small arms fire. British units defending the camp are now becoming dangerously spread-out and are oblivious to Zulu forces moving round the sides of the mountain in an encircling move.As British infantrymen begin to run out of ammunition and the British cavalry are driven back towards the camp Zulu warriors charge the British troops en masse sustaining horrific casualties but succeed in breaking the British lines. As British troops break and flee towards the camp the battle breaks down into hand-to-hand fighting between British soldiers and Zulu warriors amongst the débris of tents fallen soldiers and supply wagons. Overwhelmed by the sheer number of Zulu warriors British soldiers and their African allies are slaughtered in the camp some being cut down as they attempt to flee back towards Natal. Colour-Sergeant-Major Williams (Bob Hoskins) sees many of his redcoated men being cut down by Zulu spears. Williams is stabbed in the back by a spear while attempting to save the life of one of his young soldiers and having killed several Zulu soldiers with his bayonet after he runs out of ammo dies at the hands of a large band of Zulus.As the British forces break apart the one-armed Durnford becomes trapped in the camp. Hoping to save his men Durnford orders his African cavalrymen to retreat. Remaining on foot at the battlefield Durnford is killed alongside his infantrymen.During the last minutes of the battle Colonel Pulleine entrusts the Queen's Colours of the 2nd battalion 24th Regiment of Foot to two junior officers Lts. Melvill (James Sebastian Faulkner) and Coghill (Christopher Cazenove) who attempt to carry them to safety in Natal passing gruesome scenes as Zulu warriors hunt down British and African infantrymen attempting to flee across the river. While crossing the Buffalo River the three lieutenants are cut down by Zulus. Coghill accompanies Melvill in his attempt to gallop the Union Flag back towards Natal. When Melvill nearly drowns while trying to cross the Buffalo River Coghill turns to help him and is ambushed by Zulu warriors. Coghill attempts to defend himself with his revolver but is killed. Melvill is assegaied by Zulu warriors while defending the flag.The Colours (a Union Flag embroidered with the Regiment's insignia) are captured. In his dying moments Vereker shoots and kills the Zulu wielding the Colours and the Colours fall gracefully into the river where they are carried out of reach. Vereker's fate remains unknown (though it is implied that he too gets killed).Seeing the battle lost Pulleine returns to his tent to pen a last letter to his wife. He is discovered by one of the escaped Zulu prisoners and unwilling to kill the young soldier the elderly Pulleine allows himself to be killed in his tent by the Zulu and other warriors that storm in.In the evening Chelmsford and the rest of the British army return to Isandlwana to be greeted by the sight of their slaughtered comrades and the news that a mass Zulu army has invaded Natal and laid siege to Rorke's Drift. Charles L. Norris-Newman (Ronald Lacey) a war correspondent for 'The Standard' also views the devastation (having accompanyed Chelmsford's expecition and so avoid the battle/massacre. The film ends with Zulu warriors in a silhouetted victory procession dragging captured British artillery back to Ulundi.

A dramatization of the Battle of Isandlwana where the British Army met its match against the Zulu nation.::Kenneth Chisholm <kchishol@rogers.com>
In 1879 South Africa the administrators of the British Cape Colony have designs to eliminate the Zulus as a hindrance to their colonial economy. To that end the British present King Cetshwayo with an impossible ultimatum to provoke a war they are sure they can win easily with their rifles and artillery against native spears. However that war proves more difficult than the arrogant British commander Lord Chelmsford expects as his overburdened army fruitlessly searches for the elusive enemy. However in the shadow of a hill called Isandlwana the overconfident British army learns to its sorrow just how badly they have underestimated the tactical skill and might of the Zulu nation.::Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com)

"In the opening scene we are introduced to the nomadic warrior/outlaw Deathstalker (Richard Hill) who fights a smarmy treasure hunter who has taken a beautiful maiden captive and is chased by a group of Barbarian warriors. Deathstalker dispatches the Barbarians as well as the treasure hunter who attempts to rape the girl. Deathstalker tries to comfort the girl hoping that she will respond to his subtle nature but she runs away.Deathstalker is sent by a witch on a quest to find a chalice an amulet and a sword two of which are held by the wicked sorcerer Munkar (Bernard Erhard). Deathstalker finds the sword almost immediately which has been hidden by the witch in a cave guarded by an ogre and an imp. The imp Salmaron reveals himself to be a thief cursed by the witch and aids Deathstalker in defeating the ogre. Deathstalker removes the curse from Salmaron and the thief agrees to accompany Deathstalker on his journey. Sword in hand Deathstalker sets out to Munkar's castle to gain the remaining objects of power.On his journey Deathstalker meets a charming fellow warrior dressed in midriff-baring armor who introduces himself as Oghris (Richard Brooker). Oghris tells Deathstalker about a tournament that he is traveling to and invites Deathstalker to tag along with him. Oghris explains that Munkar has invited warriors from across the land to participate in contests until a winner is determined - the winner will inherit Munkar's kingdom. One night along the way to the tournament the pair meet Kaira a female warrior (Lana Clarkson) who wears only a G-string and a cloak. Later that night Deathstalker removes Kaira's skimpy outfit and has passionate sex with her. She joins the group on their journey the next morning.Munkar reveals to his assistant that his true agenda is for the warriors to fight each other to the death until only a weakened survivor remains for Munkar to kill. This would remove all threats to his rule. Arriving at Munkar's castle Deathstalker Oghris Kaira and the other participants gather in Munkar's banquet room the night before the tournament. The warriors are invited to get drunk and rape Munkar's harem slaves including Princess Codille (Barbi Benton). Oghris connects with one slave girl while Kaira keeps Deathstalker to herself.

The thief is knocked into a well that leads to Munkar's harem. It is revealed that Oghris brought Deathstalker to the tournament expressly for Munkar and he is ordered to kill him. Reluctant to kill his friend Oghris warns Deathstalker and asks the hero to just leave the tournament but Deathstalker refuses and attacks him. During the brawl Oghris has the chance to draw the sword and kill Deathstalker but chooses to fight fairly and ultimately loses. Deathstalker says goodbye to the fighter and kills him.The last day of the tournament arrives and there are only two competitors left - Deathstalker and an ogre. After a long fight Deathstalker kills the ogre and moves to claim his prize. He is attacked by Munkar's men but makes his way to the amulet. Salmaron is discovered in the harem room but frees the women and helps them slay the guards. Deathstalker defeats the holder of the amulet and faces Munkar; he is able to defeat the sorcerer's illusions and claims the third object of power.

"On April 5 1941(one day before the German army occupied Yugoslavia in the WWII) men on a country road board Krstic's bus for Belgrade: two Gypsies who occasionally sing about misery (occasionally predicting indirectly what shall happen next) an aging war vet (presenting a stubborn veteran who survived proudly two wars before the WWII) an educated methodical intellectual (who is sympathizing German power which is known for their superior sense for order and efficiency in contradiction to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia mentality which is as he wants to say: chaotic not well emancipated and inefficient) a dapper wannabe singer (traveling to attend an audition for singers) a consumptive a hunter with a shotgun (who shows himself as very unintelligent and clumsy).
Krstic is a world-weary cynic out for a buck and always calculated; the driver is his son the simple cheerful Misko (who represents an post-adolescent enthusiastic hungry for life). En route they pick up a priest and young newlyweds going to the seaside. Along the way mis-adventure strikes: a flat tire a rickety bridge a farmer who's plowed the road a funeral two feuding families an army detail and a lost wallet slow the bus and expose rifts among the travelers.

"Stanley Yelnats IV (Shia LaBeouf) is a good-hearted teenager born to a luckless family that has been cursed for generations. The luckiest of the Yelnats ancestors Stanley Yelnats I (Allan Kolman) lost his fortune when outlaw ""Kissin' Kate"" Barlow stole his treasure chest. The Yelnatses blame their Latvian ancestor Elya Yelnats (Damien Luvara) who was cursed after breaking a promise to carry Madame Zeroni (Eartha Kitt) up a mountain.Stanley is wrongfully arrested and tried for stealing a pair of baseball shoes that Clyde ""Sweet feet"" Livingston (Rick Fox) a famous baseball player had donated to charity. Stanley is sent to Camp Green Lake a juvenile work camp for his alleged crime. He arrives to find that the ""camp"" is a dried-up lake run by the corrupt Warden Walker (Sigourney Weaver) her assistant Mr. Sir (Jon Voight) and camp counselor Dr. Pendanski (Tim Blake Nelson). Each day the detainees must dig a hole 5 ft deep and 5 ft in diameter to ""build character"" despite the danger of the desert sun rattlesnakes and yellow-spotted lizards which can kill with a single bite. The children are told that if they find anything interesting they may earn a day off. The inmates known by their nicknames include Zero (who refuses to speak to anyone but likes to dig holes) Armpit Zig-Zag Squid X-Ray and Magnet. Stanley is slowly accepted into the group and is given the name ""Caveman."" He soon creates a friendship with Zero (Khleo Thomas) whose real name is Hector Zeroni while teaching him to read.A flashback shows how the men of the Yelnats family suffer under a bad luck curse that affects all aspects of their lives. Stanley II tells Stanley IV the story of how it all started with his great-great grandfather Elya Yelnats in Latvia. Elya worked for Morris Menke (Ravil Isyanov) shoveling manure out of his barn. Elya thought Menke's daughter Myra (Sanya Mateyas) was very beautiful. He goes to a fortune teller Madame Zeroni for advice about his destiny. Madame Zeroni recommends that he go to America where her son has gone and that his future should be there instead of with Myra who is empty-headed. Elya asks Menke for permission to marry his daughter but Menke says that Igor (Ken Davitian) who is eating with him has offered her his fattest pig (Igor is fat too). To prove her point about Myra Madame Zeroni advises Elya to take a young pig and carry it up the mountain every day so that as the pig grows he will get stronger. Further he should sing the pig a certain song when it drinks water from the stream. She tells him that after the pig is full grown and he gives it to Menke Elya must carry her up the mountain and sing while she drinks so that she will regain her strength. She gives him a warning though that if he forgets to perform that last task she will curse him and his generations to eternity. Elya gives the pig to Menke and Menke allows his daughter to choose who she wants to marry. She is indecisive. In anger Elya tells her to go ahead and marry Igor. He takes Madame Zeroni's advice and heads to America but forgets to carry her up the mountain as she ordered him to do if he wants to be spared the curse. He realizes that he has just made the biggest mistake of his life.Another flashback which reveals how the modern story comes together relates the history of Camp Green Lake. The town was once a thriving lake town with plenty of water and life. Miss Katherine (Patricia Arquette) the schoolteacher is accosted by a rich landowner Warden Walker's ancestor Trout Walker (Scott Plank). He proposes to her but she rejects him. Miss Katherine is in love with the onion seller Sam (Dulé Hill) an African American who helps repair her schoolhouse in exchange for her renowned spiced peaches. Among other things Sam claims that regularly consuming onions and 'onion juice' will keep the local yellow-spotted lizards away. When Sam kisses Miss Katherine the townspeople burn the school. Sam attempts to escape in his boat the Mary Lou but Trout kills Sam. In retaliation Kate kills the sheriff (Eric Pierpoint) who refused to help Sam. She leaves a lipstick kiss on his forehead beginning her life as the outlaw ""Kissin' Kate"" who kisses the men she kills.Back in the present Stanley finds a tube of lipstick that belonged to Kissin' Kate Barlow (Miss Katherine) but he gives it to X-ray because X-ray hasn't had a day off in six months. X-ray gets an entire day off for the tube. Then Armpit tries to pass off a stove knob as something he dug up but the Warden knows better and Armpit's joke costs him a week of no shower privileges.After Dr. Pendanski insults Hector he retaliates by hitting him with his shovel and runs away. After some deliberation Stanley sets out to help Hector and finds him taking shelter under the remains of Sam's boat the Mary Lou. Zero now stranded in the desert offers Stanley the last jar of ""sploosh"" (an old jar of Miss Katherine's spiced peaches which had been left on the boat). Stanley knowing they can't survive in the desert for much longer heads over to a mountain called God's Thumb.Meanwhile Walker decides to presume Hector is dead and deletes his files. Stanley carries Hector up the mountain where they find a field of onions and a source of water helping them regain strength for several days. Unknowingly Stanley breaks the family curse because Hector Zeroni happens to be a descendant of Madame Zeroni. When he carries Hector to the top of the mountain sings to him and lets him drink from the stream that runs uphill he fulfills the promise made by Elya centuries earlier. After Hector wakes up he reveals he is the reason Stanley was sent to Camp Green Lake. Hector tells Stanley he had been homeless and had been at the shelter where many things (including Sweetfeet's shoes) had been donated. Because he did not know the shoes were famous he took the shoes and walked off with them. He then heard sirens coming; thinking they were after him Hector took off the shoes and tossed them over the bridge where they fell on Stanley's head. This is how Stanley was caught with the shoes and sent to Camp Green Lake. Stanley thinks it is destiny that they met.In a flashback Kate Barlow now older is found in the middle of the now dried-up lake by a pair of husband-and-wife bounty hunters: one of her former students along with Trout Walker (whom the student has married). They mention that the lake dried up because it hasn't rained since Sam died. They order Kate to hand over the Yelnats treasure but she tells them that they ""can dig for a hundred years and will never find it."" Kate allows herself to be bitten by a yellow-spotted lizard on the arm; she suffers for a while and soon dies.As Stanley breaks his family curse his father finally finds the solution to an odor-eliminating mixture that he has been trying all his life to create -- the addition of peaches and onions. Stanley and Zero decide to go back to Camp Green Lake to investigate the hole in which Stanley found the tube of lipstick feeling lucky all of a sudden. They dig deeper into the hole and uncover a chest. Warden Walker and Mr. Sir discover them and attempt to take the chest away from Stanley and Zero until they notice that yellow-spotted lizards have climbed onto the boys.When the group is discovered the next morning by the assistant attorney general (Ray Baker) and Stanley's lawyer Carla Morengo (Roma Maffia) Walker attempts to explain that the chest is hers at which point Stanley jumps out of the hole to confront her with Hector behind him. They are still alive due to the fact that yellow-spotted lizards are averse to the onions they had been eating. Hector reveals that ""Stanley Yelnats"" is written on the front of the chest.Back at camp the lawyer finds out that there are no files on Hector. One of the cops notices that Mr. Sir (who was revealed to be Marion Sevillo) has a gun which is a violation of his parole. When Warden Walker states that she had no knowledge of this Mr. Sir blurts that Dr. Pedanski isn't a real therapist. The assistant attorney general then declares Camp Greenlake under his jurisdiction as Marion Warden Walker and Dr. Pendanski are arrested. As Stanley is beginning to leave rain falls on Camp Green Lake. Walker Marion and Dr. Pendanski are shocked -- it hasn't rained at Green Lake in years. Walker asks Stanley to show her inside the chest but Stanley refuses. Stanley then drives home with Hector.The Yelnats family claims ownership of the chest and its contents. Stanley decides that half the money should go to Hector and Hector uses some of his share to hire private detectives to find his mother (Shirley Butler).Camp Green Lake is closed and all its juvenile inmates are sent home. Later it reopens as a girl scout camp. At the end an advertisement appears on TV for the odor-eliminating mixture Sploosh; the celebrity endorser is Clyde ""Sweet feet"" Livingston. Stanley Clyde and others watch."

"Atlanta businessmen Lewis (Burt Reynolds) Ed (Jon Voight) Bobby (Ned Beatty) and Drew (Ronny Cox) decide to canoe down the fictional Cahulawassee River in the remote Georgia wilderness expecting to have fun and see the glory of nature before the river valley is flooded over by the upcoming construction of a dam and lake. Lewis an experienced outdoors-man is the de facto leader. Ed is also a veteran of several trips but lacks Lewis' machismo. Bobby and Drew are canoeing novices.From the start it is clear the four are aliens in this unknown locale. The redneck locals are crude crass uneducated unsophisticated and unimpressed with the presence of outsiders. Drew briefly connects with a local mentally-challenged banjo-playing boy by joining him in an impromptu bluegrass jam (the 'Dueling Banjos'). But when the song ends the boy turns away without saying anything refusing Drew's handshake. The four ""city boys"" as they are called by one of the unfriendly locals exhibit a slightly condescending attitude toward the locals; Bobby in particular is patronizing toward them. Nevertheless Lewis manages to negotiate with a family of local mechanics to drive their vehicles to a town downriver where they will pick them up in three days. Afterwards the four get into their two canoes Lewis with Bobby and Ed with Drew and paddle off.The men spend the day canoeing down the river and encounter some rapids and rough water before camping by the riverside at night. Shortly before they retire for the night Lewis tells the others to be quiet and disappears into the dark woods to investigate a sound he heard. He returns a few minutes later and says that he didn't find anything. When asked whether he heard ""something or someone"" he tells them he doesn't know.The next morning Ed wakes first and heads into the woods with his hunting bow. He sees a deer but cannot keep his aim straight and kill the deer. He fires and misses. He returns as the others are finishing breakfast and loading the canoes. Lewis tells Ed to take Bobby and they get away first. Lewis says that he and Drew will catch up.After a while Bobby and Ed pull off to the side to wait and encounter a pair of unkempt hillbillies emerging from the woods; one toothless (Herbert 'Cowboy Coward) and one wielding a shotgun (Bill McKinney). Bobby speculates that they have a whiskey still hidden in the woods and amicably offers to buy some but the hillbillies immediately become angry and are not moved by Bobby's sarcastic comment. The two hillbillies tie Ed to a tree with his belt around his throat and force Bobby at gunpoint to strip naked. The lead hillbilly chases after and physically harasses Bobby as he tries to escape. Bobby's ear is twisted to bring him to his hands and knees and he is then ordered to ""squeal like a pig"". Ed is guarded by the toothless hillbilly helpless as the other hillbilly violently sodomizes Bobby.The second hillbilly comments on Ed's ""pretty mouth"" and releases Ed and tells him to get on his knees. Ed notices Lewis sneaking up behind them through the trees with an arrow drawn. Lewis shoots and kills Bobby's rapist with an arrow through his back as the toothless hillbilly is disarmed by Ed and quickly escapes into the woods. Lewis and Drew begin to argue with each other about whether to inform the authorities. While Drew wants to find a phone to call the police to report this Lewis argues that they all would be arrested and not receive a fair trial as he claims that the entire local hillbilly population are related to one another. They would be put on trial in a small town courthouse and that the judge and entire jury would be comprised of ""the dead man's friends and relatives"". Likewise Bobby does not want the story of his sodomy to become public. Lewis tells them that since the entire area will be flooded by a lake soon the body would never be found and that the escaped hillbilly could not possibly risk informing the police on them since he had participated in the assault. Lewis suggests a democratic vote and Ed and Bobby side with Lewis and the recommendation to bury the dead hillbilly's body and continue as though nothing had happened. During the grave digging Drew is obviously upset with the decision.After having buried the body the four make a run for it downriver. Soon disaster strikes as the canoes reach a dangerous stretch of rapids. In the lead canoe Ed repeatedly asks Drew to don his life jacket but an unnerved Drew ignores him without a word of explanation. As Drew and Ed reach the rapids a faint gunshot is heard and Drew falls forward into the river.After Drew disappears into the river Ed loses control of his canoe and both canoes collide on the rocks spilling Lewis Bobby and Ed into the river. Ed and Drew's wooden canoe breaks in half while Lewis and Bobby's metal canoe remains intact. The three tumble down the river through the rapids and a water fall. Lewis breaks his right femur and the two others are washed ashore alongside him in a gorge under a massive cliff. The badly-injured Lewis believes the toothless hillbilly shot Drew and is now stalking them.Later that night under cover of darkness Ed climbs the nearby rock face in order to dispatch the suspected shooter using his bow while Bobby stays behind to look after Lewis. Ed reaches the top and hides out until the next morning when he sees a man standing on the cliff holding a rifle looking down into the gorge where Lewis and Bobby are hiding. The man appears to be the hillbilly that escaped through the woods.Ed a champion archer who earlier lost his nerve while aiming at a deer again freezes in spite of his clear shot. The man notices Ed and fires his rifle as Ed clumsily releases his arrow. Ed falls to the ground in a panic and accidentally stabs himself with another of his arrows. The man stumbles toward Ed and is about to kill him when he drops his rifle and collapses revealing Ed's arrow sticking through his back (Ed had in fact hit him after all). Ed suddenly remembers that the hillbilly who tried to assault him had no front teeth but upon initial examination this man appears to have all his teeth but upon closer examination Ed discovers that his victim has a partial movable plate for his front teeth.Ed lowers the dead body down the cliff with a rope and climbs down after it. His rope breaks and he and the dead body fall into the river. Ed swims ashore and meets with Bobby and Lewis. Ed asks more than once if Bobby is certain the dead man is the same toothless hillbilly as the one they confronted earlier. Clearly irritated and not completely sure himself Ed snaps at Bobby and asks him to confirm the dead man's identity. Bobby does not answer.Ed and Bobby weigh the dead hillbilly down with stones and drop him into the river and then set out with the injured Lewis in the surviving canoe. A little later they come upon Drew's grotesquely-contorted corpse stuck on a dead-fall in the river. After being unable to find any definite gunshot wound on the dead Drew (save for a deep gash on his forehead which may or may not be a graze from a bullet) they also weigh the body down with rocks and release it into the river. Ed points out that they don't want the authorities examining Drew's body and possibly discovering a gunshot wound. Ed gives a short eulogy and sinks Drew into the river to ensure that he will never be found. With Lewis injured and Drew dead Ed becomes the leader trying to ensure their story is consistent knowing the authorities will investigate.After canoeing through more rapids Ed Bobby and Lewis finally reach their destination the town of Aintry which will soon be submerged by the river and is currently being evacuated. They call the police and take the injured Lewis to the local hospital while Sheriff Bullard (played by the author James Dickie himself) arrives to investigate the incident. One of the deputies Arthur Queen has a missing brother-in-law (ostensibly one of the hillbillies Lewis and Ed killed) and is highly suspicious of the ""city boys"" version of events. Ed and Bobby visit Lewis' hospital room to make sure Lewis' version of events is consistent with theirs. While they are uncertain whether the apparently unconscious Lewis understands them as the doctors enter Lewis appears to awaken gives Ed and Bobby a knowing wink and says he remembers nothing. Ed and Bobby then spend the night at a local boarding house and have an uneventful dinner with the local tenants who tell them that they are leaving town soon because of the dam-lake project.Another day or two later Ed and Bobby pack up their vehicles outside the boarding house and they prepare to pick Lewis up from the hospital and drive home. Just then Sheriff Bullard suddenly appears and asks Ed why there were four life jackets found in the canoe when only he Lewis and Bobby came out of the river. Stammering Bobby suggests there may have been an extra one. But Ed intervenes and says 'no' that Drew was not wearing his life jacket when he fell into the river and he does not know why. The sheriff also tells them that his men found the remains of one of the canoes above the last set of rapids where the guys claim that Drew drowned plus no trace of Drew's body has been found along the river. Ed continues to feign ignorance claiming not to know anything as well as claiming not to have seen anyone else in the area.While the Sheriff remains suspicious but having no evidence as to what did happen he simply tells Ed: ""Don't ever do nothing' like this again. Don't ever come back up here. I don't ever wanna see you or your friends again! I'd kinda like to see this town die peaceful"" to which Ed readily agrees and drives away with Bobby.The men vow to keep their story a secret for the rest of their lives. In the final scene Ed awakes screaming from a nightmare in which a dead man's hand rises from the lake."
