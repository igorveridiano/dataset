"David Aames (Tom Cruise) drives to work he finds the streets of New York strangely deserted at rush hour. With growing unease he drives to Times Square and finds the entire city abandoned. He then awakens in his bedroom once again to realize he's only been having a vivid dream.Cut to: David in a jail cell describing a dream to Dr. Curtis McCabe (Kurt Russell) a psychologist who has been assigned to him. David has been charged with a murder he cannot remember and he wears a mysterious pale mask. He and Dr. McCabe discuss the events that led to his eventual incarceration. Following the death of David's father he was given 51% ownership of his father's publishing company. The rest of the company is owned by a board of directors that David disparagingly calls the ""Seven Dwarfs."" Each of them believed that he was next in line to take over the company after David's father died. David can have anything his heart desires and nothing is beyond him.On the night of his birthday party which also includes a conversation with a drunken Thomas Tipp (Timothy Spall) the company attorney and an old friend of David's father David considered firing Thomas for what he believes is his incompetence as an attorney but he has a change of heart when Thomas makes a sad confession.David's best friend Brian Shelby (Jason Lee) brings with him a girl named Sofia Serrano (Penelope Cruz) whom he just met at the library. Almost instantly David and Sofia flirt with each other almost completely ignoring Brian. However Julianna Gianni (Cameron Diaz) a regular bed partner for whom David has no deep feelings crashes his party. She stays distant but keeps a close eye on him the entire night. Once David realizes Julianna is there he asks Sofia to pretend to engage in a deep conversation with him so that Julianna won't come near him. David and Sofia end up hitting it off. David walks Sofia back to her place where they stay up all night talking.The next morning as David is getting ready to drive to work Julianna drives up beside him asking how his night with Sofia was. Julianna makes David feel guilty about ignoring her and convinces him to get into her car. It quickly becomes apparent that she is obsessed with David. She starts driving recklessly speeding through busy city streets all the while insisting that she's deeply in love with him and berating him for treating her so casually. Fearing for their safety he tries to get her to stop the car by telling her that he loves her. She drives the car off a bridge in an attempt to kill them both.Julianna did not survive the crash. David did however although his face and right arm are mangled and he suffers blinding headaches due to the metal pieces holding his skull together. He spends a long time in isolation before deciding to take back control of his company and see Sofia again. She appears hesitant to be around him and when they go on a date she brings Brian along. The date is a disaster as David drinks too much and makes Sofia increasingly uneasy around him. The three part ways at the end of the night and David ends up passing out on a sidewalk. It is morning when Sofia wakes him up at that same exact spot and tells him that she will stay with him if he can get his act together. From that moment on David's life is turned around. His team of plastic surgeons is able to restore his face and he finds his soul mate in Sofia.David's new-found happiness is short-lived however when he begins hallucinating. He looks in the mirror to see his face once again disfigured. A mysterious man (Noah Taylor) turns up wherever he goes and tells David that he has the power to control the world. And one night he goes to bed with Sofia and wakes up to find himself with Julianna who insists she really is Sofia. He grows violent convinced that Julianna is alive and playing games with him. He is arrested and told by Tipp that he severely beat Sofia but Tipp will have the case thrown out. Tipp shows David photos of Julianna with a bruised face but everybody including his best friend Brian tells him that it was Sofia he attacked.David breaks into Sofia's apartment and finds that every photo he'd seen of Sofia is now of Julianna. Julianna attacks him thinking he's an intruder but then apologizes while still insisting she is Sofia. She leaves the room and the actual Sofia returns in her place as if nothing unusual had happened. They begin to make love but while they are in the middle of the act he finds that he is making love to Julianna. In a fit of panic he suffocates her and then discovers he has just killed Sofia.When David is finished telling Dr. McCabe his story he still can't bring himself to believe that he killed anybody. Dr. McCabe frustrated by David's failure to tell him anything meaningful that might help his case tells him that he can no longer help David and will try to argue for ""temporary derangement"". This odd turn of legalistic phrase is just one of many clues that in this version of David's world all is not what it seems. As Dr. McCabe leaves David sees an infomercial for a cryonics company called ""Life Extension."" This infomercial involving a dog that has been frozen and brought back to life has appeared at several points throughout the film. David is entranced by the commercial and McCabe sees that there may be a connection between Life Extension and David's amnesia.Escorted by Dr. McCabe and the police David visits Life Extension and realizes that he had signed on as a client. He had opted for an extra feature called the Lucid Dream. This allows cryogenically-frozen clinically dead clients to experience an unending custom-made dream life with no memory of their physical death.David realizes that he is now living in the Lucid Dream and that the mysterious man is his ""Technical Support."" The Support Technician explains that the Lucid Dream was ""spliced"" into his memories at the point where he passed out on the sidewalk after his night out with Sofia and Brian. But the dream went awry and turned into a nightmare. Since nothing he experienced after the splice was real David realizes that he never murdered anybody. Dr. McCabe tells him that the guilt he felt for the way he treated Julianna may have caused his subconscious to merge Julianna and Sofia. But it turns out that Dr. McCabe isn't real either; he's just a character David created in his dream to be the father figure he always wanted. Most curious is the fact that Dr. McCabe seems to believe that he himself is real and only reluctantly comes to accept the truth (he had previously mentioned that he was going out with his two daughters for dinner after a session with David but when The Support Technician asks him ""What are their [your daughters'] names Dr. McCabe has no response). Tech Support tells David that in reality he never saw Sofia again and that Thomas Tipp the attorney that David considered firing in the beginning had saved the company for David and helped him regain control from the board of directors. But David suffering constant pain and depression following his disfigurement committed suicide.In the end technical support reveals an upgrade to the software which allows David to either be reinserted into the lucid dream with no memory of the nightmare portion or to be awakened in the present time (which is 150 years after he was frozen) and live in the real world with a restored body. David chooses to be awakened in this future present realizing that everyone he ever knew will be long dead and his wealth will be worth far less. After one last lucid-dream rooftop exchange with Sofia in which she vows to ""find you again"" he leaps off the skyscraper. Multiple memory-images cascade frenetically through his mind as he falls. The final shot is of a brief whiteout (rather than the blackout) accompanied by the sound of a woman's voice telling him to ""open your eyes"" and an extreme closeup of a single human eye opening and staring into the camera.

After minutes of arguing she finally enters through the gates of Hill House where at the door she finds Mr. Dudley's wife Mrs. Dudley. As Nell makes her way to her room it's clear that she's instantly drawn to the house. Moments later Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones) arrives and gives Nell with an awkward homophobic reaction. After the two get to know each other a little better they both go downstairs and explore and find the carousel room then they return to the main entrance and meet Luke (Owen Wilson) Dr. Marrow and his two assistants Mary and Todd.

that all meet the batty flier's M.O. Morrison again asks Dees to take the
assignment. This time Dees agrees. Needless to say Katherine isn't
pleased. Dees has his own airplane and decides to run the killer's back
trail.First stop is the Cumberland County Airport in Falmouth Maine where
Claire Bowie was killed. Dees gets the details from
Ezra Hannon [John Bennes] on how as
he was turning over the night shift to Claire the night-flying Skymaster
landed. Out of the airplane walked a man wearing a long black cloak. The
next morning Hannon found Claire washing down the Skymaster. The morning
after that Claire was found with his throat ripped open. The only strange
thing that Hannon can recall was under the luggage bay--a big pile of dirt
filled with worms and maggots. That night Dees pays a visit to Claire's
grave in order to get a photograph. Later after drinking 3/4ths of a
bottle of booze and bedding down for the night at the Cumberland Motel
Dees dreams that someone wearing a long black cloak is after him. When
Dees looks out the patio door however he sees written on the glass in
what looks like blood ""STAY AWAY."" Dees chalks it up to a cemetery
caretaker who gave him a hard time while he was trying to photograph
Claire Bowie's grave.Second stop is New York the Alderton Funeral Home where Buck
Kendall is laid out ready for the funeral director to sew up the deep
gashes in his face and the two big holes on opposite sides of his neck. In
a call that evening to Morrison Dees learns that Morrison is getting
antsy. He wants to run the story about the Night Flier but Dees is not
ready to give it yet so Morrison has a brainstorm. He puts Katherine back
on the story.Third stop for Dees is Duffrey Maine where Ray and Ellen Sarch were
the Night Flier's third and fourth victims. Unfortunately the Duffrey
airport is closed so Dees has to land at Washington National rent a car
and drive into town. On the way he comes upon a car crash. Several people
have been killed and are laying all bloodied on the pavement and in their
cars. While photographing a young boy Dees sees the boy's face suddenly
change into that of an older man with a chain hanging out of his mouth.
Dees is taken aback but the policeman telling him not to get in the way
interrupts his vision. Dees stops at a gas station in Duffrey. The owner tells him how he
filled Ray and Ellen's tank the day before the murders. Ray was looking
tired and pale but Ellen was looking ""fine."" The owner suggests that Dees
talk to Selida McCammon Ellen's hairdresser. Selida tells Dees that she
thought it odd for Ellen after 20 years of appointments as regular as
clockword to suddenly come in two weeks early. Plus Ellen seemed all
dreamy to Selida looking ""like a schoolgirl with a crush"" and asking for
a new look that made her appear sensuous and younger. Ellen also told
Selida about the pilot who had flown in the night before and how they
welcomed him by inviting him in for dinner and to watch a little TV.
After getting the story from the local deputy Dees pays a visit to
the Sarches' trailer. He sees Ray's office where bloody handprints still
remain on the window. He sees the corner of the room where Ray's head was
found ripped from his shoulders. He sees on the wall the FAA warning for
a black Skymaster 337 #N101BL registered to Dwight Renfield. He sees the
bedroom where Ellen Sarch's body was found lying on the bed two big holes
on opposites sides of her neck her body bloodless and a peaceful smile
on her face. When he leaves the trailer Dees is chased by a large dark
dog who disappears when Dees manages to outrun it to his car.That evening after checking in at the Falling Star Motel Dees goes
out for a drink or two or three. As he looks at the photos he has taken
the bartender sets down an unordered Bloody Mary supposedly ordered for
Dees by a guy at the end of the bar but there is no one there now. Dees
lifts the drink to see the words ""STOP NOW"" printed on the napkin
underneath it. When Dees returns to his hotel who should he see there but Katherine
Blair. They trade insults boast about their leads and both admit that
they're actually dry. Dees invites ""Jimmy"" to help him phone airports in
search of the Night Flier's next touchdown. They make a list of all the
airports in the area and divide it in half. Dees calls his half on his
cellphone while Katherine calls her half on the phone in the motel room.
No luck. Only one airport to go--Wilmington--which is unlikely as it's a
large airport. Dees makes the call anyway. When he asks the air controller
if he's seen a black Cessna Skymaster 337 tail 101BL the controller
curtly says ""No"" and hangs up on him. Obviously the real answer is ""Yes.""Fourth stop is Wilmington Airport but first Dees has to get rid of
""Jimmy."" He locks her in his closet tells her ""Sorry Jimmy. You lose""
and then takes off alone. It is a dark and stormy night as Dees approaches
Wilmington. He asks the controller again if he's seen a Skymaster 337
tail 101BL but gets no reply. Suddenly his radio is filled with screams.
Then comes a deep gravelly voice calling his name. It is Dwight Renfield
himself. He tells Dees to turn around but Dees refuses. When he lands at
Wilmington Dees sees it--the black Skymaster. There is no one inside so
Dees peeks in. What he finds is mind-numbing. The cockpit is dripping with
blood and the cargo hold is filled with dirt worms maggots and several
copies of Inside View.Suddenly the screaming starts again and Dees runs to the terminal.
What he finds inside is even more appalling. Blood everywhere and bodies
of men women and children on the floor and in the chairs. Even the FAA
warning for the black Skymaster 337 #N101BL registered to Dwight Renfield
is dripping with blood. One body catches his eye and Dees goes over to
photograph it. It is a man with a chain hanging out of his mouth. Dees
pulls out the chain to find a crucifix dangling from it.Dees has had it. He can no longer hide behind his camera and races to
the men's room where he upchucks his dinner. Suddenly someone else enters
the men's room but Dees cannot see anyone in the mirror only the trickle
of blood in the urinal where someone is relieving himself. It is Dwight Renfield [Michael H. Moss]
and for the first time Dees realizes that he has encountered a real
vampire. Dwight makes Dees destroy his film warns Dees for the final time
not to follow him anymore and leaves. After shivering for a few seconds
Dees follows anyway...shouting at Dwight to show his face. Show it he
does to reveal two huge opposing fangs one on the top and one on the
bottom. Dwight then slits his own wrist and makes Dees drink the blood.And now Dees enters his own personal hell. The floor of the terminal
turns misty and from it start rising all the people whom Dees has
exploited to write his stories in Inside View. As they advance toward
him Dees freaks. Grabbing the axe from the emergency firebox he starts
hacking at them. Suddenly the police arrive followed by Katherine Blair.
The police order Dees to freeze but he rushes towards Katherine anyway
so they shoot him. They warn Katherine to stay back so she stands by the
terminal window where she sees Dwight Renfield getting into his black
Skymaster and taking off.Katherine knows that she can never print what she believes or believe
what she prints so the next cover of Inside View features Richard Dees
lying in a pool of his own blood. The headline reads: NIGHT FLIER
DEFANGED. Inside View Scribe Moonlighted as Dastardly Deadly Count. In
the lower right-hand corner is a photo of Katherine ""Jimmy"" Blair the
tabloid's new ace reporter.Sorry Dees. You lose. [Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl.]"

"The film opens with a woman running down a corridor. A murderous and unseen man follows closely behind. The hapless woman falls victim to the unseen man who kills her and walks away with bloodied hands.The film switches to a man falling from an electrical power line pole. In his fall the maintenance man releases the power line that he was attempting to attach. The cable is intercepted by a passerby named Cronin Mitchell but before he can clear himself of the high voltage wire it ominously thrusts into his face. Mitchell falls helplessly to the ground. An ambulance arrives where the paramedics discover that the maintenance man is dead but that Mitchell is still alive but in horrible pain. They place him on a stretcher and take him away in the ambulance.In the next scene bathed in a colorful psychedelic light show Mitchell tosses and turns frantically in his hospital bed. Two doctors named Dr. Roxin and Dr. White examine him and it is discovered that Cronin Mitchell due to this near-fatal electrical charge through his brain has somehow given him Extra Sensory Perception. The two medical colleagues discuss Mitchell's horribly disfigured face and his apparent lack of will to live. One of the doctors Dr. Roxin convinces Mitchell's doctor White that his ESP is real due to a series of ESP test cards.After the disfigured Mitchell sexually harasses a local nurse who tends to him she rebuffs his advances because of his scared face and tells him that ""a freak like you should have died!"" After leaving the hospital Mitchell retreats from the public and dons a black scarf and dark sunglasses to hide his ugly appearance. Having lost his job and everything else he begins giving private psychic readings out of his house for cheap prices. During a reading a book titled 'Bible of the Witches' magically appears in his hands. Almost at once an ugly hag of a woman enters and questions him about his psychic powers. Revealed to be a witch the ugly hag makes Mitchell a proposition: in return for using her magic powers to restore his face to as it once was Mitchell must agree to be her lover and slave. Mitchell agrees and his face is instantly returned to its normal state and the hag disappears.Without delay Mitchell leaves his house for the first time in months since his accident and begins to explore his renewed and enhanced life. In a dive bar Mitchell encounters the beautiful Ellen Parker. But to his curiosity Mitchell cannot read Ellen's mind. They retire to her apartment for some alone make-out time. Suddenly without warning Ellen transforms into the the ugly hag and reveals herself and orders him to keep his end of their deal. Mitchell very reluctantly submits to his slave status with this ugly witch.Meanwhile another young woman is murdered by an unseen man. The newspapers report that this is the seventh murder in the past month. The police contact Mitchell and invite him to the small town of Jefferson Wisconsin to help solve this latest murder by using his ESP.In Washington DC Dr. Alex Jordan karate-practicing playboy and psychic expert is sent to Jefferson to verify that Mitchell is not a hoax and to offer his professional assistance in apprehending the prolific serial killer. Detective Maddox of the Jefferson police force meets with Dr. Jordan and takes him to see Mitchell and his assistant Ellen who is now accompanying Mitchell wherever he goes. Jordan is immediately smitten by the beautiful Ellen but only Mitchell still sees her as an old hag whereas everyone else sees Ellen as a beautiful young woman. During the meeting to help find the elusive killer Dr. Jordan suddenly produces a small container from his coat pocket and explains that it contains the hallucinogenic drug LSD. He advises Mitchell to take the drug and to meet with him the next day. Mitchell explains that he has no experience with the drug but that he will under the circumstances do as he is asked.At a party Mitchell is asked to demonstrate his extraordinary powers. He does so by levitating a chair to the amazement of the onlookers. The next scene is in a church where Mitchell summons a ghost that has mysteriously laid claim to the unfortunate house of worship. The apparition appears touches Mitchell and leaves. Mitchell states to the priest of the church that the ghost will not return for ""she"" only needed contact with humankind.Meanwhile Jordan is pursing Ellen to seduce her but she rebuffs all his advances by claiming that she belongs to Mitchell and he is her one and only lover. Ellen further explains that she and Mitchell are meant to be together until death. Jordan then attacks her in a moment of misogynist rage but she fights him off. In an act of revenge Ellen tells Mitchell what happened and insists that he kill Dr. Jordan before he can try to force himself on her again. But Mitchell refuses to kill Jordan by conventional means and decides an alternative. During one evening Jordan retires to his hotel room bed alone and in a truly bizarre scene is beset by his blue bed sheets. However Jordan resorts to karate chopping and ripping the living blankets and escapes unscathed.At the climax Mitchell finally takes the LSD and during his ""trip"" (which is bathed in red light) he discovers that Detective Maddox is the serial killer. Somehow Mitchell also surmises that the murderous and corrupt police detective intents to shoot him. Maddox does appear to kill Mitchell and shoots him right between the eyes. Jordan and the police arrive too late to help out but kill Maddox as well. Despite Mitchell being dead the case is solved with Dr. Jordan taking all the credit for finding the killer which he decides to make the move onto Ellen.In the final scene Jordan is with Ellen in his parked car making the moves on her. Ellen responds to his advances by kissing him in return. But just like Mitchell earlier she suddenly transforms into the ugly witch hag. In horror Jordan runs out of the car and flees from the grotesque Ellen/Hag. Jordon unwittingly runs head-on into a fire flare at an excavation site and falls to the ground with part of his face horribly burned. The hag approaches him and offers to heal his injuries and restore his scared face with magic if he agrees to become her lover. Jordan agrees... and the vicious cycle is to continue all over again."

"The story begins with a young girl Kristen Parker creating a papier Mache model of 1428 Elm Street. The house originally inhabited by Nancy and Jesse from the preceding Nightmare on Elm Street movies has been haunting her dreams. As she works Kristen blasts loud music eats coffee from the jar and swigs Cola in an attempt to stay awake.Kristen's mother bursts in annoyed that her daughter is still awake and reveals that Kristen has been seeing a therapist for her nightmares. Mum is accompanied by a guy she has met and is in a hurry to return to him. She tucks Kristen in and goes downstairs leaving Kristen to fall asleep.Kristen awakes in her dream to find her bed is in front of the Elm street house. Children play outside singing the infamous ""Freddy"" rhyme as they jump rope. A little girl on a red tricycle waits on the porch of the house as Kristen approaches cautiously. Kristen speaks to the little girl. We hear Freddy's blades scrape and the little girl turns and rides inside. Kristen follows her pleading with her not to go in to the house.""This is where he takes us!"" the little girl announces as a boiler bursts into life. ""Freddy's Home!!"" Kristen grabs the girl and rushes towards the door becoming trapped as the floor melts. Freddy chases her as she runs round the corner into hanging bodies. ""Put me down you're hurting me!"" the little girl asks. Kristen looks down to see that she is clutching a dead and rotting body. She screams and ""wakes"" in her bed.Kristen goes to the bathroom unsettled by her nightmare. She goes to turn on the tap but it turns into a hand grapping her and holding her in place before she sees the image of Freddy Krueger appear in the mirror. The second tap also turns into a hand with tiny blades at the end like Freddy's claw. Freddy slices across Kristen's wrist her screams finally bringing her mum. As Kristen's mum bursts into the bathroom Kristen wakes properly to find herself clutching a razorblade blood oozing from her wrist and passes out.The next scene takes us to Weston Hills psychiatric hospital. Max the orderly and Dr. Gordon discuss a rash of teen suicides which have swept the area. They meet Taryn a girl not sleeping and Jennifer a girl who has been self-harming putting cigarettes out on her arms. He looks in on another boy in solitary for his violent outbursts. Dr Simms approaches and they talk about a new member of staff who has just left grad school but has been making lots of progress with ""pattern nightmares."" Dr. Gordon is not keen on someone using ""his kids"" to further their own career.At that moment an emergency message asks for both doctors to go to the examination rooms. Screaming can be heard as Elaine Parker discusses with a nurse her daughters attention seeking behaviour. As the doctors enter the room we see Kristen fighting and screaming hysterically as doctors try to sedate her. She grabs a scalpel begins to recite the rhyme: ""1 2 Freddy's coming for you 3 4 Better lock you door 5 6 Grab your crucifix 7 8 Better stay up late 9 10.... Never go to sleep again."" She can't bring herself to speak the last line. Someone completes the last line ""Never sleep again"" and everyone turns to see Nancy standing in the doorway. Nancy walks in and calmly takes the scalpel from Kristen before pulling her into a hug.Nancy asks Dr. Gordon about the kids who all suffer from sleep disorders including insomnia narcolepsy and bed-wetting but all have nightmares in common. He believes they share a ""group delusion"" of a boogey man which scares them so much they will do anything not to sleep. He elaborates with the story of a young boy who used razor blades to cut off his own eyelids to stop him sleeping. He praises her dealing with Kristen and she reveals that she has had some experience with pattern nightmares. As she leaves she drops her handbag and we see that Nancy is taking medication. He recommends she speak to Max and watches her leave. As he turns Dr. Gordon sees a nun dressed all in white who seems to then disappear.Max shows Nancy to an office she can use and introduces her to some of the patients. First is Phillip nicknamed the Walker because he sleep walks and who makes puppets. He shares a room with Kincade the boy who was in solitary. Max jokes that Nancy should memorize his face as Kincade spends so much time in solitary she won't see much of him. Another patient Joey leaves his room to help a young nurse pick up towels which has fallen from her trolley.Kristens mother Elaine and Nancy meet at their house to discuss her nightmares. Elaine is very dismissive believing Kristen is just acting out and looking for attention. She tells Nancy she has packed a suitcase of Kristens belongings and directs Nancy to her room to get them. Nancy sees the model of her old house which Kristen had been working on.Dr. Gordon looks up Hypnocil the medication he had seen in Nancy's bag to find that the drug is used to treat night terrors. We return to Kristen who is in bed drawing the Elm Street house. As she begins to doze the door to her room creaks open and a red tricycle wheels in before melting on the floor. She edges out of the room and finds herself back in the house. A stale barbequed pig with an apple in its mouth is on the table and flies buzz around before it leaps out at her.Kristen explores as a lump appears under the carpet and gashes in the walls. A huge snake with Freddy's face bursts out of the floor and begins to eat it's way up Kristen's body. She screams for Nancy and we see Nancy startled from her sleep. She looks at Kristen's model which she has taken home with her and hears Kristen scream again. Nancy passes out and falls through the chair to find herself in Kristen's dream. Nancy grabs a shard of broken mirror and stabs it into the eye of the snake causing it to drop Kristen.""YOU!"" Freddy hisses. Unable to believe it Nancy grabs Kristen and begs her to run. They hide behind a door and Nancy tells Kristen to get them back out. They disappear as Freddy crashes through the door and Nancy awakes back in her chair with a cut on her hand from the mirror.The next morning Nancy brings the model to Kristen telling her it is where she used to live. She asks if she has ever pulled anyone into her dream the way she did. Kristen confides that when she was a child she would pull her Dad into her dreams if they were scary allowing him to believe that they were his dreams instead. After her parents divorced it stopped and after a while Kristen thought she had simply imagined the whole thing. Kristen asks about the man in her dreams and Nancy assures her ""he is real.""At group Dr. Gordon tells the kids that it is ""straight talk only"" and then he and Dr. Simms introduce Nancy to the rest of the patients. Will Stanton is the first to introduce himself. He tells Nancy he had an accident gesturing to the wheel chair he is sitting in. Taryn reveals though that he was injured in a suicide jump not an accident. Kincade jumps to Wills defence and reveals that Taryn was a junkie injecting into her arms. Jennifer Caulfield shares that she wants to be an actress on TV when she leaves the hospital. Jennifer goes on to introduce Joey who doesn't speak.Taryn White is the next to introduce herself. She admits she is going through ""some very strange shit"" with her dreams and that the hospital is a better alternative to Juvie hall. Phillip interrupts to say that the doctors all believe their dreams are group psychosis despite the fact they all dreamt about Freddy before they had met and as a result just seem to go around in circles. Dr. Simms tells him they will not make any progress until the teens can accept the dreams as ""By products of guilt; psychological scars stemming from moral conflicts and overt sexuality.""Taryn Will and Joey play dungeons and dragons until Max comes to tell them that it is lights out. After Max and Taryn leave it is revealed that the boys take shifts to sleep. Nancy and Neil Gordon are getting coffee. He asks about Nancy's parents. She says her mum ""Died in her sleep"" and that she and her father don't have a good relationship. She tells Neil that the teens are in real physical danger from their dreams and he asks her about the Hypnocil she has been taking. He seems shocked that Nancy wants him to prescribe the drug to the kids. She confides she used to be like them and tells Neil that their survival depends on it but he refuses.One of Phillips puppets comes to life morphing into a mini Krueger. Making it's way to Phillip's bed it turns into Freddy. Freddy cuts the veins in Phillip's arms and legs creating puppet strings. Kincade sees Phillip being manipulated out of the room but thinking he is sleepwalking doesn't wake him. Freddy makes Phillip walk out of the ward and up the hospital tower. Joey sees Phillip standing at the edge of the ledge waking Will and carrying him to the window. Joey tries to get help banging a tray as he runs along the corridor to wake people. Will shouts from the window trying to wake Phillip. The group gathers to see Phillip fall to his death as Freddy cuts his strings.In group the next morning the kids are all upset. Kincade is annoyed blaming Phillips death on his weakness. Dr Gordon tries to tell them that it was suicide which the others do not believe. Taryn says it was murder. Dr Simms tells the teens that to prevent a reoccurrence all rooms will be locked at night and they will be sedated. This freaks Kincade out and as he gets irate Dr Simms beeps for security and he is sent to isolation once more. He is dragged away and despite Nancy's protests Simms says she is going to begin sedation that night. Neil decides to prescribe Hypnocil despite Simms reservations.Kincade is locked in the quiet room struggling to sleep. Jennifer is watching TV as research in the common room. Max tries to make her go back to her room but seeing she is upset allows her to stay so she doesn't sleep. Taryn has been showering and is accosted by an orderly who offers her the keys to the dispensary. She says that she doesn't do that anymore and goes to her room. Jennifer finds a cigarette lights it and then burns her hand to keep herself awake. She flicks through the channels stopping on The Dick Cavett Show which has Zsa Zsa Gabor as the guest. After a few minutes Cavett suddenly turns into Freddy and attacks Gabor after which the signal cuts out. Screams and the rhyme can be heard as Jennifer goes over to the TV. Arms burst out of the side of the television and grab Jennifer before Freddy's head emerges from the top. Freddy shouts ""Welcome to Prime-Time bitch!"" before fatally ramming Jennifer's head through the screen.Neil watches at her funeral from a distance. The nun he saw earlier approaches him and asks him about his faith. He tells her that he saw her before and asks if Sister Mary-Helena does volunteer work at the hospital. She says she does from time to time ""When needed"" and tells him that the only way to save the children is to put the unquiet spirit to rest. Nancy approaches and when he turns around the nun has disappeared.Neil and Nancy share a meal and he sees Nancy's Malaysian dream doll which s supposed to bring good dreams. He is worried about the kids and doesn't know what to do. He can't make sense of it. Nancy wonders if he is ready to hear the truth telling him to put everything else aside and just trust her.In group unofficially Neil allows Nancy to tell the kids about Freddy. Although skeptical at first when she describes his dirty brown hat his burnt face and the razors on his right hand they believe her. She tells them that the man is Freddy Krueger a child murderer before he died and after something much worse. She shares the fact that six years ago he had killed her friends and almost killed her as revenge for his death. Their parents had burnt him alive after a mistake with a search warrant leading to his arrest caused all charges to be dropped and Krueger to go free.Although unable to believe it at first the kids do believe it. Nancy reveals Kristens gift and tells the others that she is the key but that they all have their own inner strengths they can harness in the dream world. Neil tells them they are going to try a little group hypnosis. He gets them to relax and follow a pendulum as Nancy tells Kristen to take them to the dream world.At first little seems to have changed; they are in the same room and decide to take a break before trying again. Joey wanders out of the room spotting the young nurse he helped previously. She tells him that she wanted to talk to him alone as she really likes him. She claims that she makes up excuses to come into the ward as he is soooo cute.Dr Gordon sets off a perpetual motion device and the ball bearings break away and float around the room revealing that they are actually dreaming despite initial appearances. Neil struggles to believe till Will stands up. In his dreams he can walk and is ""The Wizard Master"" which he demonstrates by turning a ball bearing into a butterfly. Kristen is able to back flip and somersault in her dreams Kincade is super strong Taryn is ""beautiful and bad"" but in the fill she looks the ugliest punk girl you could ever imagine!Joey is in the room with the nurse. She asks him to unzip her uniform revealing she is topless underneath. Asking if he likes her body Joey nods enthusiastically. She pushes him back on the bed and kisses him before biting his tongue and pulling it from his mouth. Tongues are used to bind Joeys wrists and ankles and the nurse is revealed to be Krueger. ""Feeling tongue-tied?"" he asks. The mattress disappears to reveal a hell pit.At this moment the others realize that Freddy is close and he has Joey. The room morphs into a boiler room despite Kincades attempts to stop it. The screams alert Dr. Simms who is not happy. Joey is on the floor seemingly in a coma. This is blamed on the Hypnocil Dr. Gordon has prescribed and both he and Nancy are suspended. As he clears out his stuff Neil looks at a photograph and is then distracted by Sister Mary-Helena in the tower. The door is locked but Neil breaks in and climbs the tower.The nun is at the top of the tower. She reveals that the room was once used to house the most dangerous criminally insane patients at the hospital. The wing was closed in the forties after a young girl was locked in the wing over the holidays. The inmates kept her hidden for days raping her hundreds of times. When she was found she was barely alive and was most unfortunately impregnated. The girl was Amanda Krueger Freddy's mum. She tells Neil that the only way to stop Freddy is to find his remains and then bury them in hallowed ground.Nancy visits with Joey. She demands that Freddy releases him. The words ""Come and Get him Bitch"" appear carved on his chest. Nancy wants to go into the dream realm and fight Freddy but Neil tells her they have another option. She agrees to try and she tells him that only one man will know the whereabouts of the remains. Kristen fights against staff as it is revealed that Nancy has been suspended. She is taken to the quiet room and sedated for her outburst screaming that Dr Simms is killing them!The man Nancy referred to is revealed to be her Dad. They meet him in a bar and he is clearly drunk and although initially pleased to see her when Nancy reveals the reason for the visit is less happy. He insists Nancy just needs to let it go because Krueger is dead. Despite Nancy's pleas he refuses to reveal where the bones are and dismisses her. Nancy is very upset.Taryn pages Dr Gordon informing him that Kristen has been sedated and locked in the quiet room. He urges Nancy to go to the hospital and to convince Dr Simms what is happening is real. He tells her he will speak to her father and make him tell the location of Freddy's remains. He goes back into the bar introduces himself and then throws Lt. Donald Thompson against the wall. Neil says that he cares if Nancy lives or dies even if her father doesn't and so they are going on a scavenger hunt.Neil drives them to a church takes the keys and leaving Donald outside goes to get holy water and a crucifix. He is stopped by a priest and leaves his driving license in return for the things he needs promising to return them. Nancy arrives at the hospital and Max prevents her from seeing Kristen but reluctantly agrees to let her see the others. She finds them in the TV room and takes them for a last group session. Neil and Nancy's dad pull up at The Penny Bros Auto Salvage yard the hiding place of Freddy's remains. Going inside Neil is directed to the heart of the place.Nancy tells Kincade Will and Taryn that Joey and Kristen need them. She assures them nobody has to go in warning them if they die in the dream world then they die for real. They all want in so urging them to stick together they imagine themselves in the quiet room with Kristen. When Nancy counts back from five they are there in the room with Kristen who is delighted to see them. Kristen says that Joey needs them. Nancy asks where he is and at that moment the padded walls are ripped to shreds by Freddy's claws. Terrified the group huddles in the centre of the room padding showering them.As the padding clears Kristen is back in her bedroom working on the model house as she was the night of her ""suicide attempt."" She is surprised as her mum bursts in and the night repeats itself. She gives her mum a huge hug telling her she has had a terrible dream. She asks her mum to stay with her but her mum has a guest. This time it turns out to be Freddy who rips Elaine's head off and the decapitated head admonishes Kristen for her attention seeking behaviour. Freddy tries to stab Kristen but she uses her gymnastic skills to evade him. She jumps out the window but instead of landing outside finds herself in the Elm Street house rolling down the stairs.Getting to her feet Kristen calls for Nancy. She is heard by Taryn who tries to find her instead finding herself in an alley. A wall appears behind her with Taryn and Freddy in a heart sprayed on it trapping her. Taryn is shocked by Freddy who say's ""Welcome Home....Look familiar?"" Taryn uses flick knives to fight Freddy stabbing him in the stomach. Freddy asks why they are fighting when they are old friends and holds his hands up to reveal syringes of blue liquid instead of blades. Taryn backs away as the injection marks on her arm begin to suck. Freddy plunges both sets of syringes into Taryn throwing her aside dead. ""What a rush!"" he declares.Will finds himself in a long passage way. He calls out for the others hearing Freddy laugh. He turns to find a wheelchair. Freddy invites him to sit reminding him he will be back in it when he wakes up. The chair chases Will causing him to fall. He calls on his ""Wizard Master"" powers. Rising to his feet Will shouts ""In the name of Lowrek Prince of Elves demon begone"" and blasts Freddy with green light. He runs towards Freddy who grabs him. Saying he doesn't believe in fairy tales he plunges his blades into Wills chest killing him too.Kristen continues her search for the others finally finding Nancy. The wall to the room begins to break and Kincade is revealed using his super strength to reunite them. They embrace and Kincade shouts for Freddy. A door to the boiler room appears behind them. Nancy leads the way down a spiral staircase to search for Freddy.Meanwhile Neil and Donald finally reach the centre of the salvage yard. Donald directs Neil to a red caddy. After a struggle he opens the boot to reveal the remains of Fred Krueger rapped in a sack. Donald tries to escape but Neil has the keys and tells him he is going to attend a funeral ""one that is long overdue."" He throws him a spade.Nancy and the others reach the bottom of the staircase to find Joey suspended over a hell pit. Freddy appears and when Nancy tells him to let Joey go he undoes the tongue bindings. Nancy reaches Joey just in time to stop him falling. Kristen attacks Freddy as Kincade pulls Nancy and Joey to safety. He strikes Freddy with a length of pipe and when Freddy grabs him by the throat Nancy drives a thin lead pipe through him. His shock quickly turns to a sinister smile and still holding Kincade by the throat he pulls it out discarding it.Nancy can not believe how strong Freddy has become. He informs her that the souls of the children make him strong pulling aside his jumper to reveal the faces of screaming children on his torso. Then he disappears.....causing Kincade to fall to the floor.In the real world at the salvage yard Neil and Nancy's father have dug a grave. They stop when Neil hears noises and after Donald assures him that they are alone all the cars come to life lights flashing boots and doors flapping and horns blasting. Donald screams ""Bury the fucking thing!"" but as Neil approaches the remains the skeleton reanimates taking swipes at him with his bladed hand. Donald stands shocked. ""It's really you....I killed you once before you son of a bitch!"" Donald attacks but ends up impaled on a spike of metal. Neil attempts to fight Freddy but is hit with the spade and knocked into the grave. Freddy begins to shovel dirt onto him as he lies unconscious.Laughing the skeleton collapses and Freddy returns to the dream realm. Nancy Kristen Kincade and Joey are walking along a corridor papered in red and decorated with mirrors. A large mirror appears blocking their path and then Freddy appears. He apologizes for keeping them waiting and says ""If only there was more of me to go around?!"" his image then appears laughing in all of the mirrors. Joey backs into a corner clearly scared. The Freddy's grab the others dragging them into the mirrors. Joey stands and screams ""NO!!"" All the mirrors smash freeing the others. They believe it to be over.Nancy's father appears telling her he has crossed over but couldn't go without telling her that he was sorry for all the things he had done and that he loves her. Nancy embraces her father then gasps as her father turns into Freddy and plunges his claws into her stomach. ""Die!"" he snarls as he pushes the blades in deeper. Neil finally awakens semi buried in the grave.Kristen screams and Freddy causes the door behind her to close separating her from Kincade and Joey. ""You're mine now little piggy!"" He tosses Nancy aside and knocks Kristen to the floor. Holding his arm back he is about to stab her when Nancy grabs him forcing his blades into himself instead.Neil climbs out of the grave kicks in the bones of Krueger and splashes them with holy water. As he does rays of holy/spiritual light appear on Freddy's torso. Nancy is once more tossed aside landing by Kristen. Neil continues to splash holy water ""Ashes to ashes dust to dust I lay this spirit to rest."" He places the crucifix on his head causing Freddy to spin and explode in a ball of golden light a cross of light on his forehead.Kristen sobs as Kincade breaks down the door. Kristen says she won't let Nancy die and will instead dream her into a beautiful dream. Kristen holds Nancy's dead body.Kincade Joey Kristen and Neil all attend Nancy's funeral Neil with a sling on his arm. He turns to see the nun Sister Mary-Helena walking through the graveyard.
