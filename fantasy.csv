"An army major awakens in a small room with no idea of who he is or how he got there. He finds four other people in the same room, and they all begin to question how they each arrived there, and more importantly, how to escape.::John D. Tice"
"It all starts when an army major wakes up in a small cylindrical room with no way out. The walls are too high to climb and they're too hard to puncture. Trapped inside with him is a clown, a bagpiper, a ballerina, and a hobo. They have all woken up inside there and have no idea where they are, what they're doing there, how long they've been there or even who they are or how long they'll be there. They apparently are unable to feel anything, and every now and then a loud clanging sound makes them all fall down. All of them have tried various ways of finding an exit, unsuccessfully. The army major especially is determined to escape. He tries all sorts of ways to find an exit, but he cannot find one. Even when he hits the walls with his sword, it shatters. The major suggests that they are in Hell, so there IS no way out. Eventually the five characters decide that the only way out is to make a human tower. But then when the ballerina nearly reaches the top, the clanging sound goes again and they all fall down. They try again and the major falls over the edge, out of the cylinder, onto... The scene then cuts to a little girl picking up a doll in the snow and putting it back into a toy barrel--an Army Major doll. It turns out that the prisoners in the cylinder are actually toy dolls, and the room is a toy collecting barrel for an orphans' home, and the clanging sound is the collecting woman ringing her bell.::almightyone"

"NOTE: Sequel to ""House of Frankenstein"" (1944)Dr Franz Edelman [Onslow Stevens] of Visaria has a reputation for treating patients with strange diseases. Consequently, Count Dracula [John Carradine] (known to the outside world as Baron Latos) and Larry Talbot [Lon Chaney, Jr] (aka The Wolfman) come to Edelman in search of cures for their problems. After securing a blood sample from Dracula, Edelman finds that his blood contains an unknown parasite. Edelman thinks he can create an antitoxin and administer it through a series of blood transfusions. In the meantime, Dracula can sleep in his coffin in the basement.Talbot doesn't fare as well. When he calls, Edelman is unable to see him, so Talbot races to the village jail and asks to be confined in a cell. When Edelman arrives, he is able to personally witness the transformation of Talbot into the Wolfman and agrees to attempt a cure. After examining Talbot, Edelman announces that pressure on his brain is causing his glands to secrete an abnormal supply of the hormone that causes him to transform. Fortunately, in an attempt to help his nurse Nina [Jane Adams] become cured of her hunchback, Edelman has been working on a mold which softens calcium salts (i.e., bone). This mold might also be used to reshape Talbot's skull and take some of the pressure off his brain.Unfortunately, it will take at least a month to produce enough of the mold for the operations. Distraught at the thought of becoming the Wolfman one more time, Talbot attempts suicide by jumping from a cliff. Thinking that the rushing river below might have washed Talbot into some nearby caves, Edelman is lowered into the caves where he discovers perfect conditions for growing the molds and convinces Talbot to return for treatment. He also discovers the body of the Frankenstein monster [Glenn Strange] as well as a secret passageway between the cave and his laboratory.In the meantime, Dracula has become smitten with Edelman's other nurse, the luscious Miliza Morelle [Martha O'Driscoll], and tries to entice her into joining him. But Nina oversees the Baron casting no reflection in a mirror and reports this observation to Edelman who rushes to the garden in time to save Miliza. Edelman tells Dracula that another transfusion must be done immediately. This time, however, Dracula reverses the blood flow so that some of his blood contaminates Edelman. When Edelman realizes what Dracula has done, he moves Dracula's coffin into the sunlight and destroys him, releasing the hold on Miliza.But now Edelman starts transforming. During the day he is himself, but at night he surges with the urge to kill. Knowing that his time is limited, Edelman operates on Talbot. That night, from his wheelchair by the window, Talbot sees Edelman hop a cart. Edelman subsequently kills the cart driver, and the villagers follow him home thinking that he is Talbot. The police interview both Edelman and Talbot but agree that Talbot is physically incapable of such activity. Talbot has put two and two together and promises Edelman that he will say nothing until Edelman is able to operate on Nina.That night, however, Edelman reawakens the Frankenstein monster. Nina tries to stop him, but Edelman strangles her. Talbot shoots Edelman, and the Frankenstein monster turns on Talbot and begins destroying the laboratory. The monster is killed in a fire, and Talbot walks off into the moonlight with Miliza. [Original synopsis by bj_kuehl.]

"A group of men play cards at a posh club in modern-day Washington D.C. and discuss the idea of time travel and whether one could, in theory, change the past. One of the men, Corrigan (), is doubtful, and leaves the club, accidentally colliding with a butler on his way out. Once outside, he experiences a strange, dizzying sensation as the world seems to shift around him. He decides to head home, but once there, the landlady does not recognize him and is suspicious when he asks for a room, saying she only rents to ""acceptable"" boarders and asking about his personal history. A couple comes down the stairs on the way to the theatre and the landlady greets them, telling them to ""applaud the president."" Corrigan asks her what she meant by the comment, and when he looks at the man's antiquated military uniform, he realizes that he has traveled back to 1865, and that it is April 14, the night on which President Lincoln will be shot. He asks the couple about the play they are seeing, and they confirm that it is Our American Cousin at the Ford Theatre, where the assassination took--or will take--place. Shocked, he immediately runs to the theatre and shouts that the president is about to be murdered, and he is arrested and locked up, despite his protests. A man calling himself Mr. Wellington () comes to the station, having heard about Corrigan's arrest, and offers to take the man into his custody to help him. One of the policeman has doubts and wonders if they should take Corrigan seriously, but the sergeant brushes him off and releases Corrigan to Wellington.Wellington takes the man to his room and pours him a drink, and informs him that he is a psychiatrist, although he is unfamiliar with the futuristic term. He asks about Corrigan's claims, and Corrigan says that he is sure about what is going to happen, but he cannot explain why, knowing it sounds impossible. He suddenly starts to feel faint and ill, and realizes that Wellington has drugged him. Wellington lends him his handkerchief, telling him that he is ill and needs to rest, and departs. Corrigan struggles valiantly to the door to warn someone about the assassination, but he passes out. When he is discovered by a policeman and a chambermaid, he tells them what happened, but they tell him that no one named Wellington is staying in the house. He looks back at the handkerchief and sees the ""J.W.B."" monogram and realizes, to his horror, that the man was in fact John Wilkes Booth, the assassin of Lincoln, and that he drugged Corrigan to prevent him interfering. They suddenly hear a crowd outside spreading the news, and Corrigan realizes that he is too late and the murder has already taken place. He laments that no one listened to him and goes outside--and finds that he is back in the 1960s, as if nothing has happened.When he goes back into the club, he finds the man with whom he collided previously sitting at the table with the other gentlemen, sharing stories about acquiring wealth. The man talks about how his great-grandfather became wealthy when he infamously tried to warn people of Lincoln's assassination ahead of time, and though he failed, he gained notoriety and eventually became the chief of police and amassed a fortune. Stunned, Corrigan asks the man if he was ever an attendant at the club, and, taken aback, the man replies no, as he has always been a person of wealth. Corrigan states that he now believes it is possible to change some things in the past, although not everything. Reaching into his pocket, he discovers he still has the handkerchief."

"Three scholars -- two Americans (Michelle [Laura Mae Tate] and Lillian [Michelle McBride]) and native Transylvanian Mara [Irina Movila] -- arrive at historic Pledmar Fortress in Pledmar, Transylvania where they have obtained permission to reside while studying Transylvanian folklore. One legend has it that, some 500 years ago, a handful of peasants from Vlad Tepes' army barricaded themselves in the fortress against the Turks. When food and water was gone and the peasants ventured from the fortress, they found dead Turks with bloody throats, victims of vampires. A second legend tells about the presentation of the bloodstone, a stone from which drips the blood of saints and keeps vampires alive, keeps the vampires from biting any resident of Pledmar.The upcoming Festival of the Undead is held each year to celebrate the night that the vampires saved the people of Pledmar. In fact, the peasants believe that vampire King Vladislav Valescu still lives nearby in Castle Vladislav. But they're wrong. Unbeknown to the villagers, King Vladislav has just been murdered by his firstborn son, the evil Radu [Anders Hove], who has taken the bloodstone as his birthright and created four subspecies to do his bidding.

As night overtakes them, they realize that they are being followed. Before Radu can attack, however, they run into Stefan who sees them safely back and then returns to the castle where he finds his murdered father and is attacked by his evil brother. While Stefan stumbles back to the Fortress, Radu finds Lillian and sucks blood from her arm. Just as Radu prepares to drink from her neck, Stefan makes it back to the Fortress and opens her door in time to interrupt.

Michelle and Mara attend the Festival of the Undead where they photograph the villagers, all wearing masks and dancing in a cemetery. A white horse is made to jump over fresh graves.

Michelle is pleased to see Stefan there; the two share their first kiss. Radu is also there. When Michelle leaves the festival to check on Lillian, Radu abducts Mara. Lillian dies of ""blood poisoning."" To protect her body from mutilation by the villagers, Karl and Michelle bury Lillian in the cemetery at the castle ruins.

Michelle goes out to her and is abducted, taken to the castle, and placed in chains with Mara. Michelle manages to break the chains away from the wall. She frees Mara who turns vampire and turns on Michelle. Mara, Lillian and Radu take Michelle to Stefan who is also being held in chains. Radu plans to desecrate Michelle in front of Stefan.

"In Egypt, Yousef Bey (John Carradine) journeys to a remote temple in answer to a summons from Andoheb, High Priest of Arkham (George Zucco). Andoheb has called him to undertake a mission for the priesthood, but first refreshes his memory on the story of Kharis (Lon Chaney Jr.).3000 years ago, Kharis and the Princess Ananka were involved in a forbidden love affair. The princess died and because of her sin, her soul was cursed forever. Kharis was buried alive along with her. 30 years prior to the present time, an expedition located and entered the tomb of Ananka. They fought and escaped from the guardian of the tomb-the living Mummy of Kharis. The archaeologists brought Ananka's body back to the Scripps Museum in the United States. However, the priests of Arkham sent Kharis to seek vengeance against the defilers of the tomb. Every person from the expedition that entered the tomb died at the Mummy's hands. Kharis was believed to be destroyed in a fire at the residence of Stephen Banning (Dick Foran), leader of the expedition.The same story is being told to a group of skeptical college students in Mapleton Massachusetts. Professor Norman (Frank Reicher) expands on the story, explaining how Kharis was kept alive by the fluid of the leaves of the Tana bush, a plant that has long been extinct. In fact, Professor Norman himself was entrusted with a quantity of the tana leaves that investigators found in order to conduct scientific research.After the lecture ends, one of the students, Tom Hervey (Robert Lowery), meets up with his girlfriend Amina Mansori (Ramsay Ames), a beautiful woman of Egyptian descent. Amina has been researching Egyptian history, which has brought on a strange, clouded feeling in her mind.Back in Egypt, Andoheb informs Yousef Bey that Kharis still lives and that Yousef's mission is to retrieve Kharis and the body of Ananka and return them to their rightful resting place in Egypt. Yousef Bey then pledges his devotion:""I swear by the mighty power of Amon-Ra, whose anger can shatter the world and by the dread horror of Set, that I shall never forsake my trust as a Priest of Arkham. Nor shall I rest until the Princess Ananka and Kharis are safe once more in the Hills of Arkham.""Andoheb explains that each night during the cycle of the full moon, Yousef Bey is to brew the fluid from 9 tana leaves and that wherever Kharis is, the Mummy will sense this and find the leaves. The moon is full in Mapleton as Professor Norman studies the hieroglyphics on the case of tana leaves. He has deciphered the message about brewing 9 tana leaves during the full moon and decides to do just that.The battered, ragged form of Kharis now appears, his right arm is useless and held in a sling, his right eye burned and sealed shut. He senses the leaves brewing and begins instinctively heading toward them. On the way, he passes the home of Amina and his presence arouses her from a fitful sleep. She wanders outside in a trance-like state. She does not see Kharis, who is now some distance ahead, but somehow follows the same course. Kharis soon arrives at the home of Professor Norman and enters his study. Norman looks up and is shocked to see the Mummy shambling toward him with one arm extending, reaching for the Professor's throat. Soundlessly and brutally, Kharis strangles Norman and then drinks the fluid of the tana leaves.Amina now approaches and Kharis senses her presence and heads back outside. From a concealed location, Amina sees Kharis, which snaps her out of her trance but also causes her to immediately faint. She falls to the ground with a strange birthmark now apparent on her wrist.The next morning, Tom Hervey learns that Professor Norman was murdered and that Amina was found at the scene and detained. He immediately heads for the Professor's home. At the home, Sherriff Elwood (Harry Shannon) and the Coroner (Emmett Vogan) investigate the scene of the crime. They discover a strange mold around the Professor's throat; a sign they both know to mean that the Mummy stalks Mapleton again. The Sherrif questions Amina, who has developed a white streak in her hair overnight. Amina is dazed and confused, but Elwood continues to grill her until Hervey arrives. Tom unsuccessfully tries to provide an alibi for Amina and the Sherrif maintains his suspicions in her involvement. Elwood finally dismisses the pair but gives Amina the obligatory warning not to leave the area. Tom takes her home to comfort her but is himself disturbed by the changes in her appearance.Panic begins to grip the town as newspaper reports of the killing highlight the involvement of the Egyptian woman and the speculation that the Mummy has returned. Townspeople are warned to stay indoors at night and all able-bodied men are asked to help patrol the streets after dark.Weeks later Yousef Bey, who has arrived in Mapleton, calls on Amon-Ra to aid him in his quest and begins to brew the sacred fluid of the tana leaves to summon Kharis. Kharis, indeed, senses the leaves and heads toward them. Tom and Amina are out for a drive that same night. Amina is finally beginning to return to normal, laughing and no longer hearing voices or suffering from fevers and chills. Unseen, Kharis passes near them, causing Amina's mood to suddenly change and for her to feel an unnatural cold. Despite Tom professing his love for her, Amina cannot shake the strange feeling and asks to be taken home.Kharis continues on his quest for the tana leaves, passing through the Evans farm. The family dog is startled by his presence and begins to bark incessantly. Mr. Evans (Eddy Waller), armed with a shot gun, comes out of the house to investigate and is surprised by Kharis. Evans fires his weapon at the Mummy to no avail. Kharis swiftly murders the man and busts through the wall of the barn, undeterred from his quest. The Sherrif soon arrives on the scene and, recognizing the evidence of Kharis, plans to organize a search party. Kharis, meanwhile, finds Yousef Bey and consumes the life-giving tana leaves. Yousef thanks his god for his success thus far and re-pledges his devotion to their mission.The next day, at the Scripps Museum, Yousef Bey lags behind a tour group viewing the Mummy of Ananka. He asks Amon-Ra for forgiveness for allowing these heretics to view the sacred remains of the Princess. After closing time, Yousef emerges from a hiding place as Kharis breaks into the museum. The two are excited with anticipation as their mission appears near an end. Yousef encourages Kharis by telling him the Tombs of Arkham are waiting to claim their own. Kharis attempts to touch the mummified body, but it disintegrates under the wrapping as his hand approaches. At that same moment, Amina, miles away in her home, awakens screaming. Yousef Bey realizes that Ananka's soul has been re-incarnated into another form. Kharis is enraged and begins destroying the exhibit, attracting the museum security guard (Oscar O'Shea). The guard enters, not seeing Kharis, and draws his gun on the High Priest. The Mummy exits the shadows and moves toward the horrified man. He fires several shot at point blank range, but the Mummy is not even slowed. Kharis crushes his throat as Yousef Bey looks on with glee. Yousef Bey realizes that the two must still fulfill their mission and find the new vessel holding Ananka's soul and return it to Egypt.Tom Hervey visits Sherrif Elwood, seeking permission to take Amina away to New York to restore her health. Elwood says he is not trying to implicate Amina in the murders, but denies Hervey's request. At the Scripps Museum, the body of the guard is found and the tell-tale marks of mold identify the killer as Kharis. Police Inspector Walgreen (Barton MacLane) and Dr. Ayad (Lester Sharpe) from the museum are bewildered as to how Ananka's body has disappeared without disturbing the wrappings. Dr. Ayad translates the markings on the tomb for the Inspector:""Herein rests the body of Ananka, third daughter of Amenophis. In the Hills of Arkham shall Ananka lie in the tomb appointed for her and in none other, because freed from its resting place, her soul may find reincarnation in another form, again to seek out its salvation on earth.""The Inspector is skeptical but asks the Doctor to accompany him to Mapleton to investigate further. Upon arriving, they seek out the assistance of Sherrif Elwood and the group convenes at the home of the late Professor Norman. Dr. Ayad translates most of the markings on the cask of tana leaves and Inspector Walgreen decides to use the leaves to attract and capture Kharis. Since bullets are useless against the Mummy, the plan is to build a pit to confine the creature until a way to deal with him can be found.Amina is still unable to shake the haunted feelings that torture her. Tom, disregarding the Sherrif's warnings, asks Amina to elope with him to New York. Amina tries to discourage him but Tom is insistent. She agrees and the two make plans to leave early the next morning. Tom leaves Amina in the care of her guardian, Mrs. Blake (Dorothy Vaughan) and Tom's faithful dog, Peanuts.Yousef Bey calls upon Amon Ra to lead him to the new home of Ananka's soul. Just then, a window blows open and Yousef sees the moon, which resembles the scene on the ceremonial amulet he wears as a Priest of Arkham. Knowing that this is a sign from the gods, he sends Kharis in that direction to find Ananka.Using the widowed Mrs. Norman's (Claire Whitney) recollections as a guide, Inspector Walgreen now begins to bait his trap by burning nine tana leaves. Kharis immediately senses this, and heads toward the Norman home--a course that takes him directly past Amina's home. Amina is awakened by his approach and hypnotically wanders into the yard. Kharis sees her and recognizes her as the carrier of Ananka's soul. Amina faints as Kharis picks her up and takes her away.The abduction is witnessed by Mrs. Blake, who phones Tom to alert him. Tom immediately sets out in pursuit. Mrs. Blake, then heads to the Norman house and tells her story to Inspector Walgreen, Sherrif Elwood and a large group of volunteers. A frantic chase now ensues. Kharis and Amina are headed for the old mill where Yousef Bey waits. Tom, led by Peanuts, is hot on their trail, while further back is the mob. Kharis arrives at the mill and presents Amina to Yousef Bey. Bey recognizes the birthmark on her wrist as the symbol of the Priests of Arkham. Amina awakens and the Priest informs her that she is, indeed, the reincarnation of Ananka. Amina denies this but Yousef Bey warns her:""For those who defy the will of the ancient gods, a cruel and violent death shall be their fate, never shall they find rest unto eternity.""Yousef Bey now begins to admire Amina's beauty and feels the pangs of temptation to keep her alive as his bride.

"In 1799, New York City police constable Ichabod Crane is dispatched to the upstate Dutch hamlet of Sleepy Hollow, which has been plagued by a series of brutal decapitations: a wealthy father and son, and a widow. Received by the insular town elders-wealthy businessman Baltus Van Tassel; town doctor Thomas Lancaster; the Reverend Steenwyck; notary James Hardenbrook; and magistrate Samuel Philipse-Ichabod learns that locals believe the killer is the undead apparition of a headless Hessian mercenary from the American Revolutionary War who rides a black steed in search of his missing head.Ichabod begins his investigation, skeptical of the paranormal story. Boarding at the home of Baltus Van Tassel and his wife, Lady Van Tassel, he is taken with Baltus' spiritual daughter, Katrina. When a fourth victim is killed, Ichabod takes the victim's son, Young Masbath, under his wing. Ichabod and Masbath exhume the victims on a tip from Philipse, learning that the widow died pregnant; Ichabod witnesses the Horseman killing Philipse shortly after. He, Young Masbath and Katrina, venture into the Western Woods, where a crone living in a cave reveals the location of the Horseman's grave at the ""Tree of the Dead."" He digs up the Horseman's grave and discovers the skull has been taken, deducing that it has been stolen by someone who now controls him and that the tree is his portal into the living world.The Horseman then kills the village midwife and her family, as well as Katrina's suitor Brom when he attempts to intervene; Ichabod hypothesizes that the Horseman is attacking select targets linked by a conspiracy. He and Masbath visit Hardenbrook, who reveals that the first victim, Peter Van Garrett, had secretly married the widow, writing a new will that left his estate to her. Ichabod deduces that all the victims (except Brom) are either beneficiaries or witnesses to this new will, and that the Horseman's master is the person who would have otherwise inherited the estate: Baltus, a Van Garrett relative.Katrina, upon discovering the accusation, burns the evidence. Hardenbrook commits suicide, and Steenwyck convenes a town meeting to discredit Ichabod, but Baltus bursts into the assembly at the church, announcing that the Horseman has killed his wife. The Horseman attacks the church, but is unable to enter. In the chaos, the remaining elders turn on and attack each other: Steenwyck and Lancaster are killed, and the Horseman harpoons Baltus through a window, dragging him out of the church and acquiring his head.Initially concluding that Katrina controls the Horseman, Ichabod discovers that her diagram, which he believed summoned the Horseman, is really one of protection, and additionally finds a post-mortem wound on ""Lady Van Tassel's"" body. Lady Van Tassel, alive and well, then reveals herself to Katrina, and explains her true heritage from an impoverished family evicted years ago by Van Garrett when he favored Baltus and Katrina instead. She swore revenge against Van Garrett and all who had wronged her, pledging herself to Satan if he would raise the Horseman to avenge her, and also to claim the estate uncontested. Manipulating her way into the Van Tassel household, she used fear, blackmail, and lust to draw the other elders into her plot. Having eliminated all other heirs and witnesses - and having killed her sister, the crone, for aiding Ichabod - she summons the Horseman to finish Katrina.Ichabod and Masbath rush to the windmill as the Horseman arrives. After an escape that destroys the windmill and the subsequent chase to the Tree of the Dead, Ichabod throws the Horseman's skull to him. Freed, and with his head restored, the Horseman spares Katrina and attacks Lady Van Tassel, giving her a bloody kiss and returning to Hell with her in tow, fulfilling the deal.

"Paul Marsh is a wealthy stock market Tycoon in bad need of a vacation so, at the suggestion of his girlfriend, Barbara, they set out for the shores of Italy to explore the country where's Paul's family came from with the hopes of Paul learning more about his mother's hometown (which she always refused to talk about) while relaxing and taking in the sea air with their middle-aged friends Viki and Howard. Things are going well for them, the seas have been fine and though Paul has been plagued with frightening dreams of swimming with a beautiful black-haired, green eyed mermaid, everyone is having a grand time. Then, suddenly, as they are passing the little fishing village of Imbocca, a storm blows up, dashing the boat against the rocks.Vikki is trapped in the bottom of the boat in her bedroom, her leg broken and bleeding, trapped between the rocks and some of the splintered boat. Paul and Barbara take a life raft ashore to get help for Viki while Paul stays behind to try to help her stave off blood loss and hypothermia. At the docks, Barbara's talent for speaking Italian comes in handy as a gruff fisherman gives them directions to the local hotel and, hopefully, a telephone where they can call for help.The town is eerily quiet as they reach the hotel, though Barbara is too focused on saving her friend to care. Once at the hotel, a sickly pale man informs Barbara that there is no phone at the desk and asks her to come to the back, offering Paul a room for he and Barbara to stay in until help arrives.Paul accepts the room and heads upstairs only to find everything is disgustingly old and dirty in the room. Still, he waits there for Barbara. As he waits, he looks out the window and sees the streets filling with strange people, some limping, some grunting, all of them shouting in Italian, all of them not quite human, and all of them coming his way! He runs to his room door and locks it as best as he can, bolting it shut as the sounds of the villagers coming up the stairs can be heard. As the villagers turn the door handle, they realize the door is locked and begin to shout in an angry fashion as they pound on the door to break it down. Paul escapes though the bathroom window, falling through a thin roof, landing hard on a pile of unfinished leather.Finding himself in a derelict warehouse/leather tannery, he pulls himself to his feet and begins to limp around, looking for the exit. While searching for the door he finds out what the villages are tanning: human skin! Terrified, Paul bolts towards the door as fast as he can with his hurt leg, only to have it slide open. Paul hides behind one of the stretched human skins as the villages limp, walk, shuffle and drag themselves in. Their pale, dappled skins and vacant eyes seem inhuman as do their harsh, gurgling voices.Paul is forced to fight off several of the villagers who find him by lighting some of the skins on fire. As the villagers run to snuff out the flames, carrying away their precious human leather, Paul escapes by pretending to be a villager carrying out leather and flees down an alleyway. In the alleyway Paul is confronted by a drunk old human man. With a thick Italian accent he explains to Paul that he is the last Human in all Imbocca and tells Paul of the Rise of Dagon.Long ago Imbocca was a great fishing port. Then, suddenly, one day the fish stopped coming in and nobody could find out why. The people prayed and prayed but no fish came. Then one day, a strange man come to the village and told the people of Imbocca that their god was a false god that had deserted them and that if they followed him, he would show them a REAL god who would answer their prayers. the people at first ignored the stranger, but, as money and food ran thin, a small handful of men followed the stranger to the sea to watch him ask his god, Dagon, for help.The stranger put on a strange golden crown and stood by the sea, chanting a prayer in an alien tongue, calling upon Dagon for help. The next day, the shores were covered in seashells, starfish, and other items made of gold. The villagers couldn't believe their eyes! The town was rich and the fishing was good again, but the old man's parents didn't trust this new god and refused to share in the treasures from the sea. The stranger led the people of the town in killing their old priest and overhauling their church into a temple to Dagon. Now everyone was expected to worship Dagon and the entire town joined the stranger in his strange prayers... everyone except the old man and his parents, that is.The stranger, who had become the head of the temple to Dagon as well as the town mayor, noticed this lack of prayer and questioned the old man's parents in the church on it, demanding that they pray to Dagon. They refused and were killed. The boy was too frightened to speak, and so the temple head tore off the boy's cross necklace and blessed him in the name of Dagon before continuing the service.One day the fish stopped as did the gold, and the people asked why Dagon has forsaken him. Was it because they were not praying enough? No, it was because Dagon wanted sacrifices. Women were to be given to Dagon, not to be killed, but to be mated with, so his children would populate the town. Over time, between the breeding with Dagon and his children and the blessings of Dagon, all of Dagon's followers became fish-like so that one day they could serve their master in the sea. As the only person of the town not either a child of Dagon by faith or blood, the old man had remained human and was now the last man in Imbocca. The only reason he was not killed and skinned was because the townfolk considered him just a harmless old drunk, and had decided to leave him alone as he was no threat.Paul begins to panic realizing what will befall Barbara and Vickie, and begs the old man to take him to where they would be held to rescue them. The old man at first refuses, but eventually is persuaded to help. Using the old man as a stall tactic, Paul sneaks into the Mayor's manor where he is captured and is bound (along with the old man), and thrown into an old barn where he is reunited with Vickie and Barbara. Barbara is fine, but Vickie is shaken. When Paul asks why, Vickie mutters something half unintelligible about a strange creature attacking her in the boat, killing Howard and doing something to her. Paul is confused so the old man tries to put it gently to him.""He... err... took her..."", the old man slurs.Paul still is confused.""He... FUCKED her!"", the old man says, frustrated, and Paul begins to look frightened.Paul begins cutting the other loose with his pocket knife, succeeding just as their captors arrive. Vickie steals Paul's knife and holds it to her stomach, shouting that she is going to kill herself. Her captors try to talk her out of it, saying what an honor it is to be bearing Dagon's child, but Vickie is not swayed. She kills herself with the knife, and, in the confusion, Paul and the old man manage to kill one guard and subdue another before being recaptured by the guards' backup.Paul and the old man are taken into a barn and chained where a cruel-looking man is sharpening thin skinning knives. He tells them what an honor it will be for them to die and be used as ritual masks. They both are given one last chance to repent and join their worship of Dagon. The old man spits in the skinner's face and begins to recite the Lord's Prayer. Paul also refuses. The old man is skinned alive, still praying, and bleeds to death. Paul is next, when someone comes up and tells the skinner not to kill Paul but to instead take him into the house. Peeved, the skinner obeys.Paul is taken into the house and tries to scape again, fleeing down the hallways into the first door he can open, closing it behind him. In the dark there is a gasp as a lamp is turned on, revealing a beautiful woman who looks just like the Mermaid from Paul's dream! From the hallway there is a knock and a harsh gurgling voice asks if everything is OK as the girl's light is on and he heard her gasp.The girl replies, ""No, papa. I am fine. It was only a dream."", and there is the sound of someone limping away.Paul tries to refuse her, but he finds her irresistible as she beckons him closer. The two begin to kiss until Paul uncovers her legs to reveal a set of squid-like tentacles. Horrified, Paul pulls away from her.""No! Please... stay... stay with me! Please!!"" she begs, calling out to him as he runs back down the hallway, writhing her tentacles as if reaching out to him.Paul narrowly escapes the house pursued by the obviously inhuman villagers by hot wiring an old car, which ends up running off the road after hitting one of the fish men near an old house. Paul ducks into an old flooded house to hide only to find it occupied by a human-looking little boy. The little boy begins to shout in a language Paul doesn't understand an a HUGE, strong fish man comes up from the water to try to kill him as the boy cheers. The fish man tries to drown Paul in the toilet, and Paul retaliates by grabbing the cover to the back of the toilet and smashing it against the fish man's head. The fish man falls into the water, unconscious or dead, as the boy rushes to his side, begging him to get up.Paul escapes into the town and begins to look for a way to rescue Barbara. Guessing that the villagers intend to sacrifice her, he finds a can of Kerosene and heads to the church. The church is empty, but a gust of wind alerts Paul to a hidden passageway. Paul descends deep into dark, wet tunnels where he finds fish men in human-skin masks dancing around an open pit with Barbara, wearing golden ceremonial jewelry and nothing else, is suspended by chains. after a few moments, the squid girl from the bedroom is carried in on an ornate stretcher by two fish men. The squid girl reveals herself to be a priestess and now is dressed in ornate ceremonial garb including the same headdress worn by the Stranger in the old man's story. The priestess begins to lead a chant to Dagon and Cthulu as Barbara is lowered into the pit which is revealed to contain murky black water at it's bottom.Paul, taking a lighter from his pocket, runs out and begins to douse the fish men in kerosene, lighting them on fire with his lighter. They scream and run around in confusion, lighting each their on fire, while the priestess looks on in horror, begging Paul to stop. In the confusion, the winch lowering Barbara is let go of and she begins to swiftly plummet towards the murky water. Paul runs to the Winch, catching it, as he slowly begins to pull Barbara out of the water.The Fish men, snapping out of their confusion, surround paul with knives, ready to kill him. From the back of the gathering, a large man with a heavy limp plods out with a crutch. He wears a human skin mask and has one leg as a tentacle. ""Stop..."", he says with the same voice as Paul heard from within the hallway, ""He is... my son...""""Long ago..."", the priestess explains to Paul, ""He was young and handsome for a man. He brought women to Imbocca... including your mother. You are my brother, now you will be my lover...""Paul keeps cranking up the wench only to learn he got there too late. Now covered in a thick black substance, Barbara begs him to just let her die. At first he refuses, but the priestess begins to explain how Barbara is now part of Dagon, and so he lets Barbara go into the deep.Turning to the priestess with eyes full of Anger, Paul douses himself in Kerosene and lights himself on fire. The Priestess shouts ""No!"", then leaps onto Paul, knocking them both into the water. Once underwater, gills open up in Paul's neck and sides. The priestess smiles, swimming around him just like the mermaid in the dream. Now realizing that he is one of them, Paul takes her hand, smiling, and swims with her into an intricately carved tunnel under the sea.The screen fades to black and this quote appears.
""We shall swim out to that brooding reef in the sea and dive down through black abysses to Cyclopean and many columned Y'ha-nthlei, and in that lair of the Deep Ones we shall dwell amidst wonder and glory for ever."""

Paul goes alone off to the Cornwall coast, where his line snares on something, and he goes underwater.Paul comes to, and finds himself in a cave along with Miranda (Glynis Johns), a beautiful mermaid. Due to the nature of the cave, Paul is unable to leave, and Miranda delightfully explains that she intends to keep him as her prisoner (claiming an aversion to human men). Paul also finds the cave littered with newspapers and magazines, of which Miranda has read about humans and their ways. After a little time, Miranda decides to make Paul a deal: she will let him go if he will take her to London to see the sights. Miranda even concocts the perfect plan to get her about: they'll simply cover up her tail and say that Paul (as he is a physician) is helping her to recover.Paul is a little incensed at the plan, but goes along with it, ordering several dresses from a fashion designer he and his wife know...though the designer is rather perplexed regarding the need for a hemline that covers past a normal woman's feet.Paul returns to London with Miranda, but sends her out for a drive to see the city with the house butler, Charles (David Tomlinson). While they are out, Paul explains to Clare that Miranda will be staying with them for 4 weeks, and has arranged for a woman named Carey (Margaret Rutherford) to look after her.Over the course of the next few weeks, Miranda often displays some rather strange traits: she prefers to only eat raw fish or oysters, and some nights, she can be heard singing a lilting song in a rather unheard-of yet beautiful voice.She also manages to charm Charles (who is engaged to Betty (Yvonne Owen) the Martins maid), as well as a nearby artist named Nigel (John McCallum) who it just so happens is also engaged.

Surprisingly, Carey does not freak out, but is delighted, having believed that mermaids existed for many years.Soon, tensions rise when Charles' and Nigel's fiancées believe that their men are being charmed away from them, with Nigel's fiancée becoming jealous when she sees he's painted a portrait of Miranda.Clare meanwhile, has been noticing odd things here and there. A large fishbowl that once contained numerous small fish has been becoming increasingly emptier, and reports of Betty finding seaweed in Miranda's bathtub (not to mention finding the girl has no panties at all!), leads Clare to suspect that Miranda is a mermaid.The whole mess comes to a climax when Charles and Nigel come to see Miranda, both intending to propose marriage to her. It is then they each reveal that Miranda gave them a lock of her hair, and now feel foolish for having been 'played along' by her. Both men then leave to reconcile with the women they have spurned.Paul arrives soon after with Miranda, which Clare soon gets to admit is a mermaid. After finding that Charles and Nigel returned the locks of hair she gave them, Miranda admits to Clare that she intends to leave soon, intending to swim to warmer climates for the month of May.

However, 5-7 minutes later, Clare and Paul find her room empty, and notice Miranda outside, wheeling her chair to the nearby river.

"La película empieza en blanco y negro. Una niña mata a una adulta cortándole el cuello con un cuchillo. La sangre se ve roja y fuerte.Resulta que es un cuento que le están contando a una niña, a quien le dicen que la niña era una bruja en realidad. Flavia Goribar (Elsa María) es la nueva alumna en el colegio, aunque ya está avanzado, y ni siquiera tiene uniforme. La profesora le dice que se siente al lado de Verónica (Ana Patricia Rojo) por el momento. Verónica le dice a Flavia que su nombre es de araña, ya que ella tiene una araña en casa que se llama así.La abuelita (Marcela Páez) manda a Verónica a ir a bañarse. La criada se encarga de Verónica, le da la cena y le lee libros de brujas. La madre de Verónica murió en un accidente de coche, y la niña casi no se acuerda de ella. Flavia también se despide para irse a dormir de su madre (Lilia Aragón) y su padre (Sergio Bustamante). Esta niña no reza, ya que su madre que sólo rezan las niñas que tienen miedo. Nana (Carmela Stein) le cuenta a Verónica que una vez oyó a un fantasma, y que también vio una vez a uno. La niña quiere saber cómo se hace un pacto con el diablo.En el colegio, la señorita Ellis (Rocío Lazcano) va a coger una caja que Verónica le pidió. La niña se entretiene haciendo muecas. La profesora de Verónica tiene que irse unos meses para atender a un familiar enfermo, y Verónica lo oye. En clase, las niñas tienen que copiar el mapa de Francia. Verónica parece adivinar qué va a pasar, y dice a Flavia que es un búho. Verónica le dice que el búho está disecado. Nana manda a las niñas a jugar al jardín. Flavia no la quiere creer, pero Verónica le dice que que ella supiera lo que iba a pasar con Miss Ellis es parte de lo que el búho - que sólo habla de noche - le dijo. Verónica le dice a Flavia que ella es una bruja, y le manda guardar el secreto. Esa noche, Flavia le pregunta a su padre si existen las brujas, y él le dice que no. Su padre le dice que todo es superstición.Flavia tiene que estudiar piano, aunque no le guste. Va a casa de la profesora, Madame Rickard (Blanca Lidia Muñoz), que protesta porque siempre llega tarde. Madame enhebra un ovillo de lana mientras Flavia toca una serenata. La profesora le promete galletas si toca bien la canción.Otro día, Flavia y Verónica hacen un castillo de arena en el jardín. Flavia dice que seguro que Verónica había oído el chisme en alguna parte, porque su padre le dice que las brujas no existen. Verónica insiste en que ella es una bruja vieja y horrible. Los padres de Verónica están muertos, y la niña vive con su abuela. Verónica le pregunta si realmente no le daría miedo que ella se convirtiese en bruja. Verónica se esconde y Flavia ve a la abuela de Verónica. Flavia chilla y sale corriendo. Nana (Araceli de León) riñe a Verónica, que sabe de sobra que no puede jugar dentro de casa. Además, la abuela no quiere que nadie la vea y Nana obliga a Verónica a pedir perdón a la abuelita.Esa noche, Flavia tiene pesadillas. La rama de un árbol la asusta; sale corriendo y se encuentra un pájaro que viene del pasillo. Se abraza a su madre, que tiene manos de monstruo con garras afiladas: es una bruja (Leonor Llausás). Flavia se despierta sudando, y su madre la consuela. La madre le dice que todo fue una pesadilla. Verónica amenaza a Flavia por si ella dice algo. Flavia pide a su amiga que haga un encantamiento para que se acaben las clases de piano. Verónica monta un akelarre con sangre de ambas y velas negras.Dos niñas de la clase se ríen de las pretensiones de Verónica de ser bruja. Verónica le presta su caja de colores con una serpiente dentro. La directora, Miss Aragón (María Santander), le recuerda a Verónica de que ya estaba advertida de que podían expulsarla si volvía a portarse mal. Verónica lo niega todo y le echa la culpa a Flavia, que lo acepta. Flavia se queda en una habitación hasta que sus padres vayan a recogerla.Su abuela le da libros a Verónica que eran de su madre. Flavia toca mientras Madame Rickard prepara una taza de té. Madame Rickard está en el suelo, muerta. La madre sabía que eso le podía pasar, porque Madame Rickard ya había tenido dos infartos, fumaba como un carretero y no se cuidaba nada. Los padres piensan que la niña no aceptará a otra profesora porque quería muchísimo a Madame Rickard. En el funeral, es un día frío, lluvioso. Alguien abre el ataud para ver la cara de la profesora, y Flavia se desmaya. Su perro Hippy está en su cama, y Verónica visita a la enferma. La madre sale con Hippy. Flavia quería no volver a ver a Madame Rickard, pero no quería que se muriera. Verónica insiste en el secreto: el demonio se le aparecerá si Flavia dice algo. Verónica siente envidia de tantos juguetes que sus padres le regalan a Flavia. Verónica quiere llevarse a Betty, la muñeca favorita de Flavia; cuando Flavia no se la regala, Verónica dice que ela es capaz de entrar de noche por la ventana y robar la muñeca.Es medianoche. El reloj despierta a Flavia. Flavia ve el fantasma de Verónica con la muñeca, y la muñeca ya no está en su caja, sino que está alguien que abre los ojos. Flavia despierta y la muñeca está en su sitio. Flavia llora. Una niña le da a Flavia la pluma que se había dejado olvidada.Nana dice que vio a una momia. Verónica dice que Flavia le regaló la pluma, que parece de oro. Verónica quiere que Flavia se convierta en su esclava. Verónica lleva a Flavia a ver momias.Nana le dice que las hadas no se llevan bien con las brujas, que las matan. Verónica se pone a comer fruta para no tener que esperar por la comida que Nana está haciendo. Nana le dice que las brujas hacen veneno para las hadas en el caldero.Verónica amenaza a Flavia con que ella quiere ir al rancho a ver el estanque con patos y los caballos. La madrastra de Flavia empieza a preocuparse por la insana amistad entre las dos niñas. Al final, Verónica se va de vacaciones al rancho. Verónica siente envidia de la riqueza del padre de Flavia. Flavia enseña el pajar a Verónica. Verónica ve el cementerio del pueblo y quiere ir a verlo.Verónica y Flavia buscan a Toño (Ernesto Schwartz). Verónica busca un caldero, que lleva al pajar, para hacer un veneno que mate a las hadas. Esconden el caldero debajo de la paja en el alpendre de arriba del pajar al que muchas veces va Flavia a esconderse cuando no quiere ver a nadie. Verónica dice que tienen que buscar patas de araña, lagartijas, ceniza... hervirlo todo y con el olor de ese potingue matar a las hadas. A una iglesia abandonada van a buscar lagartijas. Otro día, se ensucian buscando un sapo, y la madrastra de Flavia les riñe porque se han destrozado los zapatos y huelen mal.Para buscar una serpiente, al final Verónica empuja a que Flavia robe una serpiente muerte que hay en la choza del capataz Toño, que tiene disecada en la pared un trozo de piel de serpiente.Además, Verónica insiste en ir al cementerio de noche con Flavia, pra demostrarle al demonio que no le tienen miedo. Cogen un candil, y para allá se van las dos en plena noche. Toño pilla a las dos niñas en el cementerio. El padre les riñe; Flavia le dice que querían tierra para matar a las hadas; Verónica dice que sólo era un juego. El padre las castiga a las dos, y Verónica promete vengarse. Verónica está columpiándose sola. Flavia intenta reconciliarse con ella, pero Verónica sigue enfadadísima. La madrastra de Flavia le dice que Hippy está cada día más travieso: se había subido al coche y el padre lo rescató. Es el último día de vacaciones y van a hacer el veneno para las hadas. A cambio de ver cómo se hace la poción, Verónica exige que Flavia le regale a Hippy. Flavia lo hace, llorando. Verónica juega ahora con Hippy, igual que antes era Flavia quien lo hacía. Es de noche, y van a hacer el conjuro. Como no tienen un gato negro, Verónica se lleva a Hippy, que intenta rebelarse y ladra. En el pajar, las niñas encienden velas y preparan un quinqué para hacer el caldo. Mientras Verónica trabaja en el caldero, Flavia, desde la entrada en el piso de abajo del pajar, realmente ve que la sombra de Verónica es la de una bruja monstruosa que se ríe malignamente. Flavia coge una vela encendida y prende fuego a la paja seca. Por si acaso, también retira la escalera de mano, único punto de entrada y salida al piso de arriba. Coge a Hippy y cierra la puerta del pajar con el cerrojo. El fuego está ya muy extendido cuando Verónica nota algo - la niña se asusta y empieza a suplicarle a Flavia que vuelva a ayudarle. El humo empieza a hacerla tosar. Flavia permanece afuera sujetando a Hippy, sin decir ni hacer nada. Verónica golpea una ventana, pero sólo consigue cortarse y ahcerse sangre en las muñecas. Verónica llora y llora, pero Flavia permance impasible; más bien sonríe un poquito abrazada a Hippy. Todo el pajar está ya en llamas - a la luz del incendio, Flavia está tranquila y sonríe. ---- Escrito por KrystelClaire"

"Close friends Pete Sandich (Richard Dreyfuss) and Al Yackey (John Goodman) combat major wildfires from the air, flying World War II-vintage water bombers. Pete is a risk taker, to the growing worry of his girlfriend, Dorinda Durston (Holly Hunter), as well as Al. After he runs his plane out of fuel to make an extra retardant drop, Dorinda and Al both express their concern for his safety; Al tells him about the impending start-up of an air attack training base in Flat Rock, Colorado, which will need a commanding officer. Pete dismisses the notion out of hand, with too great a love of flying and fighting fire to give it up for a desk job.The same night, Dorinda pours her heart out to Pete, who reluctantly opts to take the job if it means they will remain together. However, he is called to work an extra day fighting the current fire. As he and Al assault the leading edge of the blaze, Al's plane hits a burning tree, causing an engine fire. Pete makes a dangerously steep dive to drop a retardant load and extinguish Al's engine, but as he tries to pull up out of the wildfire's wrath, his own plane catches fire and explodes.Pete finds himself walking in a charred forest in the aftermath of a fire, where he comes upon a white-clad woman named Hap (Audrey Hepburn), standing on an oasis of green grass. Pete is stunned when Hap reveals to him that he is dead, but she then goes on to explain that his spirit will be sent back to inspire a rookie pilot by being heard as a thought. Six months after his demise, Pete sees his new protegé, Ted Baker (Brad Johnson), at the training base in Flat Rock; he is also delighted to find Al sitting behind the base commander's desk. Due to Ted's questionable record, Al is reluctant to take him on board, but a very loudly spoken ""thought"" from Pete convinces him to give Ted a chance.Al's students prove woefully unprepared to fight fire from the air - especially Ted, who (with guidance from Pete) accidentally dumps a load of retardant directly on Al and his assistant. Furious, Al orders Ted to take a hike before he departs for San Diego, where he finds Dorinda working as an air traffic controller. Al finds that Dorinda still has been unable to let go of Pete, so he brings her back to Flat Rock, where she rents a house at the edge of the airfield.In spite of Al's warning, Ted also returns to Flat Rock, determined to get his air attack certificate; but a malfunctioning guide tractor leads him straight to Dorinda's house. Pete speaks to Dorinda and is relieved to find that her heart still belongs to him. He continues to work with Ted, even as Ted spends more and more time with Dorinda, and - to Pete's anguish - begins to win her over. Again Pete meets Hap, who reminds him that he is wasting spirit by not letting go of Dorinda and trying to intercede between her and Ted.Ted shows some of the remarkable ability he has gained with Pete's guidance in the first major wildfire of the year. However, a distress call from a group of ground firefighters spurs him to fly a rescue mission. Unwilling to watch another lover fly to his death, Dorinda commandeers Ted's plane and flies the mission herself, with Pete attempting to talk her into turning back. When she presses on, Pete changes his approach and guides her through a harrowing flight in the thick of the huge fire, until she successfully drops a load of retardant to clear the firefighters' safe passage to the river.Pete tells Dorinda everything that he never got around to telling her when he was alive, but damage to the plane during the rescue mission forces her to make a splash landing in a lake. Sinking to the bottom, she seems about to accept her fate, but Pete appears before her, taking her hand to pull her to the surface. Back at the airfield, Ted and Al rush to greet Dorinda as Pete tells her that he is finally releasing her to her new life. As Dorinda and Ted meet with a loving embrace, Pete turns and walks away to his eternal reward."

"The movie starts with title and credits running over a giant bird's claw. The first scene is a globe circling in a cloudy mist and narration about man's technology allowing faster travel and RADAR needed for protection. We are told new radar installations must be calibrated by flying controlled test flights. In just such an installation, a radar officer (Morgan Jones) and Sally Caldwell (Mara Corday) are technical ground crew for a calibration test. Mitch MacAfee (Jeff Morrow) is the pilot flying a precision course, speed and altitude so the ground staff can do their calibration. Mitch asks if the Mathematician, Sally, has enough data to complete things. Sally wants one more run. As Mitch repositions his aircraft, he does a low buzz over the building upsetting Sally. The narrator tells us Mitch sees, ""Something that was almost the beginning of the end of life on this Earth."" A large dark shape crosses his path. He reports it immediately. The radar officer reports nothing on the scope. MacAfee claims something as big as a battleship flew past him at incredible speed. An alert was sounded to scramble interceptor jets from the Air Force Base.When Mitch gets back to base he inquires about the UFO he reported. Major Bergen (Clark Howat) is very unhappy. He tells Mitch if he were in the service hed have him locked up, but since hes a civilian he intends to report this to MacAfee's superiors. Bergen thinks the whole thing is a bad joke gone horribly wrong, as one of the interceptor jets did not return to base. He tells Mitch, ""Plane and pilot both are missing."" Bergen gets a phone call. MacAfee reiterates it was not a joke or a false alarm. The call was about a Transpolar Airlines plane reported overdue and missing. It had sixty passengers and a full crew aboard. The last call from the pilot was reporting a UFO. Sally and MacAfee take their arranged military transport to New York.Mitch and Sally are trying to work on their notes in the back of the airplane. The flight is experiencing turbulence. The pilot, Pete (Frank Griffin) tells Mitch he will climb over the bad weather over the Adirondack Mountains. He gets permission to climb to 12,000 feet. They are they are now in clear skies. Sally and Mitch continue their work in back. Pete sees a huge gray shape pass him. He calls Mitch back up front to tell him about the UFO. He thinks it might have been a cloud. The plane is jarred, like severe turbulence, and then it happens again. Sally is knocked to the cabin floor and Pete slams his head into the controls. Mitch takes over with one engine on fire. He crash lands in an open field. Mitch carries Pete outside with Sally right behind. They clear the wreckage as the airplane explodes. Flaming wreckage lands around them. Pete dies of his injuries. Pierre Broussard (Louis D. Merrill) witnesses the crash and calls out for survivors. He responds to Sally and Mitch and helps them to his cabin. He gives each of them a glass of homemade applejack while they wait for the authorities.A constable comes to the cabin that evening to take Pete's body. He's made arrangements for them to fly a commercial flight on to New York. He tells them a car will arrive soon to collect them. The phone rings. It is for Mitch. General Van Buskirk (Robert Shayne) wants to speak to him. He tells Mitch the Civil Aeronautics Board and the Air Force will investigate the crash. Mitch tells Sally what the General told him, ""When we get to New York, were to keep ourselves available for questioning."" There is a disturbance outside with the horse and dog. Pierre goes outside to investigate. He screams. Mitch and Sally step outside the cabin and find Pierre on the ground. He is stunned. They take him back inside and put him on the couch. He mumbles, ""Carcagne. It was the carcagne. I saw her."" Sally remembers the legend or superstition. The police arrive and Pierre tells them about what he saw. They came to collect Mitch and Sally. The policeman tells Mitch and Sally that if you see the big bird, it is a death omen. Pierre is hysterical and sobbing when they depart, leaving him in the care of one of the police officers.Mitch and Sally are flying to New York City. It is a night flight. Mitch tries to kiss her. She turns on the light and they talk. When she mentions the word pattern, Mitch reacts. He asks her for a chart. He sees a newspaper in the seat next to his and grabs it. The headline reads, ""Navy Patrol Plane Missing at Sea."" He puts an ""X"" at each place where a plane is destroyed. He connects all the marks to show a spiral pattern. They argue when Sally does not see the same pattern. They get loud enough to disturb the other passengers.A CAB plane flies towards the scene of the previous days crash. On board are four members of the Civil Aeronautics Board investigating team, and a pilot. The pilot spots a UFO and hears a squawking sound. A giant bird attacks the CAB plane. It looks like a giant vulture. The Investigators, all wearing parachutes, exit the plane. The crushed airplane is discarded and the parachutists are eaten one by one by the giant bird.At Mitch's apartment, he responds to the door buzzer. A military escort arrives to collect Mitch and take him to General Buzkirk. Mitch shows the general the chart he marked with his proposed pattern. Buzkirk tells him there have been two more incidents. When MacAfee tells him he only saw a blur and wished he had a camera, Sally remembers that film in test rockets and balloons may have photographed the creature. Cameras are returned to labs for processing and Mitch, Sally, and Buzkirk examine the photos. They see the bird and it is huge and ugly. Buzkirk flies to Washington, D.C. with Mitch and Sally.At the Pentagon, Lt. General Edward Considine (Morris Ankrum) examines the film strips showing the giant bird. Considine asks Sally if it could be flying in radar blind spots. He asks MacAfee if speed or altitude could affect the ability of radar to pick it up. The response to both questions is no. The phone rings and the general orders the creature shot down. They monitor Air Traffic communications. A squadron has spotted the bird and they open fire. Direct hits have no effect on the bird at all. It easily destroys the squadron. Considine gets a phone call from Dr. Karol Noymann (Edgar Barrier). He has analyzed the CAB wreckage and has found something. The general invites Mitch and Sally to accompany him to see Noymann.Dr. Noymann begins with a model of the atom. He explains that if there is matter there must also be antimatter. He postulates that the bird is from another dimension and is made of ordinary matter but radiates some sort of force, an energy screen. The screen is antimatter. Sally adds that this explains the failure of the radar. Dr. Noymann holds up a piece of feather from the bird. It has defied chemical analysis. He concludes, ""That bird is extraterrestrial. It comes from outer space, from some godforsaken antimatter galaxy millions and millions of light years from the Earth.""A world-wide panic ensues when the bird makes daring daylight raids around the globe. At his apartment, Mitch is working on a theory to destroy the bird's screen. He asks Sally to do some calculations. Sally wonders why the bird came to Earth--for food or to rest. Sally concludes the bird came here to build a nest. Mitch calls Buzkirk and asks for a plane and helicopter. He intends to return to Pierre's farm. General Considine gives a radio address explaining that with all aircraft grounded, the bird has taken to ground attacks on humans and livestock. The bird is attracted by movement. Therefore, the U.S. and all other world countries, have declared a state of emergency and instituted martial law.An Air Force plane takes Mitch and Sally to Pierre's farm. In the helicopter they search for the bird's nest. Pierre has joined them on the hunt. They spot a giant nest and see the bird land with more brush and trees to reinforce its nest. They spot the egg. Pierre panics and bolts. Sally grabs a rifle, but Mitch scores the first hit on the egg. It punctures a hole allowing the some of the contents to spill out. Sally makes a second and larger hole. The third shot, by Mitch, cracks the eggshell in half. The bird is furious and swoops low over their blind. It spots Pierre and kills him. They decide to drive out as the helicopter would be to easy a target for the bird. They take Pierre's car. Four teenagers in an open hot rod pass them on the road. They have their lights on, making them an easy target. Oblivious to the danger, Mitch and Sally warn them. The bird spots the car and picks it up in its talons and destroys it. Two of the teens are thrown clear and Mitch and Sally stop to assist them. They bring the kids to a hospital and then return to Washington.Mitch and Sally are working in a lab. Considine and Noymann arrive to hear Mitch's idea for getting past the antimatter screen. The answer is the generation and bombardment of Mu Meson particles at the bird. Noymann concurs, ""The formation of a temporary mesic atom, the mu meson with a hydrogen nucleus."" Considine asks him to start work right away. They build machine after machine all with no success. Meanwhile, the bird continues to reign destruction down on the Earth. Mitch manages to blow up the lab during one of his experiments. Dr. Noymann and Sally rush in to find Mitch out cold on the floor and the lab a shambles. He is still alive, so they take him to a hospital. Mitch explains that the explosion was not a failure. He did it on purpose. He used the mesic atom projector. He explains the wiring was fouled up, and that by adjusting the polarity on the main condenser terminals he was able to make it work.At the airfield, an old B-25 is employed to use against the bird. Buzkirk will fly as pilot and Considine as co-pilot. Noymann, Sally, and Mitch put the equipment on board. They will have to assemble the components in the air. The bird was spotted in New York City. It is perched on the Empire State Building. While they fly to their destination they are closer to final assembly of the components. They arrive to find the bird attacking the United Nations General Assembly Building. They make a close pass at the bird to get its attention. The giant bird follows, destroying a few more buildings in its pursuit. Mitch finally finishes the machine and they begin firing mesic atoms at the bird. The birds antimatter screen disappears in an explosive cloud. They fire rockets at the bird and it falls out of the sky into the ocean below. General Considine reports to the scientists aboard that they got their target. We close with the giant claw of the bird clenching closed and then sinking into the ocean."
